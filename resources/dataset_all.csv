 Mr. President 
 I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition   It is a national 
 feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything 
 that we Americans hold dear   It is a condition that comes from the lack of effective leadership 
 in either the Legislative Branch or the Executive Branch of our Government 
 That leadership is so lacking that serious and responsible proposals are being made that 
 national advisory commissions be appointed to provide such critically needed leadership 
 I speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has already been done with 
 irresponsible words of bitterness and selfish political opportunism   I speak as briefly as 
 possible because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence   I speak simply and 
 briefly in the hope that my words will be taken to heart 
  
  
 
       
 
 
 I speak as a Republican 
 I speak as a woman 
 I speak as a United States Senator 
 I speak as an American 
 The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative 
 body in the world   But recently that deliberative character has too often been debased to the 
 level of a forum of hate and character assassination   of congressional 
 immunity 
 It is ironical that we Senators can in debate in the Senate directly or  of 
 words impute to any American who is not a Senator any conduct or motive unworthy or 
 unbecoming an American and without that non Senator American having any legal redress 
 against us yet if we say the same thing in the Senate about our colleagues we can be 
 stopped on the grounds of being out of order 
 It is strange that we can verbally attack anyone else without restraint and with full protection 
 and yet we hold ourselves above the same type of criticism here on the Senate Floor   Surely 
 the United States Senate is big enough to take self criticism and self appraisal   Surely we 
 should be able to take the same kind of character attacks that we dish out to outsiders 
 I think that it is high time for the United States Senate and its members to do some soul- 
 searching for us to weigh our consciences on the manner in which we are performing our 
 duty to the people of America on the manner in which we are using or abusing our 
 individual powers and privileges 
 I think that it is high time that we remembered that we have sworn to uphold and defend the 
 Constitution   I think that it is high time that we remembered that the Constitution as 
 amended speaks not only of the freedom of speech but also of   of trial by 
 accusation 
 Whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a character prosecution in the Senate there is 
 little practical distinction when the life of a person has been ruined 
  
  
 
       
 
 
 Those of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in making character assassinations are 
 all too frequently those  words and acts ignore some of the basic principles 
 of Americanism 
             The right to criticize 
             The right to hold unpopular beliefs 
             The right to protest 
             The right of independent thought 
 The exercise of these rights should not cost one single American citizen his reputation or his 
 right to a livelihood nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or livelihood merely 
 because he happens to know someone who holds unpopular beliefs   Who of us does n’t  
 Otherwise none of us could call our souls our own   Otherwise thought control would have set 
 in 
 The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their minds lest they be 
 politically smeared as Communists or    Freedom of speech is 
 not what it used to be in America   It has been so   it is not exercised by 
 others 
 The American people are sick and tired of seeing innocent people smeared and guilty people 
 whitewashed   But there have been enough proved cases such as the Amerasia case the Hiss 
 case the Coplon case the Gold case to cause the nationwide distrust and strong suspicion 
 that there may be something to the unproved sensational accusations 
 As a Republican I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle that the Republican Party 
 faces a challenge today that is not unlike the challenge that it faced back in Lincoln ’s day The 
 Republican Party so successfully met that challenge that it emerged from the Civil War as the 
 champion of a united nation in addition to being a Party that unrelentingly fought loose 
 spending and loose programs 
 Today our country is being psychologically   and the suspicions that 
 are bred in the United States Senate to spread like cancerous tentacles of know nothing 
  
  
 
       
 
 
 suspect everything attitudes   Today we have a Democratic Administration that has 
 developed a mania for loose spending and loose programs 
 History is repeating itself and the Republican Party again has the opportunity to emerge as 
 the champion of unity and prudence 
 The record of the present Democratic Administration has provided us with sufficient campaign 
 issues without the necessity of resorting to political smears   America is rapidly losing its 
 position as leader of the world simply because the Democratic Administration has pitifully 
 failed to provide effective leadership 
 The Democratic Administration has completely confused the American  
 contradictory grave warnings and optimistic assurances that show the people that our 
 Democratic Administration has no idea of where it is going 
 The Democratic Administration has greatly lost the confidence of the American people by its 
 complacency to the threat of communism here at home and the leak of vital secrets to Russia 
 though key officials of the Democratic Administration   There are enough proved cases to 
 make this point without diluting our criticism with unproved charges 
 Surely these are sufficient reasons to make it clear to the American people that it is time for a 
 change and that a Republican victory is necessary to the security of this country   Surely it is 
 clear that this nation will continue to suffer as long as it is   ineffective 
 Democratic Administration 
 Yet to displace it with a Republican regime embracing a philosophy that lacks political integrity 
 or intellectual honesty would prove equally disastrous to this nation   The nation sorely needs 
 a Republican victory   But I do n’t want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on 
 the Four Horsemen of Calumny Fear Ignorance Bigotry and Smear 
 I doubt if the Republican Party could simply because I do n’t believe the American people 
 will uphold any political party that puts political exploitation above national interest   Surely 
 we Republicans are n’t that desperate for victory 
 I do n’t want to see the Republican Party win that way   While it might be a fleeting victory for 
 the Republican Party it would be a more lasting defeat for the American people   Surely it 
  
  
 
       
 
 
 would ultimately be suicide for the Republican Party and the two party system that has 
 protected our American liberties from the dictatorship of a one party system 
 As members of the Minority Party we do not have the primary authority to formulate the 
 policy of our Government   But we do have the responsibility of rendering constructive 
 criticism of clarifying issues of allaying   responsible citizens 
 As a woman I wonder how the mothers wives sisters and daughters feel about the way in 
 which members of their families have been politically mangled in the Senate debate and I 
 use the word debate advisedly 
 As a United States Senator I am not proud of the way in which the Senate has been made a 
 publicity platform for irresponsible sensationalism   I am not proud of the reckless abandon in 
 which unproved charges have been hurled from this side of the aisle   I am not proud of the 
 obviously staged undignified countercharges that have been attempted in retaliation from the 
 other side of the aisle 
 I do n’t like the way the Senate has been made a rendezvous for vilification for selfish political 
 gain at the sacrifice of individual reputations and national unity   I am not proud of the way 
 we smear outsiders from the Floor of the Senate and hide behind the cloak of congressional 
 immunity and still place ourselves beyond criticism on the Floor of the Senate 
 As an American I am shocked at the way Republicans and Democrats alike are playing 
 directly into the Communist design of confuse divide and conquer   As an American I do n’t 
 want a Democratic Administration whitewash or cover up any more than I want a 
 Republican smear or witch hunt 
 As an American I condemn a Republican Fascist just as much I condemn a Democratic 
 Communist   I condemn a Democrat Fascist just as much as I condemn a Republican 
 Communist   They are equally dangerous to you and me and to our country   As an 
 American I want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we 
 fought the enemy instead of ourselves 
 It is with these thoughts that I have drafted what I call a Declaration of Conscience   I am 
 gratified that Senator Tobey Senator Aiken Senator Morse Senator Ives Senator Thye and 
 Senator Hendrickson have concurred in that declaration and have authorized me to announce 
 their concurrence 
  
  
 
       
 
 
 The declaration reads as follows  
 1 We are Republicans But we are Americans first It is as Americans that we express 
 our concern with the growing confusion that threatens the security and stability of our 
 country Democrats and Republicans alike have contributed to that confusion  
 2 The Democratic administration has initially created the   of 
 effective  grave warnings and optimistic assurances by 
 its complacency to the threat of communism here at  to 
 rightful  bitterness against its critics  
 3 Certain elements of the Republican Party have materially added to this confusion in 
 the hopes of riding the Republican party to victory through the selfish political 
 exploitation of fear bigotry ignorance and intolerance There are enough mistakes of 
 the Democrats for Republicans to criticize constructively without resorting to political 
 smears  
 4 To this extent Democrats and Republicans alike have unwittingly but undeniably 
 played directly into the Communist design of confuse divide and conquer  
 5 It is high time that we stopped thinking politically as Republicans and Democrats 
 about elections and started thinking patriotically as Americans about national security 
 based on individual freedom It is high time that we all stopped being tools and victims 
 of totalitarian techniques techniques that if continued here unchecked will surely 
 end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life",0.0473218075931072,0.0037057786248624,0.9123521447181702,0.0032705566845834,0.0105542801320552,0.0219177082180976,0.000877805869095,0.0599021018663875,0.4615672907339572,35.392404557685865,0.2837723024638912,0.009794776119402986,0.0767656090071648,0.05975485188968335,26.146341463414632,1.0
1,Richard M. Nixon,Checkers Speech,1952," 
 
 
 My Fellow Americans 
 
 I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency and as a man whose honesty 
 and and integrity has been questioned 
 
 Now the usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore 
 them or to deny them without giving details I believe we 've had enough of that in the United 
 States particularly with the present Administration in Washington D.C. To me the office of 
 the Vice Presidency of the United States is a great office and I feel that the people have got 
 to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it 
 
 I have a theory too that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest 
 misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth And that 's why I 'm here tonight I want to 
 tell you my side of the case I 'm sure that you have read the charge and you 've heard it that 
 I Senator Nixon took 18,000 dollars from a group of my supporters 
 
  
  
 
   
            
 Now was that wrong And let me say that it was wrong I 'm saying incidentally that it was 
 wrong not just illegal because it is n't a question of whether it was legal or illegal that is n't 
 enough The question is was it morally wrong I say that it was morally wrong if any of 
 that 18,000 dollars went to Senator Nixon for my personal use I say that it was morally 
 wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled And I say that it was morally wrong if any 
 of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made 
 
 And now to answer those questions let me say this Not one cent of the 18,000 dollars or any 
 other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use Every penny of it was used to 
 pay for political expenses that I did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the United 
 States   It was not a secret fund As a matter of   fact when I was on Meet the Press some 
 of you may have seen it last Sunday Peter Edson came up to me after the program and he 
 said Dick what about this fund we hear about And I said Well there 's no secret about 
 it Go out and see Dana Smith who was the administrator of the fund And I gave him 
 Edson his Smith 's address And I said you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was 
 to defray political expenses that I did not feel should be charged to the Government 
 
 And third let me point out and I want to make this particularly clear that no contributor 
 to this fund no contributor to any of my campaigns has ever received any consideration that 
 he would not have received as an ordinary constituent I just do n't believe in that and I can 
 say that never while I have been in the Senate of the United States as far as the people that 
 contributed to this fund are concerned have I made a telephone call for them to an agency 
 or have I gone down to an agency in their behalf And the records will show that the records 
 which are in the hands of the Administration 
 
 Well then some of you will say and rightly Well what did you use the fund for Senator 
 Why did you have to have it Let me tell you in just a word how a Senate office operates 
 First of all a Senator gets 15,000 dollars a year in salary He gets enough money to pay for 
 one trip a year a round trip that is for himself and his family between his home and 
 Washington D.C. And then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office 
 to handle his mail And the allowance for my State of California is enough to hire 13 people 
 And let me say incidentally that that allowance is not paid to the Senator It 's paid directly to 
 the individuals that the Senator puts on his payroll But all of these people and all of these 
 allowances are for strictly official business business for example when a constituent writes 
 in and wants you to go down to the Veteran 's Administration and get some information about 
 his GI policy items of that type for example But there are other expenses which are not 
  And I think I can best discuss those  
 some questions 
  
  
 
   
            
 
 Do you think that when I or any other Senator makes a political speech has it printed should 
 charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers Do you 
 think for example when I or any other Senator makes a trip to his home State to make a 
 purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers Do you 
 think when a Senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts radio or 
 television that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers Well I 
 know what your answer is It 's the same answer that audiences give me whenever I discuss 
 this particular problem The answer is no The taxpayers should n't be required to finance 
 items which are not official business but which are primarily political business 
 
 Well then the question arises you say Well how do you pay for these and how can you do 
 it legally And there are several ways that it can be done incidentally and that it is done 
 legally in the United States Senate and in the Congress The first way is to be a rich man I 
 do n't happen to be a rich man so I could n't use that one Another way that is used is to put 
 your wife on the payroll Let me say incidentally that my opponent my opposite number for 
 the Vice Presidency on the Democratic ticket does have his wife on the payroll and has had it 
 her on his payroll for the ten years for the past ten years Now just let me say this 
 That 's his business and I 'm not critical of him for doing that You will have to pass judgment 
 on that particular point But I have never done that for this reason I have found that there 
 are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in Washington that needed the work 
 that I just did n't feel it was right to put my wife on the payroll 
 
 My wife 's sitting over here She 's a wonderful stenographer She used to teach stenography 
 and she used to teach shorthand in high school That was when I met her And I can tell you 
 folks that she 's worked many hours at night and many hours on Saturdays and Sundays in my 
 office and she 's done a fine job and I am proud to say tonight that in the six years I 've been 
 in the House and the Senate of the United States Pat Nixon has never been on the 
 Government payroll 
 
 What are other ways that these finances can be taken care of Some who are lawyers and I 
 happen to be a lawyer continue to practice law but I have n't been able to do that I 'm so far 
 away from California that I 've been so busy with my senatorial work that I have not engaged 
 in any legal practice And also as far as law practice is concerned it seemed to me that the 
 relationship between an attorney and the client was so personal that you could n't possibly 
 represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case 
 to you in the event that he had one before Government 
 
  
  
 
   
            
 And so I felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my 
 message to the American people and the speeches I made the speeches that I had printed 
 for the most part concerned this one message of exposing this Administration the 
 Communism in it the corruption in it the only way that I could do that was to accept the 
 aid which people in my home State of California who contributed to my campaign and who 
 continued to make these contributions after I was elected were glad to make 
 
 And let me say I 'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special 
 favor I 'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other 
 than of my own conscience would dictate And I am proud of the fact that the taxpayers by 
 subterfuge or otherwise have never paid one dime for expenses which I thought were political 
 and should n't be charged to the taxpayers 
 
 Let me say incidentally that some of you may say Well that 's all right Senator that 's your 
 explanation but have you got any proof And I 'd like to tell you this evening that just an 
 hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund I suggested to Governor 
 Sherman Adams who is the Chief of Staff of the Dwight Eisenhower campaign that an 
 independent audit and legal report be obtained and I have that audit here in my hands It 's 
 an audit   Waterhouse Company firm and the legal opinion by Gibson 
 Dunn Crutcher lawyers in Los Angeles the biggest law firm and incidentally one of the 
 best ones in Los Angeles 
 
 I am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being 
 forwarded to General Eisenhower And I 'd like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by 
 Gibson Dunn Crutcher and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes together with the 
 audit report   public accountants Quote 
 
 It is our conclusion that Senator Nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the 
 collection and disbursement of the that Senator Nixon did not 
 violate any federal or state   the operation of the fund and that neither 
 the portion of the fund   directly to third persons nor the portion 
 paid to Senator Nixon to reimburse him for designated office expenses constituted 
 income to the Senator which was either reportable or taxable as income under 
 applicable tax laws 
           signed 
           Gibson Dunn Crutcher 
           by Elmo H. Conley 
 
  
  
 
   
            
 Now that my friends is not Nixon speaking but that 's an independent audit which was 
 requested because I want the American people to know all the facts and I am not afraid of 
 having independent people go in and check the facts and that is exactly what they did But 
 then I realized that there are still some who may say and rightfully so and let me say that I 
 recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be but that 
 there has been understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter and there are 
 some that will say Well maybe you were able Senator to fake this thing How can we 
 believe what you say After all is there a possibility that maybe you got some sums in cash 
 Is there a possibility that you may have feathered your own nest 
 
 And so now what I am going to do and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of 
 American politics I am going at this time to give to this television and radio audio 
 audience a complete financial history everything I 've earned everything I 've spent 
 everything I own And I want you to know the facts 
 
 I 'll have to start early I was born in 1913 Our family was one of modest circumstances and 
 most of my early life was spent in a store out in East Whittier It was a grocery store one of 
 those family enterprises The only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother 
 and dad had five boys and we all worked in the store I worked my way through college and 
 to a great extent through law school And then in 1940 probably the best thing that ever 
 happened to me happened I married Pat who 's sitting over here We had a rather difficult 
 time after we were married like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us I 
 practiced law She continued to teach school 
 
 Then in 1942 I went into the service Let me say that my service record was not a 
 particularly unusual one I went to the South Pacific I guess I 'm entitled to a couple of battle 
 stars I got a couple of letters of commendation But I was just there when the bombs were 
 falling And then I returned returned to the United States and in 1946 I ran for the 
 Congress When we came out of the war Pat and I Pat during the war had worked as a 
 stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for a Government agency and when we 
 came out the total of our savings from both my law practice her teaching and all the time 
 that I was in the war the total for that entire period was just a little less than 10,000 dollars 
 Every cent of that incidentally was in Government bonds Well that 's where we start when I 
 go into politics 
 
 Now what have I earned since I went into politics Well here it is I 've jotted it down Let me 
 read the notes First of all I 've had my salary as a Congressman and as a Senator Second I 
 have received a total in this past six years of 1600 dollars from estates which were in my law 
  
  
 
   
            
 firm at the time that I severed my connection with it And incidentally as I said before I 
 have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that 
 came into the firm after I went into politics I have made an average of approximately 1500 
 dollars a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures 
 
 And then fortunately we 've inherited a little money Pat sold her interest in her father 's 
 estate for 3,000 dollars and I inherited 1500 dollars from my grandfather We lived rather 
 modestly For four years we lived in an apartment in Parkfairfax in Alexandria Virginia The 
 rent was 80 dollars a month And we saved for the time that we could buy a house Now that 
 was what we took in What did we do with this money What do we have today to show for it 
 This will surprise you because it is so little I suppose as standards generally go of people in 
 public life 
 
 First of all we 've got a house in Washington which cost 41,000 dollars and on which we owe 
 20,000 dollars We have a house in Whittier California which cost 13,000 dollars and on which 
 we owe 3000 dollars My folks are living there at the present time I have just 4000 dollars in 
 life insurance plus my GI policy which I 've never been able to convert and which will run out 
 in two years I have no life insurance whatever on Pat I have no life insurance on our two 
 youngsters Tricia and Julie I own a 1950 Oldsmobile car We have our furniture We have no 
 stocks and bonds of any type We have no interest of any kind direct or indirect in any 
 business Now that 's what we have What do we owe 
 
 Well in addition to the mortgage the 20,000 dollar mortgage on the house in Washington the 
 10,000 dollar one on the house in Whittier I owe 4500 dollars to the Riggs Bank in 
 Washington D.C. with interest 4 and 1/2 percent I owe 3500 dollars to my parents and the 
 interest on that loan which I pay regularly because it 's the part of the savings they made 
 through the years they were working so hard I pay regularly 4 percent interest And then I 
 have a 500 dollar loan which I have on my life insurance 
 
 Well that 's about it That 's what we have And that 's what we owe It is n't very much But Pat 
 and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we 've got is honestly ours I should say this 
 that Pat does n't have a mink coat But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat and 
 I always tell her she 'd look good in anything 
 
 One other thing I probably should tell you because if I do n't they 'll probably be saying this 
 about me too We did get something a gift after the election 
 
  
  
 
   
            
 A man down in Texas heard Pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would 
 like to have a dog And believe it or not the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a 
 message from Union Station in Baltimore saying they had a package for us We went down to 
 get it You know what it was 
 
 It was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he 'd sent all the way from Texas black and 
 white spotted And our little girl Tricia the six year old named it Checkers And you know 
 the kids like all kids love the dog and I just want to say this right now that regardless of 
 what they say about it we 're gon na keep it 
 
 It is n't easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life as I 've done But I want 
 to say some things before I conclude that I think most of you will agree on Mr. Mitchell the 
 Chairman of the Democratic National Committee made this statement that if a man 
 could n't afford to be in the United States Senate he should n't run for the Senate And I just 
 want to make my position clear I do n't agree with Mr. Mitchell when he says that only a rich 
 man should serve his Government in the United States Senate or in the Congress I do n't 
 believe that represents the thinking of the Democratic Party and I know that it does n't 
 represent the thinking of the Republican Party 
 
 I believe that it 's fine that a man like Governor Stevenson who inherited a fortune from his 
 father can run for President But I also feel that it 's essential in this country of ours that a 
 man of modest means can also run for President because you know remember Abraham 
 Lincoln you remember what he said God must have loved the common people he made 
 so many of them 
 
 And now I 'm going to suggest some courses of conduct First of all you have read in the 
 papers about other funds now Mr. Stevenson apparently had a couple one of them in 
 which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of State 
 employees Here is where the money went directly into their pockets and I think that what 
 Mr. Stevenson should do should be to come before the American people as I have give the 
 names of the people that contributed to that fund give the names of the people who put this 
 money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their State 
 government and see what favors if any they gave out for that 
 
 I do n't condemn Mr. Stevenson for what he did but until the facts are in there is a doubt that 
 will be raised And as far as Mr. Sparkman is concerned I would suggest the same thing He 's 
 had his wife on the payroll I do n't condemn him for that but I think that he should come 
 before the American people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had I would 
  
  
 
   
            
 suggest that under the circumstances both Mr. Sparkman and Mr. Stevenson should come 
 before the American people as I have and make a complete financial statement as to their 
 financial history and if they do n't it will be an admission that they have something to hide 
 And I think you will agree with me because folks remember a man that 's to be President 
 of the United States a man that 's to be Vice President of the United States must have the 
 confidence of all the people And that 's why I 'm doing what I 'm doing And that 's why I 
 suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what 
 they 're doing 
 
 Now let me say this I know that this is not the last of the smears In spite of my explanation 
 tonight other smears will be made Others have been made in the past And the purpose of 
 the smears I know is this to silence me to make me let up Well they just do n't know who 
 they 're dealing with I 'm going to tell you this I remember in the dark days of the Hiss case 
 some of the same columnists some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me 
 now and misrepresenting my position were violently opposing me at the time I was after 
 Alger Hiss But I continued to fight because I knew I was right and I can say to this great 
 television and radio audience that I have no apologies to the American people for my part in 
 putting Alger Hiss where he is today And as far as this is concerned I intend to continue to 
 fight 
 
 Why do I feel so deeply Why do I feel that in spite of the smears the misunderstanding the 
 necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as I have why is it necessary for me 
 to continue this fight And I want to tell you why Because you see I love my country And I 
 think my country is in danger And I think the only man that can save America at this time is 
 the man that 's running for President on my ticket Dwight Eisenhower You say Why do I 
 think it is in danger And I say look at the record Seven years of the Truman Acheson 
 Administration and what 's happened Six hundred million people lost to the Communists And 
 a war in Korea in which we have lost 117,000 American casualties and I say to all of you that 
 a policy that results in the loss of 600 million people to the Communists and a war which cost 
 us 117,000 American casualties is n't good enough for America And I say that those in the 
 State Department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those 
 losses should be kicked out of the State Department just as fast as we get them out of there 
 
 And let me say that I know Mr. Stevenson wo n't do that because he defends the Truman 
 policy and I know that Dwight Eisenhower will do that and that he will give America the 
 leadership that it needs Take the problem of corruption You 've read about the mess in 
 Washington Mr. Stevenson ca n't clean it up because he was Truman 
 under whose Administration the mess was made You would n't trust the man who made the 
  
  
 
   
            
 mess to clean it up That 's Truman   token you ca n't trust the man who was 
  that made the mess to clean it up and that 's Stevenson 
 
 And so I say Eisenhower who owed nothing to Truman nothing to the big city bosses he is 
 the man that can clean up the mess in Washington Take Communism I say that as far as 
 that subject is concerned the danger is great to America In the Hiss case they got the secrets 
 which enabled them to break the American secret State Department code They got secrets in 
 the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years 
 before they would have gotten   devices And I say that any man who called the 
 Alger Hiss case a red herring is n't fit to be President of the United States I say that a man 
 who like Mr. Stevenson has pooh poohed and ridiculed the Communist threat in the United 
 States he said that they are phantoms among ourselves He has accused us that have 
 attempted to expose the Communists of looking for Communists in the Bureau of Fisheries 
 and Wildlife I say that a man who says that is n't qualified to be President of the United 
 States And I say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the Government of 
 both those who are Communists and those who have corrupted this Government is 
 Eisenhower because Eisenhower you can be sure recognizes the problem and he knows 
 how to deal with it 
 
 Now let me that finally this evening I want to read to you just briefly excerpts from a letter 
 which I received a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us It reads as 
 follows 
 Dear Senator Nixon  
 Since I am only 19 years of age I ca n't vote in this presidential election but believe 
 me if I could you and General Eisenhower would certainly get my vote My husband is 
 in the Fleet Marines in Korea He a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two 
 month old son he 's never seen And I feel confident that with great Americans like you 
 and General Eisenhower in the White House lonely Americans like myself will be united 
 with their loved ones now in Korea I only pray to God that you wo n't be too late 
 Enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign Living on $ 85 a month it is all 
 I can afford at present but let me know what else I can do 
 Folks it 's a check for 10 dollars and it 's one that I will never cash And just let me say this 
 We hear a lot about prosperity these days but I say why ca n't we have prosperity built on 
 peace rather than prosperity built on war Why ca n't we have prosperity and an honest 
 Government in Washington D.C. at the same time Believe me we can And Eisenhower is 
 the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity 
 
  
  
 
   
            0 
 And now finally I know that you wonder whether or not I am going to stay on the Republican 
 ticket or resign Let me say this I do n't believe that I ought to quit because I am not a 
 quitter And incidentally Pat 's not a quitter After all her name was Patricia Ryan and she 
 was born on St. Patrick 's day and you know the Irish never quit 
 
 But the decision my friends is not mine I would do nothing that would harm the possibilities 
 of Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States And for that reason I am 
 submitting to the Republican National Committee tonight through this television broadcast the 
 decision which it is theirs to make Let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help 
 or hurt And I am going to ask you to help them decide Wire and write the Republican 
 National Committee whether you think I should stay on or whether I should get off And 
 whatever their decision is I will abide by it 
 
 But just let me say this last word Regardless of what happens I 'm going to continue this 
 fight I 'm going to campaign up and down in America until we drive the crooks and the 
 Communists and those that defend them out of Washington And remember folks Eisenhower 
 is a great man believe me He 's a great man And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what 's 
 good for America And what 's good for America interrupted by announcer",0.3288832306861877,0.1395308375358581,0.3491034507751465,0.0149689922109246,0.1235234439373016,0.0375946462154388,0.0063953651115298,0.1238724867724868,0.4753183285849952,63.04235085358678,0.1607413010590015,0.014574187884108867,0.07065217391304347,0.030249459831074445,22.963709677419356,1.0
2,Franklin D. Roosevelt,Pearl Harbor Address to the Nation,1941," 
 
 
 Mr. Vice President Mr. Speaker Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives 
 Yesterday December 7th 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of 
 America was suddenly and deliberately   air forces of the Empire of 
 Japan 
 The United States was at peace with that nation and at the solicitation of Japan was still in 
 conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in 
 the Pacific 
 Indeed one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American 
 island of Oahu the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to 
 our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message And while this reply 
 stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations it contained no 
 threat or hint of war or of armed attack.1 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
                                 
 It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack 
 was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago During the intervening time the 
 Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false 
 statements and expressions of hope for continued peace 
 The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval 
 and military forces I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost In 
 addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San 
 Francisco and Honolulu 
 Yesterday the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya 
 Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong 
 Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam 
 Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands 
 Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island 
 And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island 
 Japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area 
 The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves The people of the United States have 
 already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety 
 of our nation 
 As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for 
 our defense But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught 
 against us 
 No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion the American 
 people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory 
 I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will 
 not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of 
 treachery shall never again endanger us 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
                                 
 Hostilities exist There is no blinking at the fact that our people our territory and our 
 interests are in grave danger 
 With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we will 
 gain the inevitable triumph so help us God 
 I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly  
 Sunday December 7th 1941 a state of war has existed between the United States and the 
 Japanese empire 
 
 1 Narrowly considered it is true that the formal reply contained no definitively expressed statements of actionable immanent hostility Within a 
 wider geopolitical context however and from the perspective of key actors within the Japanese government the perceived threat posed by the 
 U.S. to Japan 's regional interests and ambitions had been building for some time and to such an extent that the launching of Japan 's Pacific 
 campaign had reached the status of fait accompli well before its representatives had delivered their final reply See for example this useful 
 timeline and commentary from the Japan Center for Asian Historical Records Shirer ’s Rise and Fall of the Third Reich offers instructive details 
 on this matter from a different direction",0.0773782655596733,0.0279705971479415,0.7082329988479614,0.0167855489999055,0.043711457401514,0.106113500893116,0.0198075324296951,0.0197719353816914,0.2588153310104529,39.843307086614175,0.4342105263157895,0.02913907284768212,0.1362397820163488,0.1154970760233918,25.166666666666668,1.0
3,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,The Four Freedoms,1941," 
 
 
 
 Mr. President Mr. Speaker members of the 77th Congress 
 I address you the members of this new Congress at a moment unprecedented in the history 
 of the union   I use the word unprecedented because at no previous time has American 
 security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today 
 Since the permanent formation of our government under the Constitution in 1789 most of the 
 periods of crisis in our history have related to our domestic affairs   And fortunately only one 
 of these the four year war between the States ever threatened our national unity  
 Today thank God 130,000,000 Americans in 48 States have forgotten points of the compass 
 in our national unity 
 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 It is true that prior to 1914 the United States often has been   other 
 continents   We have even engaged in two wars with European nations and in a number of 
 undeclared wars in the West Indies in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific for the 
 maintenance of American rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce   But in no case 
 had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our continued independence 
 What I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a nation has at all times 
 maintained opposition clear definite opposition to any attempt to lock us in behind an 
 ancient Chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past Today thinking of our 
 children and of their children we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part 
 of the Americas 
 That determination of ours extending over all these years was proved for example in the 
 early days during the quarter century of wars following the French Revolution   While the 
 Napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the United States because of the French 
 foothold in the West Indies and in Louisiana and while we engaged in the War of 1812 to 
 vindicate our right to peaceful trade it is nevertheless clear that neither France nor Great 
 Britain nor any other nation was aiming at domination of the whole world 
 And in like fashion from 1815 to 1914 ninety nine years no single war in Europe or in 
 Asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other American 
 nation 
 Except in the Maximilian interlude in Mexico no foreign power sought to establish itself in this 
 hemisphere And the strength of the British fleet in the Atlantic has been a friendly strength it 
 is still a friendly strength 
 Even when the World War broke out in 1914 it seemed to contain only small threat of danger 
 to our own American future   But as time went on as we remember the American people 
 began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own 
 democracy 
 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 We need not overemphasize imperfections in the peace of Versailles We need not harp on 
 failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction We should remember 
 that the peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of pacification which began even 
 before Munich and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to 
 spread over every continent today The American people have unalterably set their faces 
 against that tyranny 
 I suppose that every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being 
 directly assailed in every part of the world assailed   by secret spreading of 
 poisonous   seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that 
 are still at peace During 16 long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of 
 democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations great and small   And the 
 assailants are still on the march threatening other nations great and small 
 Therefore as your President performing my constitutional duty to give to the Congress 
 information of the state of the union I find it unhappily necessary to report that the future 
 and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far 
 beyond our borders 
 Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents   If 
 that defense fails all the population and all the resources of Europe and Asia and Africa and 
 Austral Asia will be dominated by conquerors   And let us remember that the total of those 
 populations in those four continents the total of those populations and their resources greatly 
 exceed the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western 
 Hemisphere yes many times over 
 In times like these it is immature and incidentally untrue for anybody to brag that an 
 unprepared America single handed and with one hand tied behind its back can hold off the 
 whole world 
 No realistic American can expect from a dictator ’s peace international generosity or return of 
 true independence or world disarmament or freedom of expression or freedom of religion 
 or even good business   Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors  
 Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve 
 neither liberty nor safety 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 As a nation we may take pride in the fact that we are soft hearted but we can not afford to be 
 soft headed   We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling 
 cymbal preach the ism of appeasement   We must especially beware of that small group of 
 selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own 
 nests 
 I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our 
 very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this 
 war 
 There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the 
 seas   Obviously as long as the British Navy retains its power no such danger exists   Even if 
 there were no British Navy it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to 
 attack   in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean until 
 it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate 
 But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe particularly the lesson of 
 Norway whose essential seaports were   surprise built up over a 
 series of years The first phase of the invasion of this hemisphere would not be the landing of 
 regular troops   The necessary strategic points would be   and by 
 their dupes and great numbers of them are already here and in Latin America As long as 
 the aggressor nations maintain the offensive they not we will choose the time and the place 
 and the method of their attack 
 And that is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious danger   That is 
 why this annual message to the Congress is unique in our history   That is why every member 
 of the executive branch of the government and every member of the Congress face great 
 responsibility great accountability The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy 
 should be devoted primarily almost exclusively to meeting this foreign peril   For all our 
 domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency 
 Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the 
 rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates so our national policy in foreign 
 affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all nations large 
 and small   And the justice of morality must and will win in the end 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 Our national policy is this 
  expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship 
 we are committed to all inclusive national defense 
  expression of the public will and without regard to 
 partisanship we are committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere 
 who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our 
 hemisphere By this support we express our determination that the democratic cause 
 shall prevail and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation 
  expression of the public will and without regard to 
 partisanship we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and 
 considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace 
  We know that enduring peace 
 can not be bought at the cost of other people 's freedom 
 In the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great 
 parties in respect to that national policy No issue was fought out on this line before the 
 American electorate   And today it is abundantly evident that American citizens everywhere 
 are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger 
 Therefore the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production 
 Leaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons Goals of speed have been 
 set In some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time In some cases we are on 
 schedule in other cases there are slight but not serious delays And in some cases and I 
 am sorry to say very important cases we are all   of the 
 accomplishment of our plans 
 The Army and Navy however have made substantial progress during the past year Actual 
 experience is improving and speeding up our methods of production with every passing 
 day And today 's best is not good enough for tomorrow 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 I am not satisfied with the progress thus far made The men in charge of the program 
 represent the best in training in ability and in patriotism They are not satisfied with the 
 progress thus far made   None of us will be satisfied until the job is done 
 No matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low our objective is quicker and 
 better results 
 To give you two illustrations 
 We are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes We are working day and night to 
 solve the innumerable problems and to catch up 
 We are ahead of schedule in building warships but we are working to get even further ahead 
 of that schedule 
 To change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements of peace to a 
 basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small task And the greatest difficulty 
 comes at the beginning of the program when new tools new plant facilities new assembly 
 lines new shipways must first be constructed before the actual material begins to flow 
 steadily and speedily from them 
 The Congress of course must rightly keep itself informed at all times of the progress of the 
 program   However there is certain information as the Congress itself will readily recognize 
 which in the interests of our own security and those of the nations that we are supporting 
 must of needs be kept in confidence 
 New circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety I shall ask this 
 Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we 
 have begun 
 I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional 
 munitions and war supplies of many kinds to be turned over to those nations which are now 
 in actual war with aggressor nations Our most useful and immediate role is to act as an 
 arsenal for them as well as for ourselves They do not need manpower but they do need 
 billions of dollars worth of the weapons of defense 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash   We can not and 
 we will not tell them that they must surrender merely because of present inability to pay for 
 the weapons which we know they must have 
 I do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons 
 a loan to be repaid in dollars I recommend that we make it possible for those nations to 
 continue to obtain war materials in the United States fitting their orders into our own 
 program And nearly all of their material would if the time ever came be useful in our own 
 defense 
 Taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities considering what is best for our own 
 security we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent 
 abroad to our friends  and heroic resistance are giving us time in 
 which to make ready our own defense 
 For what we send abroad we shall be repaid repaid within a reasonable time following the 
 close of hostilities repaid in similar materials or at our option in other goods of many kinds 
 which they can produce and which we need 
 Let us say to the democracies We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of 
 freedom We are putting forth our energies our resources and our organizing powers to give 
 you the strength to regain and maintain a free world We shall send you in ever increasing 
 numbers ships planes tanks guns That is our purpose and our pledge 
 In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be   of dictators that they 
 will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies 
 which dare to resist their aggression Such aid Such aid is not an act of war even if a 
 dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be 
 And when the dictators if the dictators are ready to make war upon us they will not wait 
 for an act of war on our part 
 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war Their 
 only interest is in a new one way international law which lacks mutuality in its observance 
 and therefore becomes an instrument of oppression The happiness of future generations of 
 Americans may well depend on how effective and how immediate we can make our aid 
 felt No one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called 
 upon to meet The nation 's hands must not be tied when the nation 's life is in danger 
 Yes and we must prepare all of us prepare to make the sacrifices that the emergency 
 almost as serious as war itself demands Whatever stands in the way of speed and 
 efficiency in defense in defense preparations of any kind must give way to the national need 
 A free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups A free nation has the 
 right to look to the leaders of business of labor and of agriculture to take the lead in 
 stimulating effort not among other groups but within their own group 
 The best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our midst is first to 
 shame and if that fails to use the sovereignty of government to 
 save government 
 As men do not they do not   Those who man our 
 defenses and those behind them who build our defenses must have the stamina and the 
 courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are 
 defending The mighty action that we are calling for can not be based on a disregard of all the 
 things worth fighting for 
 The nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done 
 to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in 
 America   Those things have toughened the fiber of our people have renewed their faith and 
 strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect 
 Certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems 
 which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the 
 world For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong 
 democracy 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 The basic things   of their political and economic systems are 
 simple They are 
 Equality of opportunity for youth and for others 
 Jobs for those who can work 
 Security for those who need it 
 The ending of special privilege for the few 
 The preservation of civil liberties for all 
 The enjoyment The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and 
 constantly rising standard of living 
 These are the simple the basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and 
 unbelievable complexity of our modern world The inner and abiding strength of our economic 
 and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations 
 Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement As 
 examples 
 We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old age pensions and unemployment 
 insurance 
 We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care 
 We should plan a better   deserving or needing gainful employment 
 may obtain it 
 I have called for personal sacrifice and I am assured of the willingness of almost all 
 Americans to respond to that call A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money 
 in taxes In my budget message I will recommend that a greater portion of this great defense 
 program be paid for from taxation than we are paying for today 
  
  
 
 
 
            0 
 No person should try or be allowed to get rich out of the program and the principle of tax 
 payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our 
 legislation 
 If the Congress maintains these principles the voters putting patriotism ahead pocketbooks 
 will give you their applause 
 In the future days which we seek to make secure we look forward to a world founded upon 
 four essential human freedoms 
 
 The first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world 
 The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way everywhere 
 in the world 
 The third is freedom from want which translated into world terms means economic 
 understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its 
 inhabitants everywhere in the world 
 The fourth is freedom from fear which translated into world terms means a world- 
 wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no 
 nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any 
 neighbor anywhere in the world 
  
  
 
 
 
            1 
 That is no vision of a distant millennium It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in 
 our own time and generation That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so called new 
 order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb 
 To that new order we oppose the greater conception the moral order A good society is able 
 to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear 
 Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change in a perpetual 
 peaceful revolution a revolution which goes on steadily quietly adjusting itself to changing 
 conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch The world order which 
 we seek is the cooperation of free countries working together in a friendly civilized society 
 This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men 
 and women and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God Freedom means the 
 supremacy of human rights everywhere Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those 
 rights and keep them Our strength is our unity of purpose 
 To that high concept there can be no end save victory",0.00548428716138,0.001581710181199,0.978206992149353,0.0022036537993699,0.006677926518023,0.0029869680292904,0.0028584722895175,0.1671408079100386,0.4202044628143526,49.14491372843213,0.2917669715936447,0.012843112566104256,0.0743124634289058,0.04149377593360996,25.954248366013072,1.0
4,Geraldine Ferraro,Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address,1984," 
 
 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the convention 
 My name is Geraldine Ferraro I stand before you to proclaim tonight America is the land 
 where dreams can come true for all of us As I stand before the American people and think of 
 the honor this great convention has bestowed upon me I recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther 
 King Jr. who made America   more free He said Occasionally in 
 life there are moments which can not be completely  meaning can 
 only be   language of the heart Tonight is such a moment for me 
 My heart is filled with pride My fellow citizens I proudly accept your nomination for Vice 
 President of the United States 
 And I am proud to run with a man who will be one of the great Presidents of this century 
 Walter F. Mondale Tonight the daughter of a woman whose highest goal was a future for her 
 children talks to our nation 's oldest party about a future for us all 
  
  
 
                          
       
 Tonight the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our 
 reach if we 're willing to reach for it Tonight the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has 
 been chosen to run for Vice President in the new land my father came to love 
 Our faith that we can shape a better future is what the American dream is all about The 
 promise of our country is that the rules are fair If you work hard and you 
 can earn your share of America 's blessings Those are the beliefs I learned from my parents 
 And those are the values I taught my students as a teacher in the public schools of New York 
 City 
 At night I went to law school I became an assistant district attorney and I put my share of 
 criminals behind bars I believe if you obey the law you should be protected But if you break 
 the law you must pay for your crime 
 When I first ran for Congress all the political experts said a Democrat could not win my home 
 district in Queens I put my faith in the people and the values that we shared Together we 
 proved the political experts wrong In this campaign Fritz Mondale and I have put our faith in 
 the people And we are going to prove the experts wrong again We are going to win We are 
 going to win because Americans across this country believe in the same basic dream 
 Last week I visited Elmore Minnesota the small town where Fritz Mondale was raised And 
 soon Fritz and Joan will visit our family in Queens Nine hundred people live in Elmore In 
 Queens there are 2,000 people on one block You would think we 'd be different but we 're 
 not Children walk to school in Elmore past grain elevators in Queens they pass by subway 
 stops But no matter where they live their future depends on education and their parents 
 are willing to do their part to make those schools as good as they can be In Elmore there are 
 family farms in Queens small businesses But the men and women who run them all take 
 pride in supporting their families through hard work and initiative On the 4th of July in 
 Elmore they hang flags out on Main Street in Queens they fly them over Grand Avenue But 
 all of us love our country and stand ready to defend the freedom that it represents 
 Americans want to   But under this administration the rules are 
 rigged against too many of our people It is n't right that every year the share of taxes paid by 
 individual citizens is going up while the share   is getting smaller 
 and smaller The rules say Everyone in our society should contribute their fair share 
  
  
 
                          
       
 It is n't right that this year Ronald Reagan will hand the American people a bill for interest on 
 the national debt larger than the entire cost of the federal government under John F. 
 Kennedy Our parents left us a growing economy The rules say We must not leave our kids a 
 mountain of debt 
 It is n't right that a woman should get paid 59 cents on the dollar for the same work as a man 
 If you you deserve a fair day 's pay for a fair day 's work It is n't right that if 
 trends  2000 nearly all of the poor people in America will be women and 
 children The rules of a decent society say When you distribute sacrifice in times of austerity 
 you do n't put women and children first It is n't right that young people today fear they wo n't 
 get the Social Security they paid for and that older Americans fear that they will lose what 
 they have already learned earned Social Security is a contract between the last generation 
 and the next and the rules say You do n't break contracts 
 We are going to keep faith with older Americans We hammered out a fair compromise in the 
 Congress to save Social Security Every group sacrificed to keep the system sound It is time 
 Ronald Reagan stopped scaring our senior citizens 
 It is n't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 
 nuclear warheads That is n't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two 
 centuries And our future does n't have to be that way Change is in the air just as surely as 
 when John Kennedy beckoned America to a new frontier when Sally Ride rocketed into space 
 and when Reverend Jesse Jackson ran for the office of President of the United States 
 By choosing a woman to run for our nation 's second highest office you send a powerful signal 
 to all Americans There are no doors we can not unlock We will place no limits on 
 achievement If we can do this we can do anything 
 Tonight we reclaim our dream We 're going to make the rules of American life work fairly for 
 all Americans again To an Administration that would have us debate all over again whether 
 the Voting Rights Act should be renewed and whether segregated schools should be tax 
 exempt we say Mr. President Those debates are over On the issue of civil rights voting 
 rights and affirmative action for minorities we must not go backwards We must and we 
 will move forward to open the doors of opportunity 
  
  
 
                          
       
 To those who understand that our country can not prosper unless we draw on the talents of all 
 Americans we say We will pass the Equal Rights Amendment 
 The issue is not what America can do for women but what women can do for America 
 To the Americans who will lead our country into the 21st century we say We will not have a 
 Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the 19th century 
 To those concerned about the strength of American and family values as I am I say We are 
 going to restore those values love caring  not excluding 
 those whose beliefs differ from our own Because our own faith is strong we will fight to 
 preserve the freedom of faith for others 
 To those working Americans who fear that banks utilities and large special interests have a 
 lock on the White House we say Join us let 's elect the people 's President and let 's have 
  the American people again 
 To an Administration that would savage student loans and education at the dawn of a new 
 technological age we say You fit the classic definition of a cynic you know the price of 
 everything but the value of nothing 
 To our students and their parents we say We will insist on the highest standards of 
 excellence because the jobs of the future require skilled minds To young Americans who may 
 be called to our country 's service we say We know your generation will proudly answer our 
 country 's call as each generation before you 
 This past year we remembered the bravery and sacrifice of Americans at Normandy And we 
 finally paid tribute as we should have done years ago to that Unknown Soldier who 
 represents all the brave young Americans who died in Vietnam Let no one doubt we will 
 defend America 's security and the cause of freedom around the world But we want a 
 President who tells us what America 's fighting for not just what we are fighting against 
 
  
  
 
                          
       
 We want a President who will defend human rights not just where it is convenient but 
 wherever freedom is at risk from Chile to Afghanistan from Poland to South Africa To 
 those who have watched this administration 's confusion in the Middle East as it has tilted first 
 toward one and then another of Israel 's long time enemies and wonder Will America stand 
 by her friends and sister democracy we say America knows who her friends are in the 
 Middle East and around the world America will stand with Israel always 
 Finally we want a President who will keep America strong but use that strength to keep 
 America and the world at peace A nuclear freeze is not a slogan It is a tool for survival in the 
 nuclear age If we leave our children nothing else let us leave them this Earth as we found it 
 whole and green and full of life 
 I know in my heart that Walter Mondale will be that President 
 A wise man once said Every one of us is given the gift of life and what a strange gift it is If 
 it is preserved jealously and selfishly it impoverishes and saddens But if it is spent for 
 others it enriches and beautifies My fellow Americans We can debate policies and 
 programs but in the end what separates the two parties in this election campaign is whether 
 we use the gift of life for others or only ourselves 
 Tonight my husband John and our three children are in this hall with me To my daughters 
 Donna and Laura and my son John Junior I say My mother did not break faith with me and 
 I will not break faith with you 
 To all the children of America I say The generation before ours kept faith with us and like 
 them we will pass on to you a stronger more just America

5,Eleanor Roosevelt,On the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1948," 
 
 
 Mr. President fellow delegates 
 The long and meticulous study and debate of which this Universal Declaration of Human 
 Rights is the product means that it reflects the composite views of the many men and 
 governments who have contributed to its formulation Not every man nor every government 
 can have what he wants in a document of this kind There are of course particular provisions 
 in the Declaration before us with which we are not fully satisfied I have no doubt this is true 
 of other delegations and it would still be true if we continued our labors over many years 
 Taken as a whole the Delegation of the United States believes that this is a good document 
 even a great document and we propose to give it our full support The position of the 
 United States on the various parts of the Declaration is a matter of record in the Third 
 Committee I shall not burden the Assembly and particularly my colleagues of the Third 
 Committee with a restatement of that position here 
 I should like to comment briefly on the amendments   delegation The 
 language of these amendments has been dressed up somewhat but the substance is the 
 same as the amendments which were   delegation in committee and 
 rejected after exhaustive discussion Substantially the same amendments have been 
 previously considered and rejected in the Human Rights Commission 
  
  
 
                         
       
 We in the United States admire those who fight for their convictions and the Soviet 
 delegation has fought for their convictions But in the older democracies we have learned that 
 sometimes we bow to the will of the majority In doing that we do not give up our 
 convictions We continue sometimes to persuade and eventually we may be successful But 
 we know that we have to work together and we have to progress So we believe that when 
 we have made a good fight and the majority is against us it is perhaps better tactics to try to 
 cooperate  
 I feel bound to say that I think perhaps it is somewhat of an imposition on this Assembly to 
 have these amendments offered again here and I am confident that they will be rejected 
 without debate  
 The first two paragraphs of the amendment to article 3 deal with the question of minorities 
 which committee 3 decided required further study and has recommended in a separate 
 resolution their reference to the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights 
 Commission As set out in the Soviet amendment this provision clearly states group and 
 not individual rights  
 The Soviet amendment to article 20 is obviously a very restrictive statement of the right to 
 freedom of opinion and expression It sets up standards which would enable any state 
 practically to deny all freedom of opinion and expression without violating the article It 
 introduces the terms democratic view democratic systems democratic state and 
 fascism which we know all too well from debates in this Assembly over the past two years 
 on warmongering and related subjects are liable to the most flagrant abuse and diverse 
 interpretations 
 The statement of the Soviet delegate here tonight is a very good case in point on this The 
 Soviet amendment of article 22 introduces new elements into the article without improving 
 the committed text and again introduces specific reference to discrimination As was 
 repeatedly pointed out in committee 3 the question of discrimination is comprehensively 
 covered in article 2 of the Declaration so that its restatement elsewhere is completely 
 unnecessary and also has the effect of weakening the comprehensive principles stated in 
 article 2 The new article   delegation is but a restatement of State 
 obligation which the Soviet delegation attempted to introduce into practically every article in 
 the Declaration It would convert the Declaration into a document stating obligations on 
 states thereby changing completely its character as a statement of principles to serve as a 
 common standard of achievement for the members of the United Nations  
  
  
 
                         
       
 The Soviet proposal for deferring consideration of the Declaration to the 4th session of the 
 Assembly requires no comment An identical text was rejected in committee 3 by a vote of 6 
 in favor and 26 against We are all agreed I am sure that the Declaration which has been 
 worked on with such great effort and devotion and over such a long period of time must be 
 
 Certain provisions of the Declaration are stated in such broad terms as to be acceptable only 
 because of the provisions in article 30 providing for limitation on the exercise of the rights for 
 the purpose of meeting the requirements of morality public order and the general welfare 
 An example of this is the provision that everyone has the right to equal access to the public 
 service in his country The basic principle of equality and of nondiscrimination as to public 
 employment is sound but it can not be accepted without limitation My government for 
 example would consider that this is unquestionably subject to limitation in the interest of 
 public order and the general welfare It would not consider that the exclusion from public 
 employment of persons holding subversive political beliefs and not loyal to the basic principles 
 and practices of the constitution and laws of the country would in any way infringe upon this 
 right 
 Likewise my government has made it clear in the course of the development of the 
 Declaration that it does not consider that the economic and social and cultural rights stated in 
 the Declaration imply an obligation on governments to assure the enjoyment of these rights 
 by direct governmental action This was made quite clear in the Human Rights Commission 
 text of article 23 which served as a so called umbrella article to the articles on economic and 
 social rights We consider that the principle has not been   that this article 
 no longer contains a reference to the articles which follow it This in no way affects our whole- 
 hearted support for the basic principles of economic social and cultural rights set forth in 
 these articles 
 In giving our approval to the Declaration today it is of primary importance that we keep 
 clearly in mind the basic character of the document It is not a treaty it is not an international 
 agreement It is not and does not purport to be a statement of law or of legal obligation It is 
 a Declaration of basic principles of human rights and freedoms to be stamped with the 
 approval of the General   of its members and to serve as a common 
 standard of achievement for all peoples of all nations 
 
  
  
 
                         
       
 We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life of the United Nations and in 
 the life of mankind This Universal Declaration of Human Rights may well become the 
 international Magna Carta of all men everywhere We hope its  
 Assembly will be an event comparable to the proclamation of the Declaration of the Rights of 
  people in 1789 the adoption of the Bill of   of the 
 United States and the adoption of comparable declarations at different times in other 
 countries 
 At a time when there are so many issues on which we find it difficult to reach a common basis 
 of agreement it is a significant fact that 58 states have found such a large measure of 
 agreement in the complex field of human rights This must be taken as testimony of our 
 common aspiration first voiced in the Charter of the United Nations to lift men everywhere to 
 a higher standard of life and to a greater enjoyment of freedom Man ’s desire for peace lies 
 behind this Declaration The realization that the flagrant violation of human  
 Fascist countries sowed the seeds of the last world war has supplied the impetus for the work 
 which brings us to the moment of achievement here today 
 In a recent speech in Canada Gladstone Murray said 
 The central fact is that man is fundamentally a moral being that the light we have is 
 imperfect does not matter so long as we are always trying to improve it we are equal 
 in sharing the moral freedom that distinguishes us as men Man ’s status makes each 
 individual an end in himself No man   the servant of the state or of 
 another man the ideal and fact of freedom and not technology are the true 
 distinguishing marks of our civilization  
 This Declaration is based upon the spiritual fact that man must have freedom in which to 
 develop his full stature and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity We 
 have much to do to fully achieve and to assure the rights set forth in this Declaration But 
 having them put before us with the moral backing of 58 nations will be a great step forward 
 As we here bring to fruition our labors on this Declaration of Human Rights we must at the 
 same time rededicate ourselves to the unfinished task which lies before us We can now move 
 on with new courage and inspiration to the completion of an international covenant on human 
 rights and of measures for the implementation of human rights 
 
  
  
 
                         
       
 In conclusion I feel that I can not do better than to repeat the call to action by Secretary 
 Marshall in his opening statement to this Assembly  
 Let this third regular session of the General Assembly  
 majority the Declaration of Human Rights as a standard of conduct for all and let us 
 as Members of the United Nations conscious of our own short comings and 
 imperfections join our effort in good faith to live up to this high standard",0.0744784176349639,0.0977004840970039,0.0619170889258384,0.2256025075912475,0.4768464267253876,0.0542596951127052,0.0091954246163368,0.1235757739735012,0.3498542261610444,32.25065291563277,0.302158273381295,0.011808910359634998,0.056303549571603426,0.06728538283062645,31.05,1.0
6,Dwight Eisenhower,Farewell Address,1961," 
 
 
 Good evening my fellow Americans 
 First I should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the 
 opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation 
 My special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening 
 Three days from now after half century in the service of our country I shall lay down the 
 responsibilities of office as in traditional and solemn ceremony the authority of the 
 Presidency is vested in my successor This evening I come to you with a message of leave- 
 taking and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you my countrymen 
 Like every other Like every other citizen I wish the new President and all who will labor 
 with him Godspeed I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity 
 for all 
  
  
 
                                       
 Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on issues of 
 great moment the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation My own 
 relations with the Congress which began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a 
 member of the Senate appointed me to West Point have since ranged to the intimate during 
 the war and immediate post war period and finally to the mutually interdependent during 
 these past eight years In this final relationship the Congress and the Administration have on 
 most vital issues cooperated well to serve the nation good rather than mere partisanship 
 and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward So my official 
 relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling on my part of gratitude that we have 
 been able to do so much together 
 We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars 
 among great nations Three of these involved our own country Despite these holocausts 
 America is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world 
 Understandably proud of this pre eminence we yet realize that America 's leadership and 
 prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military 
 strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human 
 betterment 
 Throughout America 's adventure in free government our basic purposes have been to keep 
 the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and 
 integrity among peoples and among nations To strive for less would be unworthy of a free 
 and religious people Any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or 
 readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad 
 Progress toward these noble goals is persistently   now engulfing the 
 world It commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings We face a hostile ideology 
 global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insiduous insidious in 
 method Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration To meet it 
 successfully there is called for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis 
 but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the 
 burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake Only thus shall we 
 remain despite every provocation on our charted course toward permanent peace and 
 human betterment 
  
  
 
                                       
 Crises there will continue to be In meeting them whether foreign or domestic great or small 
 there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become 
 the miraculous solution to all current difficulties A huge increase in newer elements of our 
 defenses development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic 
 expansion in basic and applied research these and many other possibilities each possibly 
 promising in itself may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel 
 But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to 
 maintain balance in and among national programs balance between the private and the public 
 economy balance between the cost and hoped for advantages balance between the clearly 
 necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between our essential requirements as a 
 nation and the duties   upon the individual balance between actions of 
 the moment and the national welfare of the future Good judgment seeks balance and 
 progress Lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration The record of many decades 
 stands as proof that our people and their Government have in the main understood these 
 truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress 
 But threats new in kind or degree constantly arise Of these I mention two only  
 A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment Our arms must be mighty 
 ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own 
 destruction Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my 
 predecessors in peacetime or  men of World War II or Korea 
 Until the latest of our world conflicts the United States had no armaments industry American 
 makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well But we can no 
 longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense We have been compelled to create a 
 permanent armaments industry of vast proportions Added to this three and a half million 
 men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment We annually spend on 
 military security alone more than the net income of all United States cooperations 
 corporations 
 
  
  
 
                                       
 Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new 
 in the American experience The total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in 
 every city every Statehouse every office of the Federal government We recognize the 
 imperative need for this development Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave 
 implications Our toil resources and livelihood are all involved So is the very structure of our 
 society 
 In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted 
 influence whether sought or  industrial complex The potential for 
 the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist We must never let the weight of 
 this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes We should take nothing for 
 granted Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the 
 huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so 
 that security and liberty may prosper together 
 Akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial military posture 
 has been the technological revolution during recent decades In this revolution research has 
 become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly A steadily increasing 
 share is conducted  the direction of the Federal government 
 Today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been   of 
 scientists in laboratories and testing fields In the same fashion the free university 
 historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a 
 revolution in the conduct of research Partly because of the huge costs involved a 
 government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity For every old 
 blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers The prospect of domination 
 of the nation 's project allocations and the power of money 
 is ever present and is gravely to be regarded 
 Yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be 
 alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a 
 scientific technological elite  
  
  
 
                                       
 It is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces 
 new and old within the principles of our democratic system ever aiming toward the 
 supreme goals of our free society  
 Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time As we peer into society 's 
 future we you and I and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today 
 plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow We can not 
 mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their 
 political and spiritual heritage We want democracy to survive for all generations to come not 
 to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow  
 During the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that this world of ours 
 ever growing smaller must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate and be 
 instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect Such a confederation must be one 
 of equals The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do 
 we protected as we economic and military strength That table though 
  frustrations past frustrations can not be abandoned for the certain 
 agony of disarmament of the battlefield 
 Disarmament with mutual honor and confidence is a continuing imperative Together we 
 must learn how to compose differences not with arms but with intellect and decent purpose 
 Because this need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official 
 responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment As one who has witnessed 
 the horror and the lingering sadness of war as one who knows that another war could utterly 
 destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years I 
 wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight 
 Happily I can say that war has been avoided Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has 
 been made But so much remains to be done As a private citizen I shall never cease to do 
 what little I can to help the world advance along that road 
 So in this my last good night to you as your President I thank you for the many 
 opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace I trust in that in 
 that in that service you find some things worthy As for the rest of it I know you will find 
 ways to improve performance in the future 
  
  
 
                                       
 You and I my fellow citizens need to be strong in our faith that all nations under God will 
 reach the goal of peace with justice May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle 
 confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the Nations great goals 
 To all the peoples of the world I once more give expression to America 's prayerful and 
 continuing aspiration We pray that peoples of all faiths all races all nations may have their 
 great human needs satisfied that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the 
 full that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings Those who 
 have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibility that all who are insensitive to the 
 needs of others will learn charity and that the sources scourges of poverty disease and 
 ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth and that in the goodness of time all 
 peoples will come to live together in a peace   force of mutual 
 respect and love 
 Now on Friday noon I am to become a private citizen I am proud to do so I look forward to 
 it

7,Mary M. Fisher,A Whisper of AIDS,1992," 
 
 
 Less than three months ago at platform hearings in Salt Lake City I asked the Republican 
 Party to lift the shroud of silence which has been draped over the issue of HIV and AIDS I 
 have come tonight to bring our silence to an end I bear a message of challenge not self- 
 congratulation I want your attention not your applause 
 I would never have asked to be HIV positive but I believe that in all things there is a purpose 
 and I stand before you and before the nation gladly The reality of AIDS is brutally clear Two 
 hundred thousand Americans are dead or dying A million more are infected Worldwide forty 
 million sixty million or a hundred million infections will be counted in the coming few years 
 But despite science and research White House meetings and congressional hearings despite 
 good intentions and bold initiatives campaign slogans and hopeful promises it is despite it 
 all the epidemic which is winning tonight 
 In the context of an election year I ask you here in this great hall or listening in the quiet of 
 your home to recognize that AIDS virus is not a political creature It does not care whether 
 you are Democrat or Republican it does not ask whether you are black or white male or 
 female gay or straight young or old 
  
  
 
                  
 Tonight I represent an AIDS community whose members have been reluctantly drafted from 
 every segment of American society Though I am white and a mother I am one with a black 
 infant struggling with tubes in a Philadelphia hospital Though I am female and contracted this 
 disease in marriage and enjoy the warm support of my family I am one with the lonely gay 
 man sheltering a flickering candle from the cold wind of his family ’s rejection 
 This is not a distant threat It is a present danger The rate of infection is increasing fastest 
 among women and children Largely unknown a decade ago AIDS is the third leading killer of 
 young adult Americans today But it wo n’t be third for long because unlike other diseases 
 this one travels Adolescents do n’t give each other cancer or heart disease because they 
 believe they are in love but HIV is different and we have helped it along We have killed each 
 other with our ignorance our prejudice and our silence 
 We may take refuge in our stereotypes but we can not hide there long because HIV asks only 
 one thing of those it attacks Are you human And this is the right question Are you human 
 Because people with HIV have not entered some alien state of being They are human They 
 have not earned cruelty and they do not deserve meanness They do n’t benefit from being 
 isolated or treated as outcasts Each of them is exactly what God made a person not evil 
 deserving of our judgment not victims longing for our pity people ready for support and 
 worthy of compassion 
 My call to you my Party is to take a public stand no less compassionate than that of the 
 President and Mrs. Bush They have embraced me and my family in memorable ways In the 
 place of judgment they have shown affection In difficult moments they have raised our 
 spirits In the darkest hours I have seen them reaching not only to me but also to my 
 parents armed with that stunning grief and special grace that comes only to parents who 
 have themselves leaned too long over the bedside of a dying child 
 With the President ’s leadership much good has been done Much of the good has gone 
 unheralded and as the President has insisted much remains to be done But we do the 
 President ’s cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a virus that destroys it 
 We must be consistent if we are to be believed We can not love justice and ignore prejudice 
 love our children and fear to teach them Whatever our role as parent or policymaker we 
 must act as eloquently as we speak else we have no integrity My call to the nation is a plea 
 for awareness If you believe you are safe you are in danger Because I was not hemophiliac 
 I was not at risk Because I was not gay I was not at risk Because I did not inject drugs I 
 was not at risk 
  
  
 
                  
 My father has devoted much of his lifetime guarding against another holocaust He is part of 
 the generation who heard Pastor Nemoellor come out of the Nazi death camps to say  
 They came after the Jews and I was not a Jew so I did not protest They came after 
 the trade unionists and I was not a trade unionist so I did not protest Then they 
 came after the Roman Catholics and I was not a Roman Catholic so I did not protest 
 Then they came after me and there was no one left to protest 
 The The lesson history teaches is this If you believe you are safe you are at risk If you do 
 not see this killer stalking your children look again There is no family or community no race 
 or religion no place left in America that is safe Until we genuinely embrace this message we 
 are a nation at risk  
 Tonight HIV marches resolutely toward AIDS in more than a million American homes littering 
 its pathway with the bodies of the young young men young women young parents and 
 young children One of the families is mine If it is true that HIV inevitably turns to AIDS then 
 my children will inevitably turn to orphans My family has been a rock of support 
 My 84 year old father who has pursued the healing of the nations will not accept the premise 
 that he can not heal his daughter My mother refuses to be broken She still calls at midnight 
 to tell wonderful jokes that make me laugh Sisters and friends and my brother Phillip whose 
 birthday is today all have helped carry me over the hardest places I am blessed richly and 
 deeply blessed to have such a family 
 But not all of you But not all of you have been so blessed You are HIV positive but dare 
 not say it You have lost loved ones but you dare not whisper the word AIDS You weep 
 silently You grieve alone I have a message for you It is not you who should feel shame It is 
 we we who tolerate ignorance and practice prejudice we who have taught you to fear We 
 must lift our shroud of silence making it safe for you to reach out for compassion It is our 
 task to seek safety for our children not in quiet denial but in effective action 
 Someday our children will be grown My son Max now four will take the measure of his 
 mother My son Zachary now two will sort through his memories I may not be here to hear 
 their judgments but I know already what I hope they are I want my children to know that 
 their mother was not a victim She was a messenger I do not want them to think as I once 
 did that courage is the absence of fear I want them to know that courage is the strength to 
 act wisely when most we are afraid I want them to have the courage to step forward when 
  or their Party and give leadership no matter what the personal cost 
  
  
 
                  
 I ask no more of you than I ask of myself or of my children To the millions of you who are 
 grieving who are frightened who have suffered the ravages of AIDS firsthand Have courage 
 and you will find support To the millions who are strong I issue the plea Set aside prejudice 
 and politics to make room for compassion and sound policy 
 To my children I make this pledge I will not give in Zachary because I draw my courage 
 from you Your silly giggle gives me hope your gentle prayers give me strength and you my 
 child give me the reason to say to America You are at risk And I will not rest Max until I 
 have done all I can to make your world safe I will seek a place where intimacy is not the 
 prelude to suffering I will not hurry to leave you my children but when I go I pray that you 
 will not suffer shame on my account 
 To all within the sound of my voice I appeal Learn with me the lessons of history and of 
 grace so my children will not be afraid to say the word AIDS when I am gone Then their 
 children and yours may not need to whisper it at all 
 God bless the children and God bless us all

8,Barbara Jordan,Democratic National Convention Keynote Address,1976," 
 
 
 Thank you ladies and gentlemen for a very warm reception 
 It was one hundred and forty four years ago that members of the Democratic Party first met 
 in convention to select a Presidential candidate Since that time Democrats have continued to 
 convene once every four years and draft a party platform and nominate a Presidential 
 candidate And our meeting this week is a continuation of that tradition But there is 
 something different about tonight There is something special about tonight What is different 
 What is special  
 I Barbara Jordan am a keynote speaker 
 When A lot of years passed since 1832 and during that time it would have been most 
 unusual for any national political party to ask a Barbara Jordan to deliver a keynote address 
 But tonight here I am And I feel I feel that notwithstanding the past that my presence 
 here is one additional bit of evidence that the American Dream need not forever be deferred 
  
  
 
                          
       
 Now Now that I have this grand distinction what in the world am I supposed to say I could 
 easily spend this time praising the accomplishments of this party and attacking the 
 Republicans but I do n't choose to do that I could list the many problems which Americans 
 have I could list the problems which cause people to feel cynical angry frustrated problems 
 which include lack of integrity in government the feeling that the individual no longer counts 
 the reality of material and spiritual poverty the feeling that the grand American experiment is 
 failing or has failed I could recite these problems and then I could sit down and offer no 
 solutions But I do n't choose to do that either The citizens of America expect more They 
 deserve and they want more than a recital of problems 
 We are a people in a quandary about the present We are a people in search of our future We 
 are a people in search of a national community We are a people trying not only to solve the 
 problems of the present unemployment inflation but we are attempting on a larger scale to 
 fulfill the promise of America We are attempting to fulfill our national purpose to create and 
 sustain a society in which all of us are equal 
 Throughout Throughout our history when people have looked for new ways to solve their 
 problems and to uphold the principles of this nation many times they have turned to political 
 parties They have often turned to the Democratic Party What is it What is it about the 
 Democratic Party that makes it the instrument the people use when they search for ways to 
 shape their future Well I believe the answer to that question lies in our concept of governing 
 Our concept of governing is derived from our view of people It is a concept deeply rooted in a 
 set of beliefs firmly etched in the national conscience of all of us 
 Now what are these beliefs First we believe in equality for all and privileges for none This is 
 a belief This is a belief that each American regardless of background has equal standing in 
 the public forum all of us Because Because we believe this idea so firmly we are an 
 inclusive rather than an exclusive party Let everybody come 
 I think it no accident that most of those immigrating to America in the 19th century identified 
 with the Democratic Party We are a heterogeneous party made up of Americans of diverse 
 backgrounds We believe that the people are the source of all governmental power that the 
 authority of the people is to be extended not restricted 
  
  
 
                          
       
 This This can be accomplished   citizen with every opportunity to 
 participate in the management of the government They must have that we believe We 
 believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people not just one 
 interest group but all the people has an obligation to actively underscore actively seek 
 to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement obstacles emanating 
 from race sex economic condition The government must remove them seek to remove 
 them 
 We We are a party We are a party of innovation We do not reject our traditions but we 
 are willing to adapt to changing circumstances when change we must We are willing to suffer 
 the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future We have a positive vision of the 
 future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of America can one 
 day be finally closed We believe that 
 This my friends is the bedrock of our concept of governing This is a part of the reason why 
 Americans have turned to the Democratic Party These are the foundations upon which a 
 national community can be built Let all understand that these guiding principles can not be 
 discarded for short term political gains They represent what this country is all about They 
 are indigenous to the American idea And these are principles which are not negotiable 
 In other times In other times I could stand here and give this kind of exposition on the 
 beliefs of the Democratic Party and that would be enough But today that is not enough 
 People want more That is not sufficient reason for the majority of the people of this country 
 to decide to vote Democratic We have made mistakes We realize that We admit our 
 mistakes In our haste to do all things for all people we did not foresee the full consequences 
 of our actions And when the people raised their voices we did n't hear But our deafness was 
 only a temporary condition and not an irreversible condition 
 Even as I stand here and admit that we have made mistakes I still believe that as the people 
 of America sit in judgment on each party they will recognize that our mistakes were mistakes 
 of the heart They 'll recognize that 
 
  
  
 
                          
       
 And now now we must look to the future Let us heed the voice of the people and recognize 
 their common sense If we do not we not only blaspheme our political heritage we ignore the 
 common ties that bind all Americans Many fear the future Many are distrustful of their 
 leaders and believe that their voices are never heard Many seek only to satisfy their private 
 work wants to satisfy their private interests But this is the great danger America faces 
 that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups city 
 against suburb region against region individual against individual each seeking to satisfy 
 private wants If that happens who then will speak for America Who then will speak for the 
 common good 
 This is the question which must be answered in 1976 Are we to be one people bound 
 sharing in a common endeavor or will we become a divided 
 nation For all of its uncertainty we can not flee the future We must not become the New 
 Puritans and reject our society We must address and master the future together It can be 
 done if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community that we share a 
 common national endeavor It can be done 
 There is no executive order there is no law that can require the American people to form a 
 national community This we must do as individuals and if we do it as individuals there is no 
 President of the United States who can veto that decision 
 As a first step As a first step we must restore our belief in ourselves We are a generous 
 people so why ca n't we be generous with each other We need to take to heart the words 
 
 Let us restore the social intercourse Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and 
 that affection without which liberty and even life are but dreary things 
 A nation is   of each of us to share in the responsibility for upholding 
 the common good A government is invigorated when each one of us is willing to participate in 
 shaping the future of this nation In this election year we must define the common good 
 and begin again to shape a common future Let each person do his or her part If one citizen 
 is unwilling to participate all of us are going to suffer For the American idea though it is 
  us is realized in each one of us 
  
  
 
                          
       
 And now what are those of us who are elected public officials supposed to do We call 
 ourselves public servants but I 'll tell you this We as public servants must set an example 
 for the rest of the nation It is hypocritical for the public official to admonish and exhort the 
 people to uphold the common good if we are derelict in upholding the common good More is 
 required More is required of public officials than slogans and handshakes and press 
 releases More is required We must hold ourselves strictly accountable We must provide the 
 people with a vision of the future 
 If we promise as public officials we must deliver If If we as public officials propose we 
 must produce If we say to the American people It is time for you to be sacrificial 
 sacrifice If the public official says that we public officials must be the first to give We must 
 be And again if we make mistakes we must be willing to admit them We have to do that 
 What we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do 
 everything and the idea the belief that government ought to do nothing Strike a balance 
 Let there be no illusions about the difficulty of forming this kind of a national community It 's 
 tough difficult not easy But a spirit of harmony will survive in America only if each of us 
 remembers that we share a common destiny if each of us remembers when self interest and 
 bitterness seem to prevail that we share a common destiny 
 I have confidence that we can form this kind of national community 
 I have confidence that the Democratic Party can lead the way 
 I have that confidence 
 We can not improve on the system of government handed down to   of the 
 Republic There is no way to improve upon that But what we can do is to find new ways to 
 implement that system and realize our destiny 
 Now I began this   you on the uniqueness of a Barbara Jordan 
 making a keynote address Well I am going to close my   Republican 
 President and I ask you that as you listen to these words of Abraham Lincoln relate them to 
 the concept of a national community in which every last one of us participates 
  
  
 
                          
       
 As I would not be a slave so I would not be a master This This This expresses my 
 idea of Democracy Whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no 
 Democracy

9,Eugene Debs,Statement to the Court,1918," 
 
 Your Honor years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings and I made up my mind 
 that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth I said then and I say now that while 
 there is a lower class I am in it and while there is a criminal element I am of it and while 
 there is a soul in prison I am not free  
 
 I listened to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this prosecution but 
 my mind remains unchanged I look upon the Espionage Law as a despotic enactment in 
 flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the spirit of free institutions 
 
 Your Honor I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the social system in which we 
 live that I believe in a fundamental change but if   orderly 
 means 
 
 Standing here this morning I recall my boyhood At fourteen I went to work in a railroad 
 shop at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad I remember all the hardships and 
 privations of that earlier day and from that time until now my heart has been with the 
 working class I could have been in Congress long ago I have preferred to go to prison 
  
  
 
                                                                             
                                                                         
                                                                         
                                                                          
       
 
 I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and the factories of the men in the mines 
 and on the railroads 
 I am thinking of the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren 
 lives of the little children who in this system are robbed of their childhood and in their tender 
 years are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon and forced into the industrial dungeons 
 there to feed the monster machines while they themselves are being starved and stunted 
 body and soul I see them dwarfed and diseased and their little lives broken and blasted 
 because in this high noon of Christian civilization money is still so much more important than 
 the flesh and blood of childhood In very truth gold is god today and rules with pitiless sway in 
 the affairs of men  
 
 In this country the most favored beneath the bending skies we have vast areas of the 
 richest and most fertile soil material resources in inexhaustible abundance the most 
 marvelous productive machinery on earth and millions of eager workers ready to apply their 
 labor to that machinery to produce in abundance for every man woman and child and if 
 there are still vast numbers of our people who are the victims of poverty and whose lives are 
 an unceasing struggle all the way from youth to old age until at last death comes to their 
 rescue and lulls these hapless victims to dreamless sleep it is not the fault of the Almighty it 
 can not be charged to nature but it is due entirely to the outgrown social system in which we 
 live that ought to be abolished not only in the interest of the toiling masses but in the higher 
 interest of all humanity 
 
 I believe Your Honor in common with all Socialists that this nation ought to own and control 
 its own industries I believe as all Socialists do that all things that are jointly needed and 
 used ought to be jointly owned that industry the basis of our social life instead of being 
 the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment ought to be the common 
 property of all democratically administered in the interest of all 
 
 I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing 
 that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars while millions of men and 
 women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence  
 
 This order of things can not always endure I have registered my protest against it I recognize 
 the feebleness of my effort but fortunately I am not alone 
  
  
 
                                                                             
                                                                         
                                                                         
                                                                          
       
 There are multiplied thousands of others who like myself have come to realize that before we 
 may truly enjoy the blessings of civilized life we must reorganize society upon a mutual and 
 cooperative basis and to this end we have organized a great economic and political 
 movement that spreads over the face of all the earth  
 
 There are today upwards of sixty millions of Socialists loyal devoted adherents to this cause 
 regardless of nationality race creed color or sex They are all making common cause They 
 are spreading with tireless energy the propaganda of the new social order They are waiting 
 watching and working hopefully through all the hours of the day and the night They are still 
 in a minority But they have learned how to be patient and to bide their time 
 They feel they know indeed that the time is coming in spite of all opposition all 
 persecution when this emancipating gospel will spread among all the peoples and when this 
 minority will become the triumphant majority and sweeping into power inaugurate the 
 greatest social and economic change in history  
 
 In that day we shall have the universal commonwealth the harmonious cooperation of every 
 nation with every other nation on earth 
 
 Your Honor I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity I realize that finally the right must 
 prevail I never so clearly comprehended as now the great struggle between the powers of 
 greed and exploitation on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of industrial 
 freedom and social justice  
 
 I can see the dawn of the better day for humanity The people are awakening In due time 
 they will and must come to their own  
 
 When the mariner sailing over tropic seas looks for relief from his weary watch he turns his 
 eyes toward the southern cross burning luridly above the tempest vexed ocean As the 
 midnight approaches the southern cross begins to bend the whirling worlds change their 
 places and with starry fingerpoints the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of 
 the universe and though no bell may beat the glad tidings the lookout knows that the 
 midnight is passing and that relief and rest are close at hand Let the people everywhere take 
 heart of hope for the cross is bending the midnight is passing and joy cometh with the 
 morning

10,Robert F. Kennedy,Day of Affirmation Address at Cape Town University1,1966," 
 
 
 Mr. Chancellor Mr. Vice Chancellor Professor Robertson Mr. Diamond Mr. Daniel and Ladies 
 and Gentlemen 
 I come here this evening because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the 
 Dutch in the mid seventeenth century then taken and at last 
 independent a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued but relations with 
 whom remain a problem to this day a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier a land 
 which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern 
 technology a land which once the importer of slaves and now must struggle to wipe out the 
 last traces of that former bondage I refer of course to the United States of America  
  
  
 
                                                                    
 But I am glad to come here and my wife and I and all of our party are glad to come here to 
 South Africa and we 're glad to come to Cape Town I am already greatly enjoying my stay 
 and my visit here I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people of all walks 
 of life and all segments of South African opinion including those who represent the views of 
 the government 
 Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students For a decade 
 NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
 principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the globe Your 
 work at home and in international student affairs has brought great credit to yourselves and 
 to your country I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a 
 particularly close relationship with this organization 
 And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson who first extended the invitation on behalf 
 of NUSAS I wish to thank him for his kindness to me in inviting me I am very sorry that he 
 can not be with us here this evening I was happy to have had the opportunity to meet and 
 speak with him earlier this evening And I presented him with a copy of Profiles in Courage 
 which was a book that was   Kennedy and was signed to him by 
 President Kennedy 's widow Mrs. John Kennedy 
 This is a Day of Affirmation a celebration of liberty We stand here in the name of freedom At 
 the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man the 
 child of God is the touchstone of value and all society all groups and states exist for that 
 person 's benefit Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be 
 the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society 
 The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech the right to express and 
 communicate ideas to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest the right to 
 recall governments to their duties and to their   obligations above all the right to affirm one 's 
 membership and allegiance to the body politic to society to the men with whom we share 
 our land our heritage and our children 's future 
 Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard to share in the decisions of 
 government which shape men 's lives Everything that makes man 's life worthwhile family 
 work education a place to rear one 's children and a place to rest one 's head all this 
 depends on the decisions of government all can be swept   which does 
 not heed the demands of its people and I mean all of its people Therefore the essential 
 humanity of man can be protected and preserved only where government must answer not 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 just to the wealthy not just to those of a particular religion not just to those of a particular 
 race but to all of the people 
 And even   of the governed as in our own Constitution must be 
 limited in its power to act against its people so that there may be no interference with the 
 right to worship but also no interference with the security of the home no arbitrary 
 imposition of pains or penalties on an ordinary   or low no restriction on 
 the freedom of men to seek education or to seek work or opportunity of any kind so that 
 each man may become all that he is capable of becoming 
 These These are the sacred rights of Western society These were the essential differences 
 between us and Nazi Germany as they were between Athens and Persia 
 They are the essence of our differences with communism today I am unalterably opposed to 
 communism because it exalts the State over the individual and over the family and because 
 its system contains a lack of freedom of speech of protest of religion and of the press which 
 is characteristic of a totalitarian regime The way of opposition to communism however is not 
 to imitate its dictatorship but to enlarge individual human freedoms There are those in every 
 land who would label as Communist every threat to their privilege But may I say to you as I 
 have seen on my travels in all sections of the world reform is not communism And the denial 
 of freedom in whatever name only strengthens the very communism it claims to oppose 
 Many nations have set forth their own definitions and declarations of these principles And 
 there have often been wide and tragic gaps between promise and performance ideal and 
 reality Yet the great ideals have constantly recalled us to our own duties And with painful 
 slowness we in the United States have extended and enlarged the meaning and the practice 
 of freedom to all of our people 
 For two centuries my own country has struggled to overcome the self imposed handicap of 
 prejudice and discrimination based on nationality on social class or race discrimination 
 profoundly repugnant to the theory and to the command of our Constitution Even as my 
 father grew up in Boston Massachusetts signs told him No Irish Need Apply Two 
 generations later President Kennedy became the first Irish Catholic and the first Catholic to 
 head the nation but how many men of ability had before 1961 been denied the opportunity 
 to contribute to the nation 's progress because they were Catholic or because they were of 
 Irish extraction How many sons of Italian or Jewish or Polish parents slumbered in the slums 
 untaught unlearned their potential lost forever to our nation and to the human race Even 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 today what price will we pay before we have assured full opportunity to millions of Negro 
 Americans 
 In the last five years we have done more to assure equality to our Negro citizens and to help 
 the deprived both white and black than in the hundred years before that time But much 
 much more remains to be done For there are millions of Negroes untrained for the simplest of 
 jobs and thousands every day denied their full and equal rights under the law and the 
 violence of the disinherited the insulted the injured looms over the streets of Harlem and of 
 Watts and of the South Side Chicago 
 But a Negro American trains now as an astronaut one of mankind 's first explorers into outer 
 space another is the chief barrister of the United States government and dozens sit on the 
 benches of our court and another Dr. Martin Luther King is the second man of African 
 descent to win the Nobel Peace Prize2 for his nonviolent efforts for social justice between all of 
 the races 
 We have passed laws prohibiting We have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in 
 education in employment in housing but these laws alone can not overcome the heritage of 
 centuries of broken families and stunted children and poverty and degradation and pain 
 So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy and great cost and danger march 
 alongside all of us We are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change and that is 
 important to all to understand though change is unsettling Still even in the turbulence of 
 protest and struggle is greater hope for the future as men learn to claim and achieve for 
 themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others 
 And most important of all all of the panoply of government power has been committed to the 
 goal of equality before the law as we are now committing ourselves to the achievement of 
 equal opportunity in fact We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people 
 before God before the law and in the councils of government We must do this not because 
 it is economically advantageous although it is not because the laws of God command it 
 although they do not because people in other lands wish it so We must do it for the single 
 and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do 
 We recognize that there are problems and obstacles before the fulfillment of these ideals in 
 the United States as we recognize that other nations in Latin America and in Asia and in 
 Africa have their own political economic and social problems their unique barriers to the 
 elimination of injustices 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 In some there is concern that change will submerge the rights of a minority particularly 
 where that minority is of a different race than that of the majority We in the United States 
 believe in the protection of minorities we recognize the contributions that they can make and 
 the leadership that they can provide and we do not believe that any people whether 
 majority or minority or individual human beings are expendable in the cause of theory or 
 of policy We recognize also that justice between men and nations is imperfect and the 
 humanity sometimes progresses very slowly indeed 
 All do not develop in the same manner and at the same pace Nations like men often march 
 to the beat of different drummers and the precise solutions of the United States can neither 
 be dictated nor transplanted to others and that is not our intention What is important 
 however is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom toward justice for all 
 toward a society strong and flexible enough to meet the demands of all of its people 
 whatever their race and the demands that the world of immense and dizzying change that 
 face us all 
 In a few hours the plane that brought me to this country crossed over oceans and countries 
 which have been a crucible of human history In minutes we traced migrations of men over 
 thousands of years seconds the briefest glimpse and we passed battlefields on which 
 millions of men once struggled and died We could see no national boundaries no vast gulfs 
 or high walls dividing people from people only nature and the works of man homes and 
 factories and farms everywhere reflecting Man 's common effort to enrich his life 
 Everywhere new technology and communications brings men and nations closer together the 
 concerns of one inevitably becomes the concerns of all And our new closeness is stripping 
 away the false masks the illusion of differences which is the root of injustice and of hate and 
 of war Only earthbound man still clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world 
 is   hill his universe ends at river shore his common humanity is 
 enclosed in the tight circle of those who share his town or his views and the color of his skin 
 It is It is your job the task of young people in this world to strip the last remnants of that 
 ancient cruel belief from the civilization of man 
 Each nation has different obstacles and different goals   of history and 
 of experience Yet as I talk to young people around the world I am impressed not by the 
 diversity   of their goals their desires and their concerns and their hope 
 for the future There is discrimination in New York the racial inequality of apartheid in South 
 Africa and serfdom in the mountains of Peru People starve to death in the streets of India a 
 former Prime Minister is summarily executed in the Congo intellectuals go to jail in Russia 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 and thousands are slaughtered in Indonesia wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere in 
 the world 
 These are different evils but they are the common works of man They reflect the 
 imperfections of human justice the inadequacy of human compassion the defectiveness of 
 our sensibility toward the sufferings of our fellows they mark the limit of our ability to use 
 knowledge for the well being of our fellow human beings throughout the world And therefore 
 they call upon common qualities of conscience and indignation a shared determination to 
 wipe away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings at home and around the 
 world 
 It is these qualities which make of our youth today the only true international community 
 More than this I think that we could agree on what kind of a world we would all want to build 
 It would be a world of independent nations moving toward international community each of 
 which protected and respected the basic human freedoms It would be a world which 
 demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility to insure social justice It would 
 be a world of constantly accelerating economic progress not material welfare as an end 
 in of itself but as a means to liberate the capacity of every human being to pursue his talents 
 and to pursue his hopes It would in short be a world that we would all be proud to have 
 built 
 Just to the north of here are lands of challenge and of opportunity rich in natural resources 
 land and minerals and people Yet they are also lands   odds 
 overwhelming ignorance internal tensions and strife and great obstacles of climate and 
 geography Many of these nations as colonies were oppressed and were exploited Yet they 
 have not estranged themselves from the broad traditions of the West they are hoping and 
 they are gambling their progress and their stability on the chance that we will meet our 
 responsibilities to them to help them overcome their poverty 
 In the world we would like to build South Africa could play an outstanding role and a role of 
 leadership in that effort This country is without question a preeminent repository of the 
 wealth and the knowledge and the skill of this continent Here are the greater part of Africa 's 
 research scientists and steel production most of its reservoirs of coal and of electric power 
 Many South Africans have made major contributions to African technical development and 
 world science The names of some are known wherever men seek to eliminate the ravages of 
 tropical disease and of pestilence In your faculties and councils here in this very audience 
 are hundreds and thousands of men and women who could transform the lives of millions for 
 all time to come 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 But the help and the leadership of South Africa or of the United States can not be accepted if 
 we within our own country or in our relationships with others deny individual integrity 
 human dignity and the common humanity of man If we would lead outside our own borders 
 if we would help those who need our assistance if we would meet our responsibilities to 
 mankind we must first all of us demolish the borders which history has erected between 
 men within our own nations barriers of race and religion social class and ignorance 
 Our answer is the world 's hope It is to rely on youth The cruelties and the obstacles of this 
 swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans It can not be 
  cling to a present which is already dying who prefer the illusion of 
 security to the excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful progress 
 This world demands the qualities of youth not a time of life but a state of mind a temper of 
 the will a quality of the imagination a predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite 
 for adventure over the life of ease a man like the Chancellor of this University 
 It is a revolutionary world that we all live in and thus as I have said in Latin America and in 
 Asia and in Europe and in my own country the United States it is the young people who must 
 take the lead Thus you and your young compatriots everywhere have had thrust upon you 
 a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived 
 There is said an Italian philosopher nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous 
 to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new 
 order of things ""3 Yet this is the measure of the task of your generation and the road is 
 strewn with many dangers 
 First is the danger of futility the belief there is nothing one man or one woman can do 
 against the enormous array of the world 's ills against misery against ignorance or injustice 
 and violence Yet many of the world 's great movements of thought and action have flowed 
 from the work of a single man A young monk began the Protestant Reformation a young 
 general extended an empire from Macedonia to the borders of the earth and a young woman 
 reclaimed the territory of France It was a young Italian explorer who discovered the New 
 World and 32 year old Thomas Jefferson who proclaimed that all men are created equal 
 Give me a place to stand said Archimedes and I will move the world ""4 These men moved 
 the world and so can we all Few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can 
 work to change a small portion of the events and then the total all of these acts will be 
 written in the history of this generation 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 Thousands of Peace Corps volunteers are making a difference in the isolated villages and the 
 city slums of dozens of countries Thousands of unknown men and women in Europe resisted 
 the occupation of the Nazis and many died but all added to the ultimate strength and 
 freedom of their countries It is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that 
 the belief that human history is thus shaped Each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts 
 to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of 
 hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those 
 ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance 
 If Athens shall appear great to you said Pericles consider then that her glories were 
 5 That is the source of all 
 greatness in all societies and it is the key to progress in our time 
 The second danger is that of expediency of those who say that hopes and beliefs must bend 
 before immediate necessities Of course if we must act effectively we must deal with the 
 world as it is We must get things done But if there was one thing that President Kennedy 
 stood for that touched the most profound feeling of young people around the world it was the 
 belief that idealism high aspirations and deep convictions are not incompatible with the most 
 practical and efficient of programs that there is no basic inconsistency between ideals and 
 realistic possibilities no separation between the deepest desires of heart and of mind and the 
 rational application of human effort to human problems It is not realistic or hardheaded to 
 solve problems and take action   aims and values although we all 
 know some who claim that it is so In my judgment it is thoughtless folly For it ignores the 
 realities of human faith and of passion and of belief forces ultimately more powerful than all 
 of the calculations of our economists or of our generals Of course to adhere to standards to 
 idealism to vision in the face of immediate dangers takes great courage and takes self- 
 confidence But we also know that only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve 
 greatly 
 It is this new idealism which is also I believe the common heritage of a generation which has 
 learned that while efficiency can lead to the camps at Auschwitz or the streets of Budapest 
 only the ideals of humanity and love can climb the hills of the Acropolis 
 And a third danger is timidity Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows 
 the censure of their colleagues the wrath of their society Moral courage is a rarer commodity 
 than bravery in battle or great intelligence Yet it is the one essential vital quality for those 
 who seek to change the world which yields most painfully to change Aristotle tells us At 
 the Olympic games it is not the finest or the strongest men who are crowned but those who 
  
  
 
                                                                    
 enter the lists So too in the life of the honorable and the good it is they who act rightly 
 who win the prize ""6 I believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the 
 conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the world 
 For the fortunate amongst us the fourth danger my friends is comfort the temptation to 
 follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly 
 spread before those who have the privilege of an education But that is not the road history 
 has marked out for us There is a Chinese curse which says May he live in interesting times 
 Like it or not we live in interesting times They are times of danger and uncertainty but they 
 are also the most creative of any time in the history of mankind And everyone here will 
 ultimately be judged will ultimately judge himself on the effort he has contributed to building 
 a new world society and the extent to which his ideals and goals have shaped that effort 
 So we part I to my country and you to remain We are if a man of 40 can claim the privilege 
 fellow members of the world 's largest younger generation Each of us have our own work to 
 do I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and with your difficulties 
 But I want to say how I impressed I am with the stand with what you stand for and for 
 the effort that you are making and I say this not just for myself but men and women all over 
 the world And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with 
 your fellow young people in every land they struggling with their problems and you with 
 yours but all joined in a common purpose that like the young people of my own country and 
 of every country that I have visited you are all in many ways more closely united to the 
 brothers of your time than to the older generations in any of these nations You 're determined 
 to build a better future  
 President Kennedy was speaking to the young people of America but beyond them to young 
 people everywhere when he said the energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this 
 endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light 
 the world And he added With a good conscience our only sure reward with history the 
 final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love asking His blessing and His 
 help but knowing that here on earth God 's work must truly be our own ""7 
 I thank you

 without axiological consequence Aristotle places the emphasis on action per se so those who act win and rightly win the noble and good 
 things in life with the justification for winning following logically from the fact of merely committing to action Kennedy places the moral qualifier 
 rightly in conjunction with action thereby suggesting that it is right action not merely action itself that justifies the victor Three years

11,Gerald R. Ford,Address to the Nation Pardoning Richard M. Nixon,1974," 
 
 
 Ladies and gentlemen I have come to a decision which I felt I should tell you and all of my 
 fellow American citizens as soon as I was certain in my own mind and in my own conscience 
 that it is the right thing to do I have learned already in this office that the difficult decisions 
 always come to this desk I must admit that many of them do not look at all the same as the 
 hypothetical questions that I have answered freely and perhaps too fast on previous 
 occasions 
 My customary policy is to try and get all the facts and to consider the opinions of my 
 countrymen and to take counsel with my most valued friends But these seldom agree and in 
 the end the decision is mine To procrastinate to agonize and to wait for a more favorable 
 turn of events that may never come or more compelling external pressures that may as well 
 be wrong as right is itself a decision of sorts and a weak and potentially dangerous course for 
 a President to follow 
 I have promised to uphold the Constitution to do what is right as God gives me to see the 
 right and to do the very best that I can for America I have asked your help and your 
 prayers not only when I became President but many times since The Constitution is the 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
        
        
 supreme law of our land and it governs our actions as citizens Only the laws of God which 
 govern our consciences are superior to it 
 As we are a nation under God so I am sworn to uphold our laws with the help of God And I 
 have sought such guidance and searched my own conscience with special diligence to 
 determine the right thing for me to do with respect to my predecessor in this place Richard 
 Nixon and his loyal wife and family Theirs is an American tragedy in which we all all have 
 played a part It could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to it I have 
 concluded that only I can do that and if I can I must 
 There are no historic or legal precedents to which I can turn in this matter none that precisely 
 fit the circumstances of a private citizen who has resigned the Presidency of the United States 
 But it is common knowledge that serious allegations and accusations hang like a sword over 
 our former President 's head threatening his health as he tries to reshape his life a great part 
 of which was spent in the service of this country  
 After years of bitter controversy and divisive national debate I have been advised and I am 
 compelled to conclude that many months and perhaps more years will have to pass before 
 Richard Nixon could obtain a fair   any jurisdiction of the United States under 
 governing decisions of the Supreme Court I deeply believe in equal justice for all Americans 
 whatever their station or former station The law whether human or divine is no respecter of 
 persons but the law is a respecter of reality 
 The facts as I see them are that a former President of the United States instead of enjoying 
 equal treatment with any other citizen accused of violating the law would be cruelly and 
 excessively penalized either in preserving the presumption of his innocence or in obtaining a 
 speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay a legal debt to society During this long 
 period of delay and potential litigation ugly passions would again be aroused And our people 
 would again be polarized in their opinions And the credibility of our free institutions of 
 government would again be challenged at home and abroad In the end the courts might well 
 hold that Richard Nixon had been denied due process and the verdict of history would even 
 more be inconclusive with respect to those charges arising out of the period of his Presidency 
 of which I am presently aware 
 But it is not the ultimate fate of Richard Nixon that most concerns me though surely it deeply 
 troubles every decent and every compassionate person My concern is the immediate future of 
 this great country In this I dare not depend upon my personal sympathy as a long time 
 friend of the former President nor my professional judgment as a lawyer and I do not 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
        
        
 As President my primary concern must always be the greatest good of all the people of the 
 United States whose servant I am As a man my first consideration is to be true to my own 
 convictions and my own conscience My conscience tells me clearly and certainly that I can not 
 prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that is closed My conscience tells 
 me that only I as President have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book 
 My conscience tells me it is my duty not merely to proclaim domestic tranquility but to use 
 every means that I have to insure it 
 I do believe that the buck stops here that I can not rely upon public opinion polls to tell me 
 what is right 
 I do believe that right makes might and that if I am wrong 10 angels swearing I was right 
 would make no difference 
 I do believe with all my heart and mind and spirit that I not as President but as a humble 
 servant of God will receive justice without mercy if I fail to show mercy 
 Finally I feel that Richard Nixon and his loved ones have suffered enough and will continue to 
 suffer no matter what I do no matter what we as a great and good nation can do together 
 to make his goal of peace come true 
 Now therefore I Gerald R. Ford President of the United States pursuant to the pardon 
 power conferred upon Section 2 of the Constitution have granted and by 
 these presents do grant a full free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses 
 against the United States which he Richard Nixon has committed or may have committed or 
 taken part in during the period from July 20 1969 through August 9 1974 
                  
 In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September in the year 
 of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy four and of the Independence of the United States 
 of America the one hundred and ninety ninth

12,Elie Wiesel,The Perils of Indifference,1999," 
 
 
 Mr. President Mrs. Clinton members of Congress Ambassador Holbrooke Excellencies 
 friends  
 Fifty four years ago to the day a young Jewish boy from a small town in the Carpathian 
 Mountains woke up not far from Goethe 's beloved Weimar in a place of eternal infamy called 
 Buchenwald He was finally free but there was no joy in his heart He thought there never 
 would be again Liberated a day he remembers their rage at 
 what they saw And even if he lives to be a very old man he will always be grateful to them 
 for that rage and also for their compassion Though he did not understand their language 
 their eyes told him what he needed to know that they too would remember and bear 
 witness  
 And now I stand before you Mr. President Commander in Chief of the army that freed me 
 and tens of thousands of others and I am filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the 
 American people 
  
  
 
                          
 Gratitude is a word that I cherish Gratitude is what defines the humanity of the human 
 being And I am grateful to you Hillary or Mrs. Clinton for what you said and for what you 
 are doing for children in the world for the homeless for the victims of injustice the victims of 
 destiny and society And I thank all of you for being here  
 We are on the threshold of a new century a new millennium What will the legacy of this 
 vanishing century be How will it be remembered in the new millennium Surely it will be 
 judged and judged severely in both moral and metaphysical terms These failures have cast 
 a dark shadow over humanity two World Wars countless civil wars the senseless chain of 
 assassinations Gandhi the Kennedys Martin Luther King Sadat Rabin bloodbaths in 
 Cambodia and Algeria India and Pakistan Ireland and Rwanda Eritrea and Ethiopia Sarajevo 
 and Kosovo the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima And on a different 
 level of course Auschwitz and Treblinka So much violence so much indifference  
 What is indifference Etymologically the word means no difference A strange and unnatural 
 state in which the lines blur between light and darkness dusk and dawn crime and 
 punishment cruelty and compassion good and evil What are its courses and inescapable 
 consequences Is it a philosophy Is there a philosophy of indifference conceivable Can one 
 possibly view indifference as a virtue Is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep 
 one 's sanity live normally enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine as the world around us 
 experiences harrowing upheavals  
 Of course indifference can be tempting more than that seductive It is so much easier to 
 look away from victims It is so much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work our 
 dreams our hopes It is after all awkward troublesome to be involved in another person 's 
 pain and despair Yet for the person who is indifferent his or her neighbor are of no 
 consequence And therefore their lives are meaningless Their hidden or even visible anguish 
 is of no interest Indifference reduces the Other to an abstraction  
 Over there behind the black gates of Auschwitz the most tragic of all prisoners were the 
 Muselmanner as they were called Wrapped in their torn blankets they would sit or lie on 
 the ground staring vacantly into space unaware of who or where they were strangers to 
 their surroundings They no longer felt pain hunger thirst They feared nothing They felt 
 nothing They were dead and did not know it  
 Rooted in our tradition some of us felt that to be   was not the 
 ultimate We felt that to be   worse than to be  
 an unjust God than an indifferent one 
  
  
 
                          
 For us to be   a harsher punishment than to be a victim of His anger Man 
 can live far from God not outside God God is wherever we are Even in suffering Even in 
 suffering  
 In a way to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman 
 Indifference after all is more dangerous than anger and hatred Anger can at times be 
 creative One writes a great poem a great symphony One does something special for the 
 sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one witnesses But indifference is 
 never creative Even hatred at times may elicit a response You fight it You denounce it You 
 disarm it  
 Indifference elicits no response Indifference is not a response Indifference is not a 
 beginning it is an end And therefore indifference is always the friend of the enemy for it 
 benefits the aggressor never his victim whose pain is magnified when he or she feels 
 forgotten The political prisoner in his cell the hungry children the homeless refugees not 
 to respond to their plight not to relieve their   a spark of hope is to 
 exile them from human memory And in denying their humanity we betray our own  
 Indifference then is not only a sin it is a punishment  
 And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century 's wide ranging 
 experiments in good and evil  
 In the place that I come from society was composed of three simple categories the killers 
 the victims and the bystanders During the darkest of times inside the ghettoes and death 
 camps and I 'm glad that Mrs. Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that 
 event that period that we are now in the Days of Remembrance but then we felt 
 abandoned forgotten All of us did  
 And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitz and Treblinka were 
 closely guarded secrets that the leaders of the free world did not know what was going on 
 behind those black gates and barbed wire that they had no knowledge of the war against the 
 Jews that Hitler 's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the Allies If 
 they knew we thought surely those leaders would have moved heaven and earth to 
 intervene They would have spoken out with great outrage and conviction They would have 
 bombed the railways leading to Birkenau just the railways just once  
  
  
 
                          
 And now we knew we learned we discovered that the Pentagon knew the State Department 
 knew And the illustrious occupant of the White House then who was a great leader and I 
 say it with some anguish and pain because today is exactly 54 years marking his death 
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt died on April the 12th 1945 So he is very much present to me and 
 to us No doubt he was a great leader He mobilized the American people and the world 
 going into battle bringing hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in America to 
 fight fascism to fight dictatorship to fight Hitler And so many of the young people fell in 
 battle And nevertheless his image in Jewish history I must say it his image in Jewish 
 history is flawed 
 The depressing tale of the St. Louis is a case in point Sixty years ago its human cargo 
 nearly 1,000 Jews was turned back to Nazi Germany And that happened after the 
 Kristallnacht after the first state sponsored pogrom with hundreds of Jewish shops 
 destroyed synagogues burned thousands of people put in concentration camps And that 
 ship which was already in the shores of the United States was sent back I do n't understand 
 Roosevelt was a good man with a heart He understood those who needed help 
 Why did n't he allow these refugees to disembark A thousand people in America the great 
 country the greatest democracy the most generous of all new nations in modern history 
 What happened I do n't understand Why the indifference on the highest level to the 
 suffering of the victims  
 But then there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy Those non Jews those 
 Christians that we call the Righteous Gentiles whose selfless acts of heroism saved the 
 honor of their faith Why were they so few Why was there a greater effort to save SS 
 murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war Why did some of America 's 
 largest corporations continue to do business with Hitler 's Germany until 1942 It has been 
 suggested and it was documented that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion 
 of France without oil obtained from American sources How is one to explain their 
 indifference  
 And yet my friends good things have also happened in this traumatic century the defeat of 
 Nazism the collapse of communism the rebirth of Israel on its ancestral soil the demise of 
 apartheid Israel 's peace treaty with Egypt the peace accord in Ireland And let us remember 
 the meeting filled with drama and emotion between Rabin and Arafat that you Mr. 
 President convened in this very place I was here and I will never forget it  
  
  
 
                          
 And then of course the joint decision of the United States and NATO to intervene in Kosovo 
 and save those victims those refugees those who were whom I believe 
 that because of his crimes should be charged with crimes against humanity  
 But this time the world was not silent This time we do respond This time we intervene  
 Does it mean that we have learned from the past Does it mean that society has changed 
 Has the human being become less indifferent and more human Have we really learned from 
 our experiences Are we less insensitive to the plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other 
 forms of injustices in places near and far Is today 's justified intervention in Kosovo led by 
 you Mr. President a lasting warning that never again will the deportation the terrorization of 
 children and their parents be allowed anywhere in the world Will it discourage other 
 dictators in other lands to do the same  
 What about the children Oh we see them on television we read about them in the papers 
 and we do so with a broken heart Their fate is always the most tragic inevitably When 
 adults wage war children perish We see their faces their eyes Do we hear their pleas Do 
 we feel their pain their agony Every minute one of them dies of disease violence famine  
 Some of them so many of them could be saved  
 And so once again I think of the young Jewish boy from the Carpathian Mountains He has 
 accompanied the old man I have become throughout these years of quest and struggle And 
 together we walk towards the new millennium   and extraordinary 
 hope",0.3430671691894531,0.0506269447505474,0.1968383342027664,0.0571094453334808,0.177929475903511,0.1645476520061493,0.0098810121417045,0.0734484624570831,0.5229415460018907,59.38905622786305,0.3276699029126214,0.021333333333333333,0.13048368953880765,0.071875,17.441860465116278,1.0
13,John Kerry,Statement Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,1971," 
 
 
 Thank you very much Senator Fulbright Senator Javits Senator Symington Senator Pell 
 I would like to say for the record that and also for the men behind me who are also wearing 
 the uniform and their medals that my sitting up here is really symbolic I 'm not here as 
 John Kerry I 'm here as one member of a group of 1000 which is a small representation of a 
 very much larger group of veterans in this country And were it possible for all of them to sit 
 at this table they would be here and have the same kind of testimony 
 I would simply like to speak in very general terms I I apologize if my statement is general 
 because I received notification yesterday you would hear me and I 'm afraid because of the 
 injunction I was up most of the night and have n’t had a great deal of chance to prepare 
 I would like to talk representing of all those veterans and say that several months ago in 
 Detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged and many very 
 highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia 
  
  
 
                         
 
 These were not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day to day basis with the full 
 awareness of officers at all levels of command It 's impossible to describe to you exactly what 
 did happen in Detroit the emotions in the room and the feelings of the men who were 
 reliving their experiences in Vietnam But they did They relived the absolute horror of what 
 this country in a sense made them do 
 They told the stories of times that they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped 
 wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs 
 blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in the fashion reminiscent of 
 Genghis Khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the 
 countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and 
 very particular ravaging which is   bombing power of this country 
 We call this investigation the Winter Soldier Investigation The term Winter Soldier is a play 
 on words of Thomas Paine 's in 1776 when he spoke of the Sunshine Patriot and summertime 
 soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough 
 And we who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be 
 winter soldiers now We could come back to this country and we could be quiet we could 
 hold our silence we could not tell what went on in Vietnam But we feel because of what 
 threatens this country the fact that the crimes threaten it not reds not redcoats but the 
 crimes which we ’re committing are what threaten it and we have to speak out 
 I would like to talk to you a little bit about what the result is of of the feelings these men 
 carry with them after coming back from Vietnam The country does n’t know it yet but it ’s 
 created a monster a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal 
 and to trade in violence and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in 
 history men who have returned with a sense of anger and a sense of betrayal which no one 
 has yet grasped 
 As a veteran and one who feels this anger I ’d like to talk about it We ’re angry because we 
 feel we have been used in the worst   In 1970 at 
 West Point Vice President Agnew said 
 Some glamorize the criminal misfits of society while our best men die in Asian rice 
 paddies to preserve the freedoms which those misfits abuse 
  
  
 
                         
 And this was used as a rallying point for our effort in Vietnam 
 But for us his boys in Asia whom the country was supposed to support his statement is a 
 terrible distortion from which we can only draw a very deep sense of revulsion and hence the 
 anger of some of the men who are here in Washington today 
 It ’s a distortion because we in no way considered ourselves the best men of this country 
 because those he calls misfits were standing up for us in a way that nobody else in this 
 country dared to because so many who have died would have returned to this country to join 
 the misfits in their efforts to ask for an immediate withdrawal from South Vietnam because 
 so many of those best men have returned as quadriplegics and amputees and they lie 
 forgotten in Veterans Administration hospitals in this country which fly the flag which so many 
 have chosen as their own personal symbol  
 And we can not consider ourselves America ’s best men when we were ashamed of and hated 
 what we were called to do in Southeast Asia In our opinion and from our experience there is 
 nothing in South Vietnam nothing which could happen that realistically threatens the United 
 States of America And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam 
 Cambodia or   loss to the preservation of freedom which those misfits 
 supposedly abuse is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy and it ’s that kind of hypocrisy 
 which we feel has torn this country apart 
 We are probably much more angry than that and I do n’t want to go into the foreign policy 
 aspects because I ’m outclassed here I know that all of you have talked about every possible 
 every possible alternative to getting out of Vietnam We understand that We know that 
 you ’ve considered the seriousness of the aspects to the utmost level and I ’m not going to try 
 and deal on that But I want to relate to you the feeling which many of the men who ’ve 
 returned to this country express because we are probably angriest about all that we were told 
 about Vietnam and about the mystical war against communism 
 We found that not only was it a civil war an   who had for years been 
 seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever but also we found that the 
 Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to 
 take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from 
 We found that most people did n’t even know the difference between communism and 
 democracy They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and 
 bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart They wanted 
  
  
 
                         
 everything to do with the war particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of 
 America to leave them alone in peace and they practiced the art of  
 whichever military force was present at a particular time be it Vietcong North Vietnamese or 
 American 
 We found also that all too often American men were dying in those rice paddies for want of 
 support from their allies We saw first hand how monies from American taxes was used for a 
 corrupt dictatorial regime We saw that many people in this country had a one sided idea of 
 who was kept as blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties We 
 saw Vietnam ravaged   as well   destroy missions 
 as well and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of 
 the havoc on the Vietcong 
 We rationalized destroying villages in order to save them We saw America lose her sense of 
 morality as she accepted very coolly a My Lai and refused to give up the image of American 
 soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum We learned the meaning of free fire 
 zones shoot anything that moves and we watched while America placed a cheapness on 
 the lives of Orientals We watched the United States falsification of body counts in fact the 
 glorification of body counts We listened while month after month we were told the back of the 
 enemy was about to break 
 We fought using weapons against oriental human beings with quotation marks around that 
 We fought using weapons against those people which I do not believe this country would 
 dream of using were we fighting in a European theater or let us say a non third world 
 people theater And so we watched while men charged up hills because a general said That 
 hill has to be taken And after losing one platoon or two platoons they marched away to leave 
 the hill for the   Vietnamese because because we watched pride 
 allow the most unimportant of battles to be blown into extravaganzas because we could n’t 
 lose and we could n’t retreat and because it did n’t matter how many American bodies were 
 lost to prove that point And so there were Hamburger Hills and Khe Sahns and Hill 881 's and 
 Fire Base 6 's and so many others 
 And now we ’re told that the men who fought there must watch quietly while American lives 
 are lost so that we can exercise the incredible arrogance of Vietnamizing the Vietnamese 
 Each day Each 
  
  
 
                         
 Committee Chair Sen. Fulbright I hope you wo n’t interrupt He ’s making a very 
 significant statement And let him proceed 
 Mr. Kerry Each day to facilitate the   United States washes her hands of 
 Vietnam someone has to give up his life so that United States does n’t have to admit 
 something that the entire world already knows so that we ca n’t say that we ’ve made a 
 mistake Someone has to die so that President Nixon wo n’t be and these are his words the 
 first President to lose a war ”1 
 And we are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the 
 last man to die in Vietnam How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake 
 But we ’re trying to do that and we ’re doing it with thousands of rationalizations and if you 
 read carefully the President ’s last speech to the people of this country you can see that he 
 says and says clearly 
 But the issue gentlemen the issue is communism and the question is whether or not 
 we will leave that country to the Communists or whether or not we will try to give it 
 hope to be a free people.2 
 But the point is they ’re not a free people now under us They ’re not a free people And we 
 can not fight communism all over the world and I think we should have learnt that lesson by 
 now 
 But the problem of veterans goes beyond this personal problem because you think about a 
 poster in this country with a picture of Uncle Sam and the picture says I want you And a 
 young man comes out of high school and says That ’s fine I ’m going to serve my country 
 And he goes to Vietnam and he shoots and he kills and he does his job or maybe he does n’t 
 kill maybe he just goes and he comes back When he gets back to this country he finds that 
 he is n’t really wanted because the largest unemployment figure in the country it varies 
 depending on who you get it from the Veterans Administration 15 percent various other 
 sources 22 percent but the largest figure of unemployed in this country are veterans of this 
 war And of those veterans 33 percent of the unemployed are black That means 1 out of 
 every 10 of the nation ’s unemployed is a veteran of Vietnam 
 The hospitals across the country wo n’t or ca n’t meet their demands It ’s not a question of not 
 trying They have n’t got the appropriations A man recently died after he had a tracheotomy 
 in California not because of the operation but because there were n’t enough personnel to 
 clean the mucous out of his tube and he suffocated to death 
  
  
 
                         
 Another young man just died in a New York VA hospital the other day A friend of mine was 
 lying in a bed two beds away and tried to help him but he could n’t They rang a bell and 
 there was no one there to service that man and so he died of convulsions 
 Fifty seven percent I understand 57 percent of all those entering VA hospitals talk about 
 suicide Some 27 percent have tried and they try because they come back to this country and 
 they have to face what they did in Vietnam and then they come back and find the 
 indifference of a country that does n’t really care that does n’t really care 
 And suddenly we are faced with a very sickening situation in this country because there ’s no 
 moral indignation and if there is it comes from people who are almost  
 indignancies and I know that many of them are sitting in front of me The country seems to 
 have lied lain down and accepted something as serious as Laos just as we calmly shrugged 
 off the loss of 700,000 lives in Pakistan the so called greatest disaster of all times 
 But we are here as veterans to say that we think we are in the midst of the greatest disaster 
 of all times now because they are still dying over there and not just Americans Vietnamese 
 and we are rationalizing leaving that country so that those people can go on killing each other 
 for years to come Americans seem to have accepted the idea that the war is winding down 
 at least for Americans and they have also allowed the bodies which were once used by a 
 President for statistics to prove that we were winning this war to be used as evidence against 
 a man who followed orders and who interpreted those orders no differently than hundreds of 
 other men in South Vietnam 
 We veterans can only look with amazement on the fact that this country has not been able to 
 see that there 's absolutely no difference between a ground troop and a helicopter crew And 
 yet people have accepted the differentiation fed   No ground 
 troops are in Laos so it 's alright to kill   But believe me the 
 helicopter crews fill the same body bags and they wreak the same kind of damage on the 
 Vietnamese and Laotian countryside as anyone else and the President is talking about 
 allowing that to go on for many years to come And one can only ask if we will really be 
 satisfied when the troops march in to Hanoi 
 We are asking here in Washington for some action action from the Congress of the United 
 States of America which has the power to raise and maintain armies and which by the 
 Constitution also has the power to declare war We 've come here not to the President 
 because we believe that this body can be responsive to the will of the people and we believe 
 that the will of the people says that we should be out of Vietnam now 
  
  
 
                         
 We 're here in Washington also to say that the problem of this war is not just a question of war 
 and diplomacy 
 It 's part and parcel of everything that we are trying as human beings to communicate to 
 people in this country the question of racism which is rampant in the military and so many 
 other questions also the use of weapons the hypocrisy in our taking umbrage in 
 the Geneva Conventions and using that as justification for continuation of this war when we 
 are more guilty than any other body of violations of those Geneva Conventions in the use of 
 free fire zones harassment interdiction fire search and destroy missions the bombings the 
 torture of prisoners the killing of prisoners accepted   in South 
 Vietnam That 's what we 're trying to say It 's part and parcel of everything   
 An American Indian friend of mine who lives on the Indian nation of Alcatraz put it to me very 
 succinctly He told me how as a boy on an Indian reservation he had watched television and 
 he used to cheer the cowboys when they came in and shot the Indians And then suddenly 
 one day he stopped in Vietnam and he said My God I 'm doing to these people the very 
 same thing that was done to my people and he stopped And that 's what we 're trying to 
 say that we think this thing has to end 
 We 're also here to ask We are here to ask and we 're here to ask vehemently Where are the 
 leaders of our country Where is the leadership We 're here to ask Where are McNamara 
 Rostow Bundy3 Kilpatrick4 and so many others Where are they now that we the men whom 
 they sent off to war have returned These are commanders who have deserted their troops 
 and there is no more serious crime in the law of war The Army says they never leave their 
 wounded The Marines say they never leave even their dead These men have left all the 
 casualties and retreated behind a pious shield of public rectitude They 've left the real stuff of 
 their reputations bleaching behind them in the sun in this country 
 And finally this Administration has done us the ultimate dishonor They 've attempted to 
 disown us and the sacrifices we made for this country In their blindness and fear they have 
 tried to deny that we are veterans or that we served in Nam We do not need their 
 testimony Our own scars and stumps of limbs are witness enough for others and for 
 ourselves We wish that a merciful God could wipe away our own memories of that service as 
 easily as this Administration has wiped their memories of us 
 And all that they have done and all that they can   is to make more clear than 
 ever our own determination to undertake one last mission to search out and destroy the last 
  
  
 
                         
 vestige of this barbaric war to pacify our own hearts to conquer the hate and fear that have 
 driven this country these last 10 years and more and more 
 
 And so in 30 years from now our brothers go down the street without a leg without an arm 
 or a face and small boys ask why we will be able to say Vietnam and not mean a desert 
 not a filthy obscene memory but mean instead the place where America finally turned and 
 where soldiers like us helped it in the turning

14,Dwight D. Eisenhower,Atoms for Peace,1953," 
 
 
 Madam President Members of the General Assembly 
 When Secretary General Hammarskjold ’s invitation to address this General Assembly reached 
 me in Bermuda I was just beginning a series of conferences with the Prime Ministers and 
 Foreign Ministers of Great Britain and of France Our subject was some of the problems that 
 beset our world 
 During the remainder of the Bermuda Conference I had constantly in mind that ahead of me 
 lay a great honor That honor is mine today as I stand here privileged to address the General 
 Assembly of the United Nations 
 At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you I have a sense of 
 exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly Never before in history has so much hope for so 
 many people been gathered together in a single organization Your deliberations and decisions 
 during these somber years have already realized part of those hopes 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead And in the confident 
 expectation of those accomplishments I would use the office which for the time being I hold 
 to assure you that the Government of the United States will remain steadfast in its support of 
 this body This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom 
 of the courage and the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations and 
 happiness and well being for all men  
 Clearly it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral 
 American report on Bermuda Nevertheless I assure you that in our deliberations on that 
 lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human 
 dignity which are so cleanly etched in your Charter Neither would it be a measure of this 
 great opportunity merely to recite however hopefully pious platitudes 
 I therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that 
 have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates and on mine 
 for a great many months thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American 
 people 
 I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world it is 
 a danger  equally that if hope exists in the mind of one nation that hope 
 should be shared by all 
 Finally if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease  
 measure the tensions of today ’s world what more appropriate audience could there be than 
 the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations I feel impelled to speak today in 
 a language that in a sense is new one which I who have spent so much of my life in the 
 military profession would have preferred never to use That new language is the language of 
 atomic warfare 
 The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have 
 some comprehension at least in comparative terms of the extent of this development of the 
 utmost significance to everyone of us Clearly if the peoples of the world are to conduct an 
 intelligent search for peace they must be armed with the significant facts of today ’s 
 existence 
 My recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United States terms for these 
 are the only incontrovertible facts that I know I need hardly point out to this Assembly 
 however that this subject is global not merely national in character 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 On July 16 1945 the United States set off the world ’s first atomic explosion 
 Since that date in 1945 the United States of America has conducted forty two test explosions 
 Atomic bombs today are more than twenty five times as powerful as the weapons with which 
 the atomic age dawned while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT 
 equivalent 
 Today the United States stockpile of atomic weapons which of course increases daily 
  the total explosive equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells 
 that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all the years of World 
 War II 
 A single air group whether afloat or land based can now deliver to any reachable target a 
 destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all of World War II 
 In size and variety the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable The 
 development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status 
 within our armed services 
 In the United States the Army the Navy the Air Force and the Marine Corps are all capable 
 of putting this weapon to military use But the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic 
 might are not ours alone 
 In the first place the secret is   and allies Great Britain and Canada 
 whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries and the 
 designs of atomic bombs 
 The secret is also   Union 
 The Soviet Union has informed us that over recent years it has devoted extensive resources 
 to atomic weapons During this period the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic 
 devices including at least one involving thermo nuclear reactions If at one time the Unites 
 States possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power that monopoly 
 ceased to exist several years ago 
 Therefore although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great 
 quantitative advantage the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater 
 significance 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 First the knowledge now   will eventually be shared by others 
 possibly all others 
 Second even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons and a consequent capability of 
 devastating retaliation is no preventive of itself against the fearful material damage and toll 
 of human lives that would be   The free world at least dimly 
 aware of these facts has naturally embarked on a large program of warning and defense 
 systems That program will be accelerated and expanded But let no one think that the 
 expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety 
 for the cities and citizens of any nation The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb does not 
 permit of any such easy solution Even against the most powerful defense an aggressor in 
 possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a surprise attack could 
 probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets to cause hideous 
 damage 
 Should such an atomic attack be launched against the United States our reactions would be 
 swift and resolute But for me to say that the defense capabilities of the United States are 
 such that they could inflict terrible losses upon an aggressor for me to say that the retaliation 
 capabilities of the Unites States are so great that such an aggressor ’s land would be laid 
 waste all this while fact is not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of the United 
 States 
 To pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi are 
 doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world To stop there 
 would be to accept hope helplessly the probability of civilization destroyed the annihilation 
 of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind handed down to use generation from generation and 
 the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age old struggle upward from 
 savagery toward decency and right and justice Surely no sane member of the human race 
 could discover victory in such desolation 
 Could anyone wish his name to be   such human degradation and 
 destruction Occasional pages of history do record the faces of the great destroyers but the 
 whole book of history reveals mankind ’s never ending quest for peace and mankind ’s God- 
 given capacity to build 
 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 It is with the book of history and not with isolated pages that the United States will ever 
 wish to be identified My country wants to be constructive not destructive It wants 
 agreements not wars among nations It wants itself to live in freedom and in the confidence 
 that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life 
 So my country ’s purpose is to help us move out of the dark chamber of horrors into the light 
 to find a   minds of men the hopes of men the souls of men everywhere 
 can move forward toward peace and happiness and well being 
 In this quest I know that we must not lack patience I know that in a world divided such as 
 ours today salvation can not be   act   I know that many steps will 
 have to be taken over many months before the world can look at itself one day and truly 
 realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world But I know 
 above all else that we must start to take these steps now 
 The United States and its allies Great Britain and France have over the past months tried to 
 take some of these steps Let no one say that we shun the conference table On the record 
 has long stood the request of the United States Great Britain and France to negotiate with 
 the Soviet Union the problems of a divided Germany On that record has long stood the 
 request of the same three nations to negotiate an Austrian peace treaty On the same record 
 still stands the request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea 
 Most recently we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect an expression of 
 willingness to hold a four Power meeting Along with our allies Great Britain and France we 
 were pleased to see that his note did not contain the unacceptable pre conditions previously 
 put forward As you already know from our joint Bermuda communiqué the United States 
 Great Britain and France have agreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union 
 The Government of the United States approaches this conference with hopeful sincerity We 
 will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose of emerging from that conference 
 with tangible results towards peace the only true way of lessening international tension We 
 never have we never will propose or suggest that the Soviet Union surrender what is 
 rightfully theirs We will never say that the people of Russia are an enemy with whom we have 
 no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship 
 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 On the contrary we hope that this coming conference may initiate a relationship with the 
 Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of the peoples of the East 
 and of the West the one sure human way of developing the understanding required for 
 confident and peaceful relations 
 Instead of the discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany occupied Austria and 
 the countries of Eastern Europe we seek a harmonious family of free European nations with 
 none a threat to the other and least of all a threat to the peoples of the Russia Beyond the 
 turmoil and strife and misery of Asia we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to 
 develop their natural resources and to elevate their lives 
 These are not idle words or shallow visions Behind them lies a story of nations lately come to 
 independence not as a result of war but through free grant or peaceful negotiation There is 
 a record already written of assistance gladly   the West to needy peoples 
 and to those suffering the temporary effects of famine drought and natural disaster These 
 are deeds of peace They speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent 
 But I do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or the restatement of 
 past deeds The gravity of the time is such that every new avenue of peace no matter how 
 dimly discernible should be explored There is at least one new avenue of peace which has 
 not yet been well explored an avenue now laid   Assembly of the Unites 
 Nations 
 In its resolution of November 18th 1953 this General Assembly suggested and I quote 
 that the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing a sub committee 
 consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved which should seek in private 
 an acceptable solution and report such a solution to the General Assembly and to the Security 
 Council not later than September 1 of 1954 
 The United States heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of the United Nations is 
 instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may be principally 
 involved to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic armaments race which overshadows 
 not only the peace but the very life of the world We shall carry into these private or 
 diplomatic talks a new conception 
 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials 
 for military purposes It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers It 
 must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it 
 to the arts of peace 
 The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build up can be reversed 
 this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon for the benefit of all 
 mankind The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the 
 future That capability already proved is here now today Who can doubt if the entire body 
 of the world ’s scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with 
 which to test and develop their ideas that this capability would rapidly be transformed into 
 universal efficient and economic usage 
 To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds of people and 
 the governments of the East and West there are certain steps that can be taken now I 
 therefore make the following proposals 
 The governments principally involved to the extent to 
 begin now and continue to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium 
 and fissionable materials to an International Atomic Energy Agency We would expect that 
 such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the United Nations  
 The ratios of contributions the procedures and other details would properly be within the 
 scope of the private conversations I have referred to earlier 
 The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith Any partner of 
 the United States acting in the same good faith will find the United States a not unreasonable 
 or ungenerous associate Undoubtedly initial and early contributions to this plan would be 
 small in quantity However the proposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken 
 without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely 
 acceptable system of world wide inspection and control 
 The Atomic Energy Agency could be made responsible for the impounding storage and 
 protection of the contributed fissionable and other materials The ingenuity of our scientists 
 will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be 
 made essentially immune to surprise seizure The more important responsibility of this Atomic 
 Energy Agency would be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be 
 allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind Experts would be mobilized to apply 
  
  
 
        
        
                               
                           
                           
                                   
        
        
             
     
     
                    
               
               
                   
        
                                                        
 atomic energy to the needs of agriculture medicine and other peaceful activities A special 
 purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power starved areas of the 
 world Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the 
 needs rather than the fears of mankind 
 The United States would be more than willing it would be proud to take up with others 
 principally involved the development of plans whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy 
 would be expedited 
 Of those principally involved the Soviet Union must of course be one I would be prepared 
 to submit to the Congress of the United States and with every expectation of approval any 
 such plan that would first encourage world wide investigation into the most effective 
 peacetime uses of fissionable material and with the certainty that they the investigators had 
 all the material needed for the conduct of all experiments that were appropriate second 
 begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the world ’s atomic stockpiles third allow 
 all peoples of all nations to see that in this enlightened age the great Powers of the earth 
 both of the East and of the West are interested in human aspirations first rather than in 
 building up the armaments of war fourth open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and 
 initiate at least a new approach to the many difficult problems that must be solved in both 
 private and public conversations if the world is to shake off the inertia   is 
 to make positive progress toward peace 
 Against the dark background of the atomic bomb the United States does not wish merely to 
 present strength but also the desire and the hope for peace The coming months will be 
 fraught with fateful decisions In this Assembly in the capitals and military headquarters of 
 the world in the hearts of men everywhere be they governed or governors may they be the 
 decisions which will lead this world out of fear and into peace 
 To the making of these fateful decisions the United States pledges before you and therefore 
 before the world its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma to devote its 
 entire heart and mind to find the   miraculous inventiveness of man shall not 
 be dedicated to his death but consecrated to his life  
 I again thank the delegates for the great honor they have done me in inviting me to appear 
 before them and in listening to me so courteously 
 Thank you",0.0122180664911866,0.0068896752782166,0.0558140203356742,0.4562782943248749,0.0326066315174102,0.4183357656002044,0.01785752736032,0.1316227091557488,0.4959936050244417,45.58136534839926,0.2908163265306122,0.010272071071626874,0.07245471580262336,0.048115231382163656,31.321739130434782,1.0
15,George C. Marshall,The Marshall Plan,1947," 
 
 
 Mr. President Dr. Conant members of the Board of Overseers Ladies and Gentlemen  
 I am profoundly grateful   distinction and honor and great compliment 
 accorded   of Harvard this morning I am overwhelmed as a matter of 
 fact and I am rather fearful of my inability to maintain such a high rating as you 've been 
 generous enough to accord to me In these historic and lovely surroundings this perfect day 
 and this very wonderful assembly it is a tremendously impressive thing to an individual in my 
 position 
 But to speak more seriously I need not tell you that the world situation is very serious That 
 must be apparent to all intelligent people I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of 
 such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the  
 radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of 
 the situation Furthermore the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of 
 the earth and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the 
 long suffering peoples of Europe and the effect of those reactions on their governments in 
 connection with our efforts to promote peace in the world 
  
  
 
                                           
 In considering the requirements for the rehabilitation of Europe the physical loss of life the 
 visible destruction of cities factories mines and railroads was correctly estimated but it has 
 become obvious during recent months that this visible destruction was probably less serious 
 than the dislocation of the entire fabric of European economy For the past ten years 
 conditions have been highly abnormal The feverish preparation for war and the more feverish 
 maintenance of the war effort engulfed all aspects of national economies Machinery has fallen 
 into disrepair or is entirely obsolete Under the arbitrary and destructive Nazi rule virtually 
 every possible enterprise was geared into the German war machine Long standing 
 commercial ties private institutions banks insurance companies and shipping companies 
 disappeared through loss of capital absorption through nationalization or by simple 
 destruction In many countries confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken 
 The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete Recovery 
 has been seriously   that two years after the close of hostilities a peace 
 settlement with Germany and Austria has not been agreed upon But even given a more 
 prompt solution of these difficult problems the rehabilitation of the economic structure of 
 Europe quite evidently will require a much longer time and greater effort than had been 
 foreseen 
 There is a phase of this matter which is both interesting and serious The farmer has always 
 produced the foodstuffs to exchange with the city dweller for the other necessities of life This 
 division of labor is the basis of modern civilization At the present time it is threatened with 
 breakdown The town and city industries are not producing adequate goods to exchange with 
 the food producing farmer Raw materials and fuel are in short supply 
 Machinery as I have said is lacking or worn out The farmer or the peasant can not find the 
 goods for sale which he desires to purchase So the sale of his farm produce for money which 
 he can not use seems to him an unprofitable transaction He therefore has withdrawn many 
 fields from crop cultivation and he 's using them for grazing He feeds more grain to stock and 
 finds for himself and his family an ample supply of food however short he may be on clothing 
 and the other ordinary gadgets of civilization 
 Meanwhile people in the cities are short of food and fuel and in some places approaching the 
 starvation levels So the governments are forced to use their foreign money and credits to 
 procure these necessities abroad This process exhausts funds which are urgently needed for 
 reconstruction 
  
  
 
                                           
 Thus a very serious situation is rapidly developing which bodes no good for the world The 
 modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in 
 danger of breaking down The truth of the matter is that Europe 's requirements for the next 
 three or four years of foreign food and other essential products principally from America 
 are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional 
 help or face economic social and political deterioration of a very grave character  
 The remedy seems to lie in breaking the vicious circle and restoring the confidence of the 
 people of Europe in the economic future of their own countries and of Europe as a whole The 
 manufacturer and the farmer throughout wide areas must be able and willing to exchange 
 their product for currencies the continuing value of which is not open to question 
 Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances 
 arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned the consequences to the 
 economy of the United States should be apparent to all It is logical that the United States 
 should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the 
 world without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace Our policy is 
 directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and 
 chaos Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit 
 the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist 
 Such assistance I am convinced must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop 
 Any assistance that this Government may render in the future should provide a cure rather 
 than a mere palliative Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find 
 full cooperation I am sure on the part of the United States Government Any government 
 which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countries can not expect help from us 
 Furthermore governments political parties or groups which seek to perpetuate human 
 misery in order to profit there from politically or otherwise will encounter the opposition of the 
 United States 
 It is already evident that before the United States Government can proceed much further in its 
 efforts to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on its way to recovery 
 there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to the requirements of the 
 situation and the part those countries themselves will take in order to give a proper effect to 
 whatever actions might be   It would be neither fitting nor 
 efficacious for our Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to 
 place Europe on its feet economically This is the business of the Europeans The initiative I 
 think must come from Europe 
  
  
 
                                           
 The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program 
 and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so The 
 program should be a joint one agreed if not all European nations 
 An essential part of any successful action on the part of the United States is an understanding 
 on the part of the people of America of the character of the problem and the remedies to be 
 applied Political passion and prejudice should have no part With foresight and a willingness 
 on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed 
 upon our country the difficulties I have outlined can and will be overcome  
 I am sorry that on each occasion I have said something publicly in regard to our international 
 situation I have been   of the case to enter into rather technical 
 discussions But to my mind it is of vast importance that our people reach some general 
 understanding of what the complications really are rather than react from a passion or a 
 prejudice or an emotion of the moment 
 As I said more formally a moment ago we are remote from the scene of these troubles It is 
 virtually impossible at this distance  listening or even seeing 
 photographs and motion pictures to grasp at all the real significance of the situation And yet 
 the whole world of the future hangs on a proper judgment It hangs I think to a large extent 
 on the realization of the American people of just what are the various dominant factors What 
 are the reactions of the people What are the justifications of those reactions What are the 
 sufferings What is needed What can best be done What must be done

16,John F. Kennedy,Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association,1960," 
 
 
 Reverend Meza Reverend Reck I 'm grateful for your generous invitation to state my views  
 While the so called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight I 
 want to emphasize from the outset that I believe that we have far more critical issues in the 
 1960 campaign the spread of Communist influence until it now festers only 90 miles from 
 the coast of Florida the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those 
 who no longer respect our power the hungry children I saw in West Virginia the old people 
 who can not pay their doctors bills the families forced to give up their farms an America 
 with too many slums with too few schools and too late to the moon and outer space These 
 are the real issues which should decide this campaign And they are not religious issues for 
 war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier  
 But because I am a Catholic and no Catholic has ever been elected President the real issues 
 in this campaign have been obscured perhaps deliberately in some quarters less 
 responsible than this So it is apparently necessary for me to state once again not what 
 kind of church I believe in for that should be important only to me but what kind of 
 America I believe in  
  
  
 
                 
      
      
       
       
 I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute where no 
 Catholic prelate would tell the President should he be Catholic how to act and no 
 Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church 
 school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public 
 office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the 
 people who might elect him  
 I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic Protestant nor Jewish where no 
 public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the Pope the 
 National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks 
 to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its 
 officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated 
 as an act against all  
 For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed in 
 other years it has been and may someday be again a Jew or a Quaker or a Unitarian or 
 a Baptist It was Virginia 's harassment of Baptist preachers for example that led to 
 Jefferson 's statute of religious freedom Today I may be the victim but tomorrow it may be 
 you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great 
 national peril  
 Finally I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end where all men 
 and all churches are treated as equals where every man has the same right to attend or not 
 to attend the church of his choice where there is no Catholic vote no anti Catholic vote no 
 bloc voting of any kind and where Catholics Protestants and Jews at both the lay and the 
 pastoral levels will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often 
 marred their works in the past and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood  
 That is the kind of America in which I believe And it represents the kind of Presidency in 
 which I believe a great office that must be neither   the instrument of 
 any religious group nor   it its occupancy from the 
 members of any one religious group I believe in a President whose views on religion are his 
 own private affair neither imposed upon nor   upon 
 him1 as a condition to holding that office 
 
  
  
 
                 
      
      
       
       
 I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the first amendment 's 
 guarantees of religious liberty nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do 
 so And neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the 
  religious test  if they disagree with that 
 safeguard they should be openly working to repeal it  
 I want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none who 
 can attend any ceremony service or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to 
 fulfill and whose fulfillment of his Presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any 
 religious oath ritual or obligation  
 This is the kind of America I believe in and this is the kind of America I fought for in the 
 South Pacific and the kind my brother died for in Europe No one suggested then that we 
 might have a divided loyalty that we did not believe in liberty or that we belonged to a 
 disloyal group that threatened I quote the freedoms for which our forefathers died  
 And in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers did die when they fled here to 
 escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when 
 they fought for the Constitution the Bill of Rights the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom 
 and when they fought at the shrine I visited today the Alamo For   Bowie and 
 Crockett died Fuentes and McCafferty and Bailey and Badillo and Carey but no one 
 knows whether they were Catholics or not For there was no religious test there  
 I ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge me on the basis of 14 years in the 
 Congress on my declared stands against an Ambassador to the Vatican against 
 unconstitutional aid to parochial schools and against any boycott of the public schools 
 which I attended myself And instead of doing this do not judge me on the basis of these 
 pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context 
 from the statements of Catholic church leaders usually in other countries frequently in other 
 centuries and rarely relevant to any situation here And always omitting of course the 
 statement of the American Bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed Church State separation 
 and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic  
 I do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts Why should you  
 But let me say with respect to other countries that I am wholly opposed to the State being 
  group Catholic or Protestant to compel prohibit or prosecute the free 
 exercise of any other religion And that goes for any persecution at any  
  
  
 
                 
      
      
       
       
 any country   And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny 
 their Presidency to Protestants and those which deny it to Catholics And rather than cite the 
 misdeeds of those who differ I would also cite the record of the Catholic Church in such 
 nations as France and Ireland and the independence of such statesmen as De Gaulle and 
 Adenauer  
 But let me stress again that these are my views  
 For contrary to common newspaper usage I am not the Catholic candidate for President  
 I am the Democratic Party 's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic  
 I do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me 
 Whatever issue may come before me as President if I should be elected on birth control 
 divorce censorship gambling or any other subject I will make my decision in accordance 
 with these views in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national 
 interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates And no power or threat 
 of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise  
 But if the time should ever come and I do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible 
 when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national 
 interest then I would resign the office and I hope any conscientious public servant would do 
 likewise  
 But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant 
 faith nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election  
 If I should lose on the real issues I shall return to my seat in the Senate satisfied that I 'd 
 tried my best and was fairly judged  
 But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being 
 President on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser in 
 the eyes of Catholics and non Catholics around the world in the eyes of history and in the 
 eyes of our own people  
 
  
  
 
                 
      
      
       
       
 But if on the other hand I should win this election then I shall devote every effort of mind 
 and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency practically identical I might add with the 
 oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress For without reservation I can solemnly 
 swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the 
 best of my ability preserve protect and defend the Constitution so help me God

17,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,Commonwealth Club Address,1932," 
 
 My friends 
 I count it a privilege to be invited to address the Commonwealth Club It has stood in the life 
 of this city and state and it is perhaps accurate to add the nation as a group of citizen 
 leaders interested in fundamental problems of government and chiefly concerned with 
 achievement of progress in government through non partisan means The privilege of 
 addressing you therefore in the heat of a political campaign is great I want to respond to 
 your courtesy in terms consistent with your policy 
 I want to speak not of politics but of government I want to speak not of parties but of 
 universal principles They are not political except in that larger sense in which a great 
 American once expressed a definition of politics that nothing in all of human life is foreign to 
 the science of politics 
 The issue of government has always been whether individual men and women will have to 
 serve some system of government of economics or whether a system of government and 
 economics exists to serve individual men and women This question has persistently 
 dominated the discussion of government for many generations 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 On questions relating to these things men have differed and for time immemorial it is 
 probable that honest men will continue to differ 
 The final word belongs to no man yet we can still believe in change and in progress 
 Democracy as a dear old friend of mine in Indian Meredith Nicholson has called it is a 
 quest a never ending seeking for better things and in the seeking for these things and the 
 striving for better things and in the seeking for these things and the striving for them there 
 are many roads to follow But if we map the course of these roads we find that there are 
 only two general directions 
 When we look about us we are likely to forget how hard people have worked to win the 
 privilege of government The growth of the national governments of Europe was a struggle for 
 the development of a centralized force in the nation strong enough to impose peace upon 
 ruling barons In many instances the victory of the central government the creation of a 
 strong central government was a haven of refuge to the individual The people preferred the 
 master far away to the exploitation and cruelty of the smaller master near at hand 
 But the creators of national government were perforce ruthless men They were often cruel in 
 their methods but they did strive steadily toward something that society needed and very 
 much wanted a strong central state able to keep the peace to stamp out civil war to put the 
 unruly nobleman in his place and to permit the bulk of individuals to live safely The man of 
 ruthless force had his place in developing a pioneer country just as he did in fixing the power 
 of the central government in the development of nations Society paid him well for his 
 services and its development When the development among the nations of Europe however 
 has been completed ambition and ruthlessness having served its term tended to overstep its 
 mark 
 There came a growing feeling that government was conducted for the benefit of a few who 
 thrived unduly at the expense of all The people sought a balancing a limiting force There 
 came gradually through town councils trade guilds national  
 by popular participation and control limitations on arbitrary power 
 Another factor that tended to limit the power of those who ruled was the rise of the ethical 
 conception that a ruler bore a responsibility for the welfare of his subjects 
 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 The American colonies were born in this struggle The American Revolution was a turning 
 point in it After the revolution the struggle continued and shaped itself in the public life of the 
 country There were those who because they had seen the confusion which attended the years 
 of war for American independence surrendered to the belief that popular government was 
 essentially dangerous and essentially unworkable They were honest people my friends and 
 we can not deny that their experience had warranted some measure of fear The most brilliant 
 honest and able exponent of this point of view was Hamilton He was too impatient of slow 
 moving methods Fundamentally he believed that the safety of the republic lay in the 
 autocratic strength of its government that the destiny of individuals was to serve that 
 government and that fundamentally a great and strong group of central institutions guided 
 by a small group of able and public spirited citizens could best direct all government 
 But Mr. Jefferson in the summer of 1776 after drafting the Declaration of Independence 
 turned his mind to the same problem and took a different view He did not deceive himself 
 with outward forms Government to him was a means to an end not an end in itself it might 
 be either a refuge and a help or a threat and a danger depending on the circumstances We 
 find him carefully analyzing the society for which he was to organize a government 
 We have no paupers The great mass of our population is of laborers our rich who 
 can not live without labor either manual or professional being few and of moderate 
 wealth Most of the laboring class possess property cultivate their own lands have 
 families and from the demand for their labor are enabled to exact from the rich and 
 the competent such prices as enable them to feed abundantly clothe above mere 
 decency to labor moderately and raise their families.1 
 These people he considered had two sets of rights those of personal competency and 
 those involved in acquiring and possessing property By personal competency he meant the 
 right of free thinking freedom of forming and expressing opinions and freedom of personal 
 living each man according to his own lights To insure the first set of rights a government 
 must so order its functions as not to interfere with the individual But even Jefferson realized 
 that the exercise of the property rights might so interfere with the rights of the individual that 
 the government without whose assistance the property rights could not exist must intervene 
 not to destroy individualism but to protect it 
 You are familiar with the great political duel which followed and how Hamilton and his 
 friends building towards a dominant centralized power were at length defeated in the great 
 election of 1800 by Mr. Jefferson ’s party Out of that duel came the two parties Republican 
 and Democratic as we know them today 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 So began in American political life the new day the day of the individual against the system 
 the day in which individualism was made the great watchword of American life The happiest 
 of economic conditions made that day long and splendid On the Western frontier land was 
 substantially free No one who did not shirk the task of earning a living was entirely without 
 opportunity to do so Depressions could and did come and go but they could not alter the 
 fundamental fact that most of the people lived   labor and partly by 
 extracting their livelihood from the soil so that starvation and dislocation were practically 
 impossible At the very worst there was always the possibility of climbing into a covered 
 wagon and moving west where the untilled prairies afforded a haven for men to whom the 
 East did not provide a place So great were our natural resources that we could offer this relief 
 not only to our own people but to the distressed of all the world we could invite immigration 
 from Europe and welcome it with open arms Traditionally when a depression came a new 
 section of land was opened in the West and even our temporary misfortune served our 
 manifest destiny 
 It was the middle of the 19th century that a new force was released and a new dream 
 created The force was what is called the industrial revolution the advance of steam and 
 machinery and the rise of the forerunners of the modern industrial plant The dream was the 
 dream of an economic machine able to raise the standard of living for everyone to bring 
 luxury within the reach of the humblest to annihilate   and later by 
 electricity and to release everyone from the drudgery of the heaviest manual toil It was to be 
 expected that this would necessarily affect government Heretofore government had merely 
 been called upon to produce conditions within which people could live happily labor 
 peacefully and rest secure Now it was called upon to aid in the consummation of this new 
 dream There was however a shadow over the dream To be made real it required use of 
 the talents of men of tremendous will and tremendous ambition   force could 
 the problems of financing and engineering and new developments be brought to a 
 consummation 
 So manifest were the advantages of the machine age however that the United States 
 fearlessly cheerfully and I think rightly accepted the bitter with the sweet It was thought 
 that no price was too high to pay for the advantages which we could draw from a finished 
 industrial system The history of the last half century is accordingly in large measure a history 
 of a group of financial Titans whose methods were not scrutinized with too much care and 
 who were honored in proportion as they produced the results irrespective of the means they 
 used The financiers who pushed the railroads to the Pacific were always ruthless we have 
 them today It has been estimated that the American investor paid for the American railway 
 system more than three times over in the process but despite that fact the net advantage 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 was to the United States As long as we had free land as long as population was growing by 
 leaps and bounds as long as our industrial plants were insufficient to supply our needs 
 society chose to give the ambitious man free play and unlimited reward provided only that he 
 produced the economic plant so much desired 
 During this period of expansion there was equal opportunity for all and the business of 
 government was not to interfere but to assist in the development of industry This was done 
 at the request of businessmen themselves The tariff was originally imposed for the purpose of 
 fostering our infant industry a phrase I think the older among you will remember as a 
 political issue not so long ago The railroads were subsidized   money 
  land some of the most valuable oil lands in the United States were 
 granted to assist the financing of the railroad which pushed through the Southwest A nascent 
 merchant marine was   money so that our steam 
 shipping might ply the seven seas Some of my friends tell me that they do not want the 
 Government in business With this I agree but I wonder whether they realize the implications 
 of the past For while it has been American doctrine that the government must not go into 
 business in competition with private enterprises still it has been traditional particularly in 
 Republican administrations for business urgently to ask the government to put at private 
 disposal all kinds of government assistance  
 The same man who tells you that he does not want to see the government interfere in 
 business and he means it and has plenty of good reasons for saying so is the first to go 
 to Washington and ask the government for a prohibitory tariff on his product When things get 
 just bad enough as they did two years ago he will go with equal speed to the United 
 States government and ask for a loan and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is the 
 outcome of it 
 Each group has sought protection from the government for its own special interest without 
 realizing that the function of government must be to favor no small group at the expense of 
 its duty to protect the rights of personal freedom and of private property of all its citizens 
 In retrospect we can now see that the turn of the tide came with the turn of the century We 
 were reaching our last frontier there was no more free land and our industrial combinations 
 had become great uncontrolled and irresponsible units of power within the state Clear sighted 
 men saw with fear the danger that opportunity would no longer be equal that the growing 
 corporation like the feudal baron of old might threaten the economic freedom of individuals 
 to earn a living In that hour our antitrust laws were born The cry was raised against the 
 great corporations Theodore Roosevelt the first great Republican progressive fought a 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 Presidential campaign on the issue of trust busting and talked freely about malefactors of 
 great wealth If the government had a policy it was rather to turn the clock back to destroy 
 the large combinations and to return to the time when every man owned his individual small 
 business 
 This was impossible Theodore Roosevelt abandoning the idea of trust busting was forced 
 to work out a difference between good trusts and bad trusts The Supreme Court set forth 
 the famous rule of  seems to have meant that a concentration of industrial 
 power was permissible if the   got its power and the use it made of that 
 power was reasonable 
 Woodrow Wilson elected in 1912 saw the situation more clearly Where Jefferson had feared 
 the encroachment of political power on the lives of individuals Wilson knew that the new 
 power was financial He say in the highly centralized economic system the depot of the 
 twentieth century on whom great masses of individuals relied for their safety and their 
 livelihood and whose irresponsibility and greed if it were not controlled would reduce them 
 to starvation and penury The concentration of financial power had not proceeded so far in 
 1912 as it has today but it had grown far enough for Mr. Wilson to realize fully its 
 implications It is interesting now to read his speeches 
 What is called radical today and I have reason to know whereof I speak is mild compared 
 to the campaign of Mr. Wilson No man can deny he said  
 that the lines of endeavor have more and more narrowed and stiffened no man 
 who knows anything about the development of industry in this country can have 
 failed to observe that the larger kinds of credit are more and more difficult to 
 obtain unless you obtain them upon terms of uniting your efforts with those 
 who already control the industry of the country and nobody can fail to observe 
 that every man who tries to set himself up in competition with any process of 
 manufacture which has taken place under the control of large combinations of 
 capital will presently find himself either squeezed out or obliged to sell and allow 
 himself to be absorbed  
 Had there been no World War had Mr. Wilson been able to devote eight years to domestic 
 instead of to international affairs we might have had a wholly different situation at the 
 present time However the then distant roar of European cannon growing ever louder forced 
 him to abandon the study of this issue The problem he saw so clearly is left with us as a 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 legacy and no one of us on either side of the political controversy can deny that it is a matter 
 of grave concern to the government 
 A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we 
 have know it no longer exists Our industrial plant is built the problem just now is whether 
 under existing conditions it is not overbuilt Our last frontier has long since been reached and 
 there is practically no more free land More than half of our people do not live on the farms or 
 on lands and can not derive a   own property There is no safety valve 
 in the form of a Western prairie to which those thrown out of   economic 
 machines can go for a new start We are not able to invite the immigration from Europe to 
 share our endless plenty We are now providing a drab living for our own people 
 Our system of constantly rising tariffs has at last reacted against us to the point of closing our 
 Canadian frontier on the north our European markets on the east many of our Latin 
 American markets to the south and a goodly proportion of our Pacific markets on the west 
 through the retaliatory tariffs of those countries It has forced many of our great industrial 
 institutions who exported their surplus production to such countries to establish plants in 
 such countries within the tariff walls This has resulted in the reduction of the operation of 
 their American plants and opportunity for employment 
 Just as freedom to farm has ceased so also the opportunity in business has narrowed It still 
 is true that men can start small enterprises trusting to native shrewdness and ability to keep 
 abreast of competitors but area after area has been preempted  
 corporations and even in the fields which still have no great concerns the small man starts 
 with a handicap The unfeeling statistics of the past three decades show that the independent 
 business man is running a losing race Perhaps he is forced to the wall perhaps he can not 
 command credit perhaps he is squeezed out in Mr. Wilson ’s  
 corporate competitors as your corner grocery man can tell you  
 Recently a careful study was made of the concentration of business in the United States It 
 showed that our economic life was   hundred odd corporations who 
 controlled two thirds of American industry Ten million small business men divided the other 
 third More striking still it appeared that if the process of concentration goes on at the same 
 rate at the end of another century we shall have all American industry  
 corporations and   hundred men Put plainly we are steering a steady course 
 toward economic oligarchy if we are not there already 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 Clearly all this calls for a reappraisal of values A mere builder of more industrial plants a 
 creator of more railroad systems and organizer of more corporations is as likely to be a 
 danger as a help The day of the great promoter or the financial Titan to whom we granted 
 anything if only he would build or develop is over Our task now is not discovery or 
 exploitation of natural resources or necessarily producing more goods It is the soberer less 
 dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand of seeking to 
 reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production of meeting the problem of under 
 consumption of adjusting production to consumption of distributing wealth and products 
 more equitably of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people The 
 day of enlightened administration has come 
 Just as in older times the central government was first a haven of refuge and then a threat 
 so now in a closer economic system the central and ambitious financial unit is no longer a 
 servant of national desire but a danger I would draw the parallel one step farther We did not 
 think because national government had become a threat in the 18th century that therefore we 
 should abandon the principle of national government Nor today should we abandon the 
 principle of strong economic units called corporations merely because their power is 
 susceptible of easy abuse 
 In other times we dealt with the problem of an unduly ambitious central government by 
 modifying it gradually into a constitutional democratic government So today we are modifying 
 and controlling our economic units 
 As I see it the task of government in its relation to business is to assist the development of 
 an economic declaration of rights an economic constitutional order This is the common task 
 of statesman and business man It is the minimum requirement of a more permanently safe 
 order of things 
 Every man has a right to life and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable 
 living He   crime decline to exercise that right but it may not be denied him 
 We have no actual famine or death our industrial and agricultural mechanism can produce 
 enough and to spare Our government formal and informal political and economic owes to 
 every one an avenue to possess himself of a portion of that plenty sufficient for his needs 
 through his own work 
 
  
  
 
 
       
 
 Every man has a right to his own property which means a right to be assured to the fullest 
 extent attainable in the safety of his savings By no other means can men carry the burdens 
 of those parts of life which in the nature of things afford no chance of labor childhood 
 sickness old age In all thought of property this right is paramount all other property rights 
 must yield to it If in accord with this principle we must restrict the operations of the 
 speculator the manipulator even the financier I believe we must accept the restriction as 
 needful not to hamper individualism but to protect it  
 These two requirements must be satisfied in the  who claim and hold 
 control of the great industrial and financial combinations which dominate so large a pert of our 
 industrial life They have undertaken to be not business men but princes princes of property 
 I am not prepared to say that the system which produces them is wrong I am very clear that 
 they must fearlessly and competently assume the responsibility which goes with the power 
 So many enlightened business men know this that the statement would be little more that a 
 platitude were it not for an added implication 
 This implication is briefly that the responsible heads of finance and industry instead of acting 
 each for himself must work together to achieve the common end They must where 
 necessary sacrifice this or that private advantage and in reciprocal self denial must seek a 
 general advantage It is here that formal government political government if you choose 
 comes in Whenever in the pursuit of this objective the lone wolf the unethical competitor 
 the reckless promoter the Ishmael or Insull whose hand is against every man ’s declines to 
 join in achieving and end recognized as being for the public welfare and threatens to drag the 
 industry back to a state of anarchy the government may properly be asked to apply restraint 
 Likewise should the group ever use its collective power contrary to public welfare the 
 government must be swift to enter and protect the public interest  
 The government should assume the function of economic regulation only as a last resort to 
 be tried only when private initiative with such assistance and 
 balance as government can give has finally failed As yet there has been no final failure 
 because there has been no attempt and I decline to assume that this nation is unable to meet 
 the situation 
 The final term of the high contract was for liberty and the pursuit of happiness We have 
 learnt a great deal of both in the past century We know that individual liberty and individual 
 happiness mean nothing unless both are ordered in the sense that one man ’s meat is not 
 another man ’s poison We know that the old rights of personal competency the right to 
 read to think to speak to choose and live a mode of life must be respected at all hazards  
  
  
 
 
       
 0 
 We know that liberty to do anything which deprives others of those elemental rights is outside 
 the protection of any compact and that government in this regard is the maintenance of a 
 balance within which every individual may have a place if he will take it in which every 
 individual may find safety if he wishes it in which every individual may attain such power as 
 his ability permits consistent with his assuming the accompanying responsibility 
 Faith in America faith in our tradition of personal responsibility faith in our institutions faith 
 in ourselves demands that we recognize the new terms of the old social contract We shall 
 fulfill them as we fulfilled the obligation of the apparent Utopia which Jefferson imagined for 
 us in 1776 and which Jefferson Roosevelt and Wilson sought to bring to realization We must 
 do so lest a rising tide of misery   failure engulf us all 
 But failure is not an American habit and in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder 
 our common load

18,Edward M. Kennedy,Chappaquiddick Address to the People of Massachusetts,1969," 
 
 
 My fellow citizens  
 I have requested this opportunity to talk to the people of Massachusetts about the tragedy 
 which happened last Friday evening This morning I entered a plea of guilty to the charge of 
 leaving the scene of an accident Prior to my appearance in court it would have been 
 im]proper for me to comment on these matters But tonight I am free to tell you what 
 happened and to say what it means to me 
 On the weekend of July 18th I was on Martha 's Vineyard Island participating with my 
 nephew Joe Kennedy as for thirty years my family has participated in the annual 
 Edgartown Sailing Regatta Only reasons of health prevented my wife from accompanying me 
 On Chappaquiddick Island off Martha 's Vineyard I attended on Friday evening July 18th a 
 cook out I had encouraged and helped sponsor for a devoted group of Kennedy campaign 
 secretaries When I left the party around 11:15pm I was   these girls 
 Miss Mary Jo Kopechne Mary Jo was one of the most devoted members of the staff of Senator 
 Robert Kennedy She worked for him for four years and was broken up over his death For this 
 reason and because she was such a gentle kind and idealistic person all of us tried to help 
 her feel that she still had a home with the Kennedy family 
   
 
 
                        
          
          
                 
 
 There is no truth no truth whatever to the widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct 
 that have been leveled at my behavior and hers regarding that evening There has never been 
 a private relationship between us of any kind I know of nothing in Mary Jo 's conduct on that 
 or any other occasion and the same is true of the other girls at that party that would lend 
 any substance to such ugly speculation about their character Nor was I driving under the 
 influence of liquor 
 Little over one mile away the car that I was driving on an unlit road went off a narrow bridge 
 which had no guard rails and was built on a left angle to the road The car overturned in a 
 deep pond and immediately filled with water I remember thinking as the cold water rushed in 
 around my head that I was for certain drowning Then water entered my lungs and I actual 
 felt the sensation of drowning But somehow I struggled to the surface alive 
 I made immediate and repeated efforts to save Mary   the strong and murky 
 current but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm My conduct 
 and conversations during the next several hours to the extent that I can remember them 
 make no sense to me at all 
 Although my doctors informed me that I suffered a cerebral concussion as well as shock I do 
 not seek to escape responsibility for my   blame either on the physical 
 and emotional trauma brought or on anyone else 
 I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately 
 Instead of looking directly for a telephone after lying exhausted in the grass for an 
 undetermined time I walked back to the cottage where the party was being held and 
 requested the help of two friends my cousin Joseph Gargan and Phil Markham and directed 
 them to return immediately to the scene with me this was sometime after midnight in 
 order to undertake a new effort to dive down and locate Miss Kopechne Their strenuous 
 efforts undertaken at some risk to their own lives also proved futile 
 All kinds of scrambled thoughts all of them confused some of them irrational many of 
 them which I can not recall and some of which I would not have seriously entertained under 
 normal circumstances went through my mind during this period 
 They were reflected in the various inexplicable inconsistent and inconclusive things I said 
 and did including such questions as whether the girl might still be alive somewhere out of 
 that immediate area whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the Kennedys 
   
 
 
                        
          
          
                 
 
 whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happened and to delay 
 my report whether somehow the awful weight of this incredible incident might in some way 
 pass from my shoulders I was overcome I 'm frank to  of emotions grief 
 fear doubt exhaustion panic confusion and shock 
 Instructing Gargan and Markham not to alarm Mary Jo 's friends that night I had them take 
 me to the ferry crossing The ferry having shut down for the night I suddenly jumped into the 
 water and impulsively swam across nearly drowning once again in the effort and returned to 
 my hotel about 2:00am and collapsed in my room I remember going out at one point and 
 saying something to the room clerk 
 In the morning with my mind somewhat more lucid I made an effort to call a family legal 
 advisor Burke Marshall from a public telephone on the Chappaquiddick side of the ferry and 
 then belatedly reported the accident to the Martha 's Vineyard police 
 Today as I mentioned I felt morally obligated to plead guilty to the charge of leaving the 
 scene of an accident No words on my part can possibly express the terrible pain and suffering 
 I feel over this tragic incident This last week has been an agonizing one for me and for the 
 members of my family And the grief we feel over the loss of a wonderful friend will remain 
 with us the rest of our lives 
 These events the publicity innuendo and whispers which have surrounded them and my 
 admission of guilt this morning raises the question in my mind of whether my standing among 
 the people of my State has been so impaired that I should resign my seat in the United States 
 Senate If at any time the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their Senator 's 
 character or his ability with or without justification he could not in my opinion 
 adequately perform his duties and should not continue in office 
 The people of this State the State which sent John Quincy Adams and Daniel Webster and 
 Charles Sumner and Henry Cabot Lodge and John Kennedy to the United States Senate are 
 entitled to representation in that   inspire their utmost confidence 
 For this reason I would understand full well why some might think it right for me to resign 
 For me this will be a difficult decision to make 
 It has been seven years since my first election to the Senate You and I share many memories 
 some of them have been glorious some have been very sad The opportunity to work with 
 you and serve Massachusetts has made my life worthwhile 
   
 
 
                        
          
          
                 
 
 And so I ask you tonight the people of Massachusetts to think this through with me In 
 facing this decision I seek your advice and opinion In making it I seek your prayers for 
 this is a decision that I will have finally to make on my own 
 It has been written 
 A man does what he must in spite of personal consequences in spite of obstacles 
 and dangers and pressures and that is the basis of all human morality.1 
 whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience the loss of his 
 friends his fortune his contentment even the esteem of his fellow man each man 
 must decide for himself the course he will follow The stories of the past courage 
 can not supply courage itself For this each man must look into his own soul.2 
 I pray that I can have the courage to make the right decision Whatever is decided whatever 
 the future holds for me I hope that I shall have be able to put this most recent tragedy 
 behind me and make some further contribution to our state and mankind whether it be in 
 public or private life 
 Thank you and good night

19,William Jefferson Clinton,Oklahoma Bombing Memorial Prayer Service Address,1995," 
 
 
 Thank you very much Governor Keating and Mrs. Keating Reverend Graham to the families 
 of those who have been lost and wounded to the people of Oklahoma City who have endured 
 so much and the people of this wonderful state to all of you who are here as our fellow 
 Americans 
 I am honored to be here today to represent the American people But I have to tell you that 
 Hillary and I also come as parents as husband and wife as people who were your neighbors 
 for some of the best years of our lives 
 Today our nation joins with you in grief We mourn with you We share your hope against 
 hope that some may still survive We thank all those who have worked so heroically to save 
 lives and to solve this crime those here in Oklahoma and those who are all across this great 
 land and many who left their own lives to come here to work hand in hand with you We 
 pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured to rebuild this city and to bring to justice 
 those who did this evil 
 
  
  
 
                                      
          
          
              
        
                    
 This terrible sin took the lives of our American family innocent children in that building only 
 because their parents were trying to be good parents as well as good workers citizens in the 
 building going about their daily business and many there who served the rest of us who 
 worked to help the elderly and the disabled who worked to support our farmers and our 
 veterans who worked to enforce our laws and to protect us Let us say clearly they served us 
 well and we are grateful 
 But for so many of you they were also neighbors and friends You saw them at church or the 
 PTA meetings at the civic clubs at the ball park You know them in ways that all the rest of 
 America could not And to all the members of the families here present who have suffered 
 loss though we share your grief your pain is unimaginable and we know that We can not 
 undo it That is God 's work 
 Our words seem small beside the loss you have endured But I found a few I wanted to share 
 today I 've received a lot of letters in these last terrible days One stood out because it came 
 from a young widow and a mother of three whose own husband was murdered with over 200 
 other Americans when Pan Am 103 was shot down Here is what that woman said I should say 
 to you today 
 The anger you feel is valid but you must not allow yourselves to be consumed by it 
 The hurt you feel must not be allowed to turn into hate but instead into the search for 
 justice The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives Instead you must try to 
 pay tribute to your loved   do all the things they left undone thus 
 ensuring they did not die in vain 
 Wise words from one who also knows 
 You have lost too much but you have not lost everything And you have certainly not lost 
 America for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes 
 If ever we needed evidence of that I could only recall the words of Governor and Mrs. 
 Keating 
 If anybody thinks that Americans are mostly mean and selfish they ought to come to 
 Oklahoma If anybody thinks Americans have lost the capacity for love and caring and 
 courage they ought to come to Oklahoma 
  
  
 
                                      
          
          
              
        
                    
 To all my fellow Americans beyond this hall I say one thing we owe those who have 
 sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil They 
 are forces that threaten our common peace our freedom our way of life Let us teach our 
 children that the God of comfort is also the God of righteousness Those who trouble their own 
 house will inherit the wind 1 Justice will prevail  
 Let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear When there is 
 talk of hatred let us stand up and talk against it When there is talk of violence let us stand 
 up and talk against it In the face of death let us honor life As St. Paul admonished us Let us 
 not be  overcome evil with good 2 
 Yesterday Hillary and I had the privilege of speaking with some children of other federal 
 employees children like those who were lost here And one little girl said something we will 
 never forget She said We should all plant a tree in memory of the children So this morning 
 before we got on the plane to come here at the White House we planted that tree in honor of 
 the children of Oklahoma It was a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep 
 enduring roots It embodies the lesson of the Psalms that the life of a good person is like a 
 tree whose leaf does not wither 3 
 My fellow Americans a tree takes a long time to grow and wounds take a long time to heal 
 But we must begin Those who are lost now belong to God Some day we will be with them 
 But until that happens their legacy must be our lives 
 Thank you all and God bless you

20,Hillary Rodham Clinton,Address to the United Nations 4th World Congress on Women,1995," 
 
 
 Thank you very much Gertrude Mongella for your dedicated work that has brought us to this 
 point distinguished delegates and guests 
 I would like to thank the Secretary General for inviting me to be part of this important United 
 Nations Fourth World Conference on Women This is truly a celebration a celebration of the 
 contributions women make in every aspect of life in the home on the job in the community 
 as mothers wives sisters daughters learners workers citizens and leaders 
 It is also a coming together much the way women come together every day in every country 
 We come together in fields and factories in village markets and supermarkets in living rooms 
 and board rooms Whether it is while playing with our children in the park or washing clothes 
 in a river or taking a break at the office water cooler we come together and talk about our 
 aspirations and concern And time and again our talk turns to our children and our families 
 However different we may appear there is far more that unites us than divides us We share 
 a common future and we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new 
 dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world and in so doing bring new strength 
 and stability to families as well 
  
  
 
               
 By gathering in Beijing we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in our 
 lives the lives of women and their families access to education health care jobs and 
 credit the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and to participate fully in the political 
 life of our countries 
 There are some who question the reason for this conference Let them listen to the voices of 
 women in their homes neighborhoods and workplaces There are some who wonder whether 
 the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe Let 
 them look at the women gathered here and at Huairou the homemakers and nurses the 
 teachers and lawyers the policymakers and women who run their own businesses It is 
 conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen look and 
 face the world ’s most pressing problems Was n’t it after all after the women ’s conference in 
 Nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic 
 violence 
 Earlier today I participated in a World Health Organization forum In that forum we talked 
 about ways that government officials NGOs and individual citizens are working to address 
 the health problems of women and girls Tomorrow I will attend a gathering of the United 
 Nations Development Fund for Women There the discussion will focus on local and highly 
 successful programs that give hard working women access to credit so they can improve 
 their own lives and the lives of their families 
 What we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated their 
 families will flourish If women are free from violence their families will flourish If women 
 have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society their families will 
 flourish And when families flourish communities and nations do as well That is why every 
 woman every man every child every family and every nation on this planet does have a 
 stake in the discussion that takes place here 
 Over the past 25 years I have worked persistently on issues relating to women children and 
 families Over the past two and a half years I 've had the opportunity to learn more about the 
 challenges facing women in my own country and around the world 
 I have met new mothers in Indonesia who come together regularly in their village to discuss 
 nutrition family planning and baby care 
 I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that 
 their children can be cared for in safe and nurturing after school centers 
  
  
 
               
 I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now 
 helping to build a new democracy 
 I have met with the leading women of my own hemisphere who are working every day to 
 promote literacy and better health care for children in their countries 
 I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows 
 or rickshaws or thread in order to create a livelihood for themselves and their families 
 I have met the doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who are trying to keep children 
 alive in the aftermath of Chernobyl 
 The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose 
 experiences go unnoticed whose words go unheard Women comprise more than half the 
 world ’s population 70 of the world ’s poor and two thirds of those who are not taught to 
 read and write We are the primary caretakers for most of the world ’s children and elderly Yet 
 much of the work we do is not valued  by historians not by popular 
 culture  
 At this very moment as we sit here women around the world are giving birth raising 
 children cooking meals washing clothes cleaning houses planting crops working on 
 assembly lines running companies and running countries Women also are dying from 
 diseases that should have been prevented or treated They are watching their children 
 succumb to malnutrition   economic deprivation They are being denied 
 the right to go to   They are being forced into 
 prostitution and they are being barred from the bank lending offices and banned from the 
 ballot box 
 Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those 
 who could not As an American I want to speak for those women in my own country women 
 who are raising children on the minimum wage women who ca n’t afford health care or child 
 care women whose lives are  violence in their own homes 
 I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools safe neighborhoods clean 
 air and clean airwaves for older women some of them widows who find that after raising 
 their families their skills and life experiences are not valued in the marketplace for women 
 who are working all night as nurses hotel clerks or fast food chefs so that they can be at 
  
  
 
               
 home during the day with their children and for women everywhere who simply do n’t have 
 time to do everything they are called upon to do each and every day 
 Speaking to you today I speak for them just as each of us speaks for women around the 
 world who are denied the chance to go to school or see a doctor or own property or have a 
 say about the direction of their lives simply because they are women The truth is that most 
 women around the world work both inside and outside the home usually by necessity 
 We need to understand there is no one formula for how women should lead our lives That is 
 why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family Every 
 woman deserves the chance to realize her own God given potential But we must recognize 
 that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected 
 Our goals for this conference to strengthen families and   to 
 take greater control over their own destinies can not be fully achieved unless all governments 
 here and around the world accept their responsibility to protect and promote 
 internationally recognized human rights The The international community has long 
 acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at Vienna that both women and men are entitled to a 
 range of protections and personal freedoms from the right of personal security to the right to 
 determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear No one No one should 
 be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution arrest abuse or 
 torture 
 Tragically women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated Even now in the 
 late 20th century the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict 
 Women and children make up a large majority of the world ’s refugees And when women are 
 excluded from the political process they become even more vulnerable to abuse I believe 
 that now on the eve of a new millennium it is time to break the silence It is time for us to 
 say here in Beijing and for the world to hear that it is no longer acceptable to discuss 
 women ’s rights as separate from human rights 
 These abuses have continued because for too long the history of women has been a history 
 of silence Even today there are those who are trying to silence our words But the voices of 
 this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loudly and clearly 
 It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food or drowned or suffocated or 
 their spines broken simply because they are born girls 
  
  
 
               
 It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution 
 for human greed and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no 
 longer be tolerated 
 It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline set on fire and 
 burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small 
 It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities 
 and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war 
 It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 
 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own   relatives 
 It is a violation of human rights when young girls are   and degrading 
 practice of genital mutilation 
 It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families 
 and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will 
 If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference let it be that human rights are 
 women ’s rights and women ’s rights are human rights once and for all Let us not forget that 
 among those rights are the right to speak freely and the right to be heard 
 Women must enjoy the rights to participate fully in the social and political lives of their 
 countries if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure It is indefensible that 
 many women in nongovernmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference 
 have not been able to attend or have been prohibited from fully taking part 
 Let me be clear Freedom means the right of people to assemble organize and debate 
 openly It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their 
 governments It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them 
 mistreating them or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful 
 expression of their ideas and opinions 
 In my country we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary of Women ’s Suffrage It took 150 
 years after the signing of our Declaration of Independence for women to win the right to vote 
  
  
 
               
 It took 72 years of organized struggle before that happened on the part of many courageous 
 women and men It was one of America ’s most divisive philosophical wars But it was a 
 bloodless war Suffrage was achieved without a shot being fired 
 But we have also been reminded in V J Day observances last weekend of the good that 
 comes when men and women join together to combat the forces of tyranny and to build a 
 better world We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half century We have avoided 
 another world war But we have not solved older deeply rooted problems that continue to 
 diminish the potential of half the world ’s population 
 Now it is the time to act on behalf of women everywhere If we take bold steps to better the 
 lives of women we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too 
 Families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support and care Families rely on women 
 for labor in the home And increasingly everywhere families rely on women for income 
 needed to raise healthy children and care for other relatives 
 As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace everywhere in the world as 
 long as girls and women are valued less fed less fed last overworked underpaid not 
 schooled subjected to violence in and outside their homes the potential of the human 
 family to create a peaceful prosperous world will not be realized 
 Let Let this conference be our and the world ’s call to action Let us heed that call so we 
 can create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity every boy and 
 girl is loved and cared for equally and every family has the hope of a strong and stable 
 future That is the work before you That is the work before all of us who have a vision of the 
 world we want to see for our children and our grandchildren 
 The time is now We must move beyond rhetoric We must move beyond recognition of 
 problems to working together to have the comment efforts to build that common ground we 
 hope to see  
 God 's blessing on you your work and all who will benefit from it  
 Godspeed and thank you very much",0.0120937870815396,0.0073094889521598,0.0144761083647608,0.8272497653961182,0.1213958114385604,0.0049544489011168,0.0125206094235181,0.1033344003414426,0.3771856664462297,52.77688246097338,0.2949061662198391,0.008345428156748911,0.10663308144416457,0.050101010101010104,27.56,1.0
21,Lyndon Baines Johnson,Let Us Continue,1963," 
 
 
 Mr. Speaker Mr. President Members of the House Members of the Senate my fellow 
 Americans  
 All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today  
 The greatest leader of our time has been struck   deed of our time Today 
 John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind He lives 
 on in the mind and memories of mankind He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen No 
 words are sad enough to express our sense of loss No words are strong enough to express 
 our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began 
 The dream of conquering the vastness of space the dream of partnership across the Atlantic 
 and across the Pacific as well the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations the 
 dream of education for all of our children the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need 
 them the dream of care for our elderly the dream of an all out attack on mental illness and 
 above all the dream of equal rights for all Americans whatever their race or color These and 
 other American dreams have been    And now the 
 ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective 
 action 
  
  
 
                                        
 Under John Kennedy 's leadership this nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to 
 seek peace and it has the fortitude to risk war We have proved that we are a good and 
 reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom We have shown that we can also be a 
 formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us 
 or our allies the yoke of tyranny This nation will keep its commitments from South Vietnam to 
 West Berlin We will be unceasing in the search for peace resourceful in our pursuit of areas 
 of agreement even with those with whom we differ and generous and loyal to those who 
 join with us in common cause 
 In this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war we must recognize the 
 obligation to match national strength with national restraint We must be prepared at one and 
 the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power We must be 
 ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest This is the path 
 that we shall continue to pursue Those who test our courage will find it strong and those who 
 seek our friendship will find it honorable We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be 
 just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice 
 And let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution We will carry 
 on the fight against poverty and misery and disease and ignorance in other lands and in 
 our own We will serve all the nation not one section or one sector or one group but all 
 Americans 
 These are the United States A united people with a united purpose 
 Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity We have differences but now as in the 
 past we can derive from those differences strength not weakness wisdom not despair Both 
 as a people and a government we can unite upon a program a program which is wise and 
 just enlightened and constructive 
 For 32 years Capitol Hill has been my home I have shared many moments of pride with you 
 pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States to act to meet any crisis to distill 
 from our differences strong programs of national action An assassin 's bullet has thrust upon 
 me the awesome burden of the Presidency I am here today to say I need your help I can not 
 bear this burden alone I need the help of all Americans and all America 
 
  
  
 
                                        
 This nation has experienced a profound shock and in this critical moment it is our duty 
 yours and mine as the Government of the United States to do away with uncertainty and 
 doubt and delay and to show that we are capable of decisive action that from the brutal loss 
 of our leader we will derive not weakness but strength that we can and will act and act now 
 From this chamber of representative government let all the world know and none 
 misunderstand that I rededicate this Government to the unswerving support of the United 
 Nations to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies to the 
 maintenance of military strength second to none to the defense of the strength and the 
 stability of the dollar to the expansion of our foreign trade to the reinforcement of our 
 programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asia and Africa and to our Alliance for 
 Progress in this hemisphere 
 On the 20th day of January in 19 and 61 John F. Kennedy told his countrymen that our 
 national work would not be finished in the first thousand days nor in the life of this 
 administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet But he said let us begin 
 Today in this moment of new resolve I would say to all my fellow Americans let us continue  
 This is our challenge not to hesitate not to pause not to turn about and linger over this evil 
 moment but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set 
 for us 
 Our most immediate tasks are here on this Hill First no memorial oration or eulogy could 
 more eloquently honor President Kennedy 's memory than the earliest possible passage of the 
 Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long We have talked long enough in this country about 
 equal rights We have talked for a hundred years or more It is time now to write the next 
 chapter and to write it in the books of law I urge you again as I did in 19 and 57 and again 
 in 19 and 60 to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this 
 nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color There 
 could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad 
 And second no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than 
 the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year This is a bill designed to 
 increase our national income and Federal revenues and to provide insurance against 
 recession That bill if passed without delay means more security for those now working 
 more jobs for those now without them and more incentive for our economy 
  
  
 
                                        
 In short this is no time for delay It is a time for action strong forward looking action on 
 the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in 
 America strong forward looking action on youth employment opportunities strong forward- 
 looking action on the pending foreign aid bill making clear that we are not forfeiting our 
 responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world nor erasing Executive flexibility in the 
 conduct of our foreign affairs and strong prompt and forward looking action on the 
 remaining appropriation bills 
 In this new spirit of action the Congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the 
 executive branch And in particular I pledge that the expenditures of your Government will 
 be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality I will insist that the Government get a 
 dollar 's value for a dollar spent The Government will set an example of prudence and 
 economy 
 This does not mean that we will not meet our unfilled needs or that we will not honor our 
 commitments We will do both 
 As one who has long served in both Houses of the Congress I firmly believe in the 
 independence and the integrity of the legislative branch And I promise you that I shall always 
 respect this It is deep in the marrow of my bones With equal firmness I believe in the 
 capacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress despite the divisions of opinions which 
 characterize our nation to act to act wisely to act vigorously to act speedily when the 
 need arises 
 The need is here The need is now I ask your help 
 We meet in grief but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor Let us meet 
 in action in tolerance and in mutual understanding 
 John Kennedy 's death commands what his life conveyed that America must move forward 
 The time has come for Americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand 
 and to respect one another So let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate 
 and evil and violence Let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right from 
 the apostles of bitterness and bigotry from those defiant of law and those who pour venom

22,Richard M. Nixon,The Great Silent Majority,1969," 
 
 
 Good evening my fellow Americans 
 Tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many 
 people in all parts of the world the war in Vietnam 
 I believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans 
 have lost confidence in what their Government has told them about our policy The American 
 people can not and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding 
 issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy 
 Tonight therefore I would like to answer some of the questions that I know are on the minds 
 of many of you listening to me 
 How and why did America get involved in Vietnam in the first place 
 How has this administration changed the policy of the previous Administration 
  
  
 
               
         
 What has really happened in the negotiations in Paris and on the battlefront in Vietnam 
 What choices do we have if we are to end the war 
 What are the prospects for peace 
 Now let me   situation I found when I was inaugurated on January 
 20 The war had been going on for four years Thirty one thousand Americans had been killed 
 in action The training program for the South Vietnamese was beyond behind schedule Five 
 hundred and forty thousand Americans were in Vietnam with no plans to reduce the number 
 No progress had been made at the negotiations in Paris and the United States had not put 
 forth a comprehensive peace proposal 
 The war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends as well as 
 our enemies abroad 
 In view of these circumstances there were some who urged that I end the war at once by 
 ordering the immediate withdrawal of all American forces From a political standpoint this 
 would have been a popular and easy course to follow After all we became involved in the war 
 while my predecessor was in office I could blame the defeat which would be the result of my 
 action on him and come out as the peacemaker Some put it to me quite bluntly This was 
 the only way to avoid allowing Johnson ’s war to become Nixon ’s war 
 But I had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of my Administration and of the 
 next election I had to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation and on the 
 future of peace and freedom in America and in the world 
 Let us all understand that the question before us is not whether some Americans are for peace 
 and some Americans are against peace The question at issue is not whether Johnson ’s war 
 becomes Nixon ’s war The great question is How can we win America ’s peace 
 Well let us turn now to the fundamental issue Why and how did the United States become 
 involved in Vietnam in the first place Fifteen years ago North Vietnam with the logistical 
 support of Communist China and the Soviet Union launched a campaign to impose a 
 Communist government on South  
 
  
  
 
               
         
 In response to the request of the Government of South Vietnam President Eisenhower sent 
 economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of South Vietnam in their efforts to 
 prevent a Communist takeover Seven years ago President Kennedy sent 16,000 military 
 personnel to Vietnam as combat advisers Four years ago President Johnson sent American 
 combat forces to South Vietnam 
 Now many believe that President Johnson ’s decision to send American combat forces to South 
 Vietnam was wrong And many others I among them have been strongly critical of the way 
 the war has been conducted 
 But the question facing us today is Now that we are in the war what is the best way to end 
 it 
 In January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of all American forces from 
 Vietnam would be a disaster not only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the 
 cause of peace 
 For the South Vietnamese our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the Communists 
 to repeat the massacres which followed their takeover in the North 15 years before They then 
 murdered more than 50,000 people and hundreds of thousands more died in slave labor 
 camps 
 We saw a prelude of what would happen in South Vietnam when the Communists entered the 
 city of Hue last year During their brief rule there there was a bloody reign of terror in which 
 3,000 civilians were clubbed shot to death and buried in mass graves 
 With the sudden collapse of our support these atrocities at Hue would become the nightmare 
 of the entire nation and particularly for the million and a half Catholic refugees who fled to 
 South Vietnam when the Communists took over in the North 
 For the United States this first defeat in our nation ’s history would result in a collapse of 
 confidence in American leadership not only in Asia but throughout the world 
 Three American Presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in Vietnam and 
 understood what had to be done 
 
  
  
 
               
         
 In 1963 President Kennedy with his characteristic eloquence and clarity said 
 we want to see a stable Government there carrying on the a struggle to maintain 
 its national independence We believe strongly in that We are not going to withdraw 
 from that effort In my opinion for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a 
 collapse not only of South Vietnam but Southeast Asia So we ’re going to stay there.1 
 President Eisenhower and President Johnson expressed the same conclusion during their 
 terms of office 
 For the future of peace precipitate withdrawal would be a disaster of immense magnitude A 
 nation can not remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends Our defeat and 
 humiliation in South Vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the councils of 
 those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of worlds conquest This would 
 spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace in the Middle East in 
 Berlin eventually even in the Western Hemisphere Ultimately this would cost more lives It 
 would not bring peace It would bring more war 
 For these reasons I rejected the recommendation that I should end the war by immediately 
 withdrawing all of our forces I chose instead to change American policy on both the 
 negotiating front and the battle front in order to end the war fought on many fronts I initiated 
 a pursuit for peace on many fronts In a television speech on May 14 in a speech before the 
 United Nations on a number of other occasions I set forth our peace proposals in great 
 detail   
 We have offered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year We have 
 proposed a cease fire under international supervision We have offered free elections under 
 international supervision with the Communists participating in the organization and conduct of 
 the elections as an organized political force And the Saigon government has pledged to 
 accept the result of the election 
 We have not put forth our proposals on a take it or leave it basis We have indicated that 
 we ’re willing to discuss the proposals that have been put   side We have 
 declared that anything is negotiable except the right of the people of South Vietnam to 
 determine their own future 
 
  
  
 
               
         
 At the Paris peace conference Ambassador Lodge has demonstrated our flexibility and good 
 faith in 40 public meetings Hanoi has refused even to discuss our proposals They demand 
 our unconditional acceptance of their terms which are that we withdraw all American forces 
 immediately and unconditionally and that we overthrow the government of South Vietnam as 
 we leave 
 We have not limited our peace initiatives to public forums and public statements I recognized 
 in January that a long and bitter war like this usually can not be settled in a public forum That 
 is why in addition to the public statements and negotiations I have explored every possible 
 private avenue that might lead to a settlement 
 Tonight I am taking the unprecedented step of disclosing to you some of our other initiatives 
 for peace initiatives we undertook privately and secretly because we thought we thereby 
 might open a door which publicly would be closed 
 I did not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace Soon after my election 
 through an individual who was directly in contact on a personal basis with the leaders of North 
 Vietnam I made two private offers for a rapid comprehensive settlement Hanoi ’s replies 
 called in effect for our surrender before negotiations Since the Soviet Union furnishes most of 
 the military equipment for North Vietnam Secretary of State Rogers my assistant for national 
 security affairs Dr. Kissinger Ambassador Lodge and I personally have met on a number of 
 occasions with representatives of the Soviet Government to enlist their assistance in getting 
 meaningful negotiations started In addition we have had extended discussions directed 
 toward that same end with representatives of other governments which have diplomatic 
 relations with North Vietnam 
 None of these initiatives have to date produced results In mid July I became convinced that it 
 was necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the Paris talks I spoke directly 
 in this office where I ’m now sitting with an individual who had known Ho Chi Minh on a 
 personal basis for 25 years Through him I sent a letter to Ho Chi Minh I did this outside of 
 the usual diplomatic channels with the hope that with the necessity of making statements for 
 propaganda removed there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an 
 end 
 Let me read from that letter to you now 
 
  
  
 
               
         
 Dear Mr. President  
 I realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four years of 
 war But precisely because of this gulf I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm in 
 all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace I deeply believe that the war in 
 Vietnam has gone on too long and delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one 
 least of all the people of Vietnam The time has come to move forward at the 
 conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war You will find us 
 forthcoming and open minded in a common effort to bring the blessings of peace to 
 the brave people of Vietnam Let history record that at this critical juncture both sides 
 turned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war 
 I received Ho Chi Minh ’s reply on August 30 three days before his death It simply reiterated 
 the public position North Vietnam had taken at Paris and flatly rejected my initiative The full 
 text of both letters is being released to the press 
 In addition to the public meetings that I have referred to Ambassador Lodge has met with 
 Vietnam ’s chief negotiator in Paris in 11 private sessions And we have taken other significant 
 initiatives which must remain secret to keep open some channels of communications which 
 may still prove to be productive 
 But the effect of all the public private and secret negotiations which have been undertaken 
 since the bombing halt a year ago and since this Administration came into office on January 
 20th can be summed up in one sentence No progress whatever has been made except 
 agreement on the shape of the bargaining table 
 Well now who ’s at fault   It ’s become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war 
 is not the President of the United States It is not the South Vietnamese Government The 
 obstacle is the other side ’s absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join us in seeking 
 a just peace And it will not do so while it is convinced that all it has to do is to wait for our 
 next concession and our next concession after that one until it gets everything it wants 
 There can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depends only on Hanoi 
 ’s deciding to negotiate to negotiate seriously I realize that this report on our efforts on the 
 diplomatic front is discouraging to the American people but the American people are entitled 
 to know the truth the bad news as well as the good news where the lives of our young 
 men are involved 
  
  
 
               
         
 Now let me turn however to a more encouraging report on another front At the time we 
 launched our search for peace I recognized we might not succeed in bringing an end to the 
 war through negotiations I therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace a plan 
 which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on the negotiating front It is in 
 line with the major shift in U. S. foreign policy which I described in my press conference at 
 Guam on July 25 Let me briefly explain what has been described as the Nixon Doctrine a 
 policy which not only will help end the war in Vietnam but which is an essential element of our 
 program to prevent future Vietnams 
 We Americans are a do it yourself people we ’re an impatient people Instead of teaching 
 someone else to do a job we like to do it ourselves And this trait has been carried over into 
 our foreign policy In Korea and again in Vietnam the United States furnished most of the 
 money most of the arms and most of the men to help the people of those countries defend 
 their freedom against Communist aggression 
 Before any American troops were committed to Vietnam a leader of another Asian country 
 expressed this opinion to me when I was traveling in Asia as a private citizen He said When 
 you are trying to assist another nation defend its freedom U.S. policy should be to help them 
 fight the war but not to fight the war for them 
 Well in accordance with this wise counsel I laid down in Guam three principles as guidelines 
 for future American policy toward Asia First the United States will keep all of its treaty 
 commitments Second we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a 
 nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security Third in 
 cases involving other types of aggression we shall furnish military and economic assistance 
 when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments But we shall look to the nation 
 directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its 
 defense 
 After I announced this policy I found that the leaders of the Philippines Thailand Vietnam 
 South Korea other nations which might be welcomed 
 this new direction in American foreign policy 
 The defense of freedom is everybody ’s business not just America ’s business   And it is 
 particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is threatened In the previous 
 Administration we Americanized the war in Vietnam In this Administration we are 
 Vietnamizing the search for peace 
  
  
 
               
         
 The policy of the previous Administration not only resulted in our assuming the primary 
 responsibility for fighting the war but even more significant did not adequately stress the goal 
 of strengthening the South Vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left 
 The Vietnamization plan was launched following Secretary Laird ’s visit to Vietnam in 
 March Under the plan I ordered first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of 
 South Vietnamese forces In July on my visit to Vietnam I changed General Abrams ’s orders 
 so that they were consistent with the objectives of our new policies Under the new orders 
 the primary mission of our troops is to enable the South Vietnamese forces to assume the full 
 responsibility for the security of South Vietnam Our air operations have been reduced by over 
 20 per cent 
 And now we have begun to see the results of this long overdue change in American policy in 
 Vietnam After five years of Americans going into Vietnam we are finally bringing American 
 men home By December 15 over 60,000 men will have been withdrawn from South Vietnam 
 including 20 percent of all of our combat forces The South Vietnamese have continued to gain 
 in strength As a result they 've been able to take over combat responsibilities from our 
 American troops 
 Two other significant developments have occurred since this Administration took office Enemy 
 infiltration infiltration which is essential if they are to launch a major attack over the last 
 three months is less than 20 percent of what it was over the same period last year And most 
 important United States casualties have declined during the last two months to the lowest 
 point in three years 
 Let me now turn to our program for the future We have adopted a plan which we have 
 worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. 
 combat ground forces and their   forces on an orderly 
 scheduled timetable This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness As 
 South Vietnamese forces become stronger the rate of American withdrawal can become 
 greater 
 I have not and do not intend to announce the timetable for our program and there are 
 obvious reasons for this decision which I ’m sure you will understand As I ’ve indicated on 
 several occasions the rate of withdrawal will depend on developments on three fronts   One of 
 these is the progress which can be or might be made in the Paris talks An announcement of 
 a fixed timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to 
  
  
 
               
         
 negotiate an agreement They would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and then 
 move in 
 The other two factors on which we will base our withdrawal decisions are the level of enemy 
 activity and the progress of the training programs of the South Vietnamese forces And I am 
 glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these fronts has been greater than we 
 anticipated when we started the program in June for withdrawal As a result our timetable for 
 withdrawal is more optimistic now than when we made our first estimates in June 
 Now this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen in on a fixed timetable We must 
 retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it is at that time 
 rather than on estimates that are no longer valid Along with this optimistic estimate I must 
 in all candor leave one note of caution If the level of enemy activity significantly increases 
 we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly  
 However I want the record to be completely clear on one point At the time of the bombing 
 halt just a year ago there was some confusion as to whether there was an understanding on 
 the part of the enemy that if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam they would stop the 
 shelling of cities in South Vietnam 
 I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to 
 our withdrawal program We have noted the reduced level of infiltration the reduction of our 
 casualties and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially on those factors If the level of 
 infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting it will be 
 the result of a conscious   Hanoi could make no greater mistake than to 
 assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage 
 If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam I shall 
 not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation This is not a 
 threat This is a statement of policy which as Commander in Chief of our armed forces I am 
 making and meeting my responsibility for the protection of American fighting men wherever 
 they may be 
 My fellow Americans I am sure you can recognize from what I have said that we really only 
 have two choices open to us if we want to end this war I can order an immediate precipitate 
 withdrawal of all Americans from Vietnam without regard to the effects of that action Or we 
 can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement if possible or 
 through continued implementation of our plan for Vietnamization if necessary a plan in 
  
  
 
               
         0 
 which we will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our 
 program as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom 
 I have chosen this second course It is not the easy way It is the right way It is a plan which 
 will end the war and serve the cause of peace not just in Vietnam but in the Pacific and in the 
 world 
 In speaking of the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal I mentioned that our allies would 
 lose confidence in America Far more dangerous we would lose confidence in ourselves Oh 
 the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our men were coming home But as we 
 saw the consequences of what we had done inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination 
 would scar our spirit as a people 
 We have faced other crises in our history and we have become   easy 
 way out and taking the right way in meeting our challenges Our greatness as a nation has 
 been our capacity to do what has to be done when we knew our course was right I recognize 
 that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen Honest and 
 patriotic Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved In 
 San Francisco a few weeks ago I saw demonstrators carrying signs reading Lose in Vietnam 
 bring the boys home Well one of the strengths of our free society is that any American has 
 a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view 
 But as President of the United States I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the 
 policy of this nation to be   who hold that point of view and who try to 
 impose it on the   For almost 200 years the 
 policy of this nation has been made under our   in the Congress 
 and the White House   people If a vocal minority however fervent its cause 
 prevails over reason and the will of the majority this nation has no future as a free society 
 And now I would like to address a word if I may to the young people of this nation who are 
 particularly concerned and I understand why they are concerned about this war I respect 
 your idealism I share your concern for peace I want peace as much as you do There are 
 powerful personal reasons I want to end this war This week I will have to sign 83 letters to 
 mothers fathers wives and loved ones of men who have given their lives for America in 
 Vietnam It 's very little satisfaction to me that this is only one third as many letters as I 
 signed the first week in office There is nothing I want more than to see the day come when I 
 do not have to write any of those letters 
  
  
 
               
         1 
 I want to end the war to save the lives of those brave young men in Vietnam But I want to 
 end it in a way which will increase the chance that their younger brothers and their sons will 
 not have to fight in some future Vietnam some place in the world 
 And I want to end the war for another reason I want to end it so that the energy and 
 dedication of you our young people now too often directed into bitter hatred against those 
 responsible for the war can be turned to the great challenges of peace a better life for all 
 Americans a better life for all people on this earth 
 I have chosen a plan for peace I believe it will succeed If it does not succeed what the 
 critics say now wo n’t matter Or if it does succeed what the critics say now wo n’t matter If it 
 does not succeed anything I say then wo n’t matter 
 I know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days but I 
 feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion Two hundred years ago this nation was weak 
 and poor But even then America was the hope of millions in the world Today we have 
 become the strongest and richest nation in the world and the wheel of destiny has turned so 
 that any hope the world has for the survival of peace and freedom will be determined by 
 whether the American people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge 
 of free world leadership 
 Let historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we 
 passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of 
 millions of people to be   of totalitarianism 
 So tonight to you the great silent majority of my fellow Americans I ask for your support I 
 pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the 
 peace I have initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keep that pledge The more 
 support I can have from the American people the sooner that pledge can be redeemed For 
 the more divided we are at home the less likely the enemy is to negotiate at Paris 
 Let us be united for peace Let us also be united against defeat Because let us understand 
 North Vietnam can not defeat or humiliate the United States Only Americans can do that 
 Fifty years ago in this room and at this very desk President Woodrow Wilson spoke words 
 which caught the imagination of a war weary world He said This is the war to end wars  
 His dream for peace after World War I was shattered on the hard reality of great power 
 politics And Woodrow Wilson died a broken man 
  
  
 
               
         2 
 Tonight I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars but I do say this I 
 have initiated a plan which will end this war in a way that will bring us closer to that great 
 goal to which to which Woodrow Wilson and every American President in our history has 
 been dedicated the goal of a just and lasting peace 
 As President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best path for that goal and then leading 
 the nation along it 
 I pledge to you tonight that I shall meet this responsibility with all of the strength and wisdom 
 I can command in accordance with your hopes mindful of your concerns sustained by your 
 prayers 
 Thank you and good night

 Ursula Le Guin 2009 Copyrighted   Kolisch 
 
 I want to thank the Mills College Class of 83 for offering me a rare chance to speak aloud in 
 public in the language of women 
 I know there are men graduating and I do n't mean to exclude them far from it There is a 
 Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner If you do n't understand Greek please 
  commencements are usually operated under the unspoken 
 agreement that everybody graduating is either male or ought to be That ’s why we are all 
 wearing these twelfth century dresses that look so great on men and make women look either 
 like a mushroom or a pregnant stork 
 Intellectual tradition is male Public speaking is done in the public tongue the national or 
 tribal language and the language of our tribe is the men 's language Of course women learn 
 it We 're not dumb If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan or Indira Gandhi 
 from General  say tell me how This is a man ’s world so it talks a 
 man ’s language The words are all words of power You ’ve come a long way baby but no way 
 is long enough You ca n’t even get   out because there is theirs not 
 yours 
  
  
 
           
       
       
                   
            
            
                             
 
 Maybe we ’ve had enough words of power and talk about the battle of life Maybe we need 
 some words of weakness Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go forth from this 
 ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a triumphant career or at least help your 
 husband to and keep our country strong and be a success in everything instead of talking 
 about power what if I talked like a woman right here in public It wo n’t sound right It ’s going 
 to sound terrible What if I said what I hope for you is first if only if you want kids I 
 hope you have them Not hordes of them A couple enough I hope they ’re beautiful I hope 
 you and they have enough to eat and a place to be warm and clean in and friends and work 
 you like doing 
 Well is that what you went to college for Is that all What about success 
 Success is somebody else ’s failure Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming 
 because most people in most places including thirty million of ourselves live wide awake in 
 the terrible reality of poverty No I do not wish you success I do n’t even want to talk about 
 it I want to talk about failure 
 Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure You are going to meet 
 disappointment injustice betrayal and irreparable loss You will find you ’re weak where you 
 thought yourself strong You ’ll work for possessions and then find they possess you You will 
 find yourself as I know you already have in dark places alone and afraid 
 What I hope for you for all my sisters and daughters brothers and sons is that you will be 
 able to live there in the dark place To live in the place that our rationalizing culture of 
 success denies calling it a place of exile uninhabitable foreign 
 Well we ’re already foreigners Women as women are largely excluded from alien to the self- 
 declared male norms of this society where human beings are called Man the only respectable 
 god is male the only direction is up So that ’s their country let ’s explore our own I ’m not 
 talking about sex that ’s a whole other universe where every man and woman is on their 
 own I ’m talking about society the so called man ’s world of institutionalized competition 
 aggression violence authority and power 
 If we want to live as women some separatism is forced upon us Mills College is a wise 
 embodiment of that separatism The war games world was n’t   for us we ca n’t 
 even breathe the air there without masks And if you put the mask on you ’ll have a hard time 
 getting it off 
  
  
 
           
       
       
                   
            
            
                             
 
 So how about going on doing things our own way as to some extent you did here at Mills 
 Not for men and the male power hierarchy that ’s their game Not against men either 
 that ’s still   But with any men who are with us that ’s our game Why 
 should a free woman with a college education either fight Machoman or serve him Why 
 should she live her life on his terms 
 Machoman is afraid of our terms which are not all rational positive competitive etc And so 
 he has taught us to despise and deny them In our society women have lived and have been 
 despised for living the whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for 
 helplessness weakness and illness for the irrational and the irreparable for all that is 
 obscure passive uncontrolled animal unclean the valley of the shadow the deep the 
 depths of life All that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share it 
 with us and therefore like us ca n’t play doctor only nurse ca n’t be warriors only civilians 
 ca n’t be chiefs only indians Well so that is our country The night side of our country If there 
 is a day side to it high sierras prairies of bright grass we only know pioneers tales about it 
 we have n’t got there yet We ’re never going to get   We are only 
 going to get   own  by living through the night in our 
 own country 
 So what I hope for you is that you live there not as prisoners ashamed of being women 
 consenting captives of a psychopathic social system but as natives That you will be at home 
 there keep house there be your own mistress with a room of your own 
 That you will do your work there whatever you ’re good at art or science or tech or running a 
 company or sweeping under the beds and when they tell you that it ’s second class work 
 because a woman is doing it I hope you tell them to go to hell and while they ’re going to give 
 you equal pay for equal time I hope you live without the need to dominate and without the 
 need to be dominated I hope you are never victims but I hope you have no power over other 
 people And when you fail and are defeated and in pain and in the dark then I hope you will 
 remember that darkness is your country where you live where no wars are fought and no 
 wars are won but where the future is 
 Our roots are in the dark the earth is our country Why did we look up for blessing instead 
 of around and down What hope we have lies there Not in the sky full of orbiting spy eyes 
 and weaponry but in the earth we have looked down upon Not from above but from below 
 Not in the light that blinds but in the dark that nourishes where human beings grow human

24,Spiro T. Agnew,TV News Coverage,1969," 
 
 
 Thank you very much Governor Ray Governor Ogilvie Governor Tiemann Mr. Boyd Miss 
 Peterson the many distinguished officials of the Republican Party gathered for this Midwest 
 regional meeting It 's indeed a pleasure for me to be here tonight I had intended to make all 
 three of the regional meetings that have been scheduled thus far but unfortunately I had to 
 scrub the Western one Hawaii was a little far at the moment that time But I 'm glad to be 
 here tonight and I look forward to attending the others 
 I think it 's obvious from the cameras here that I did n't come to discuss the ban on cyclamates 
 or DDT I have a subject I think is of great interest to the American people Tonight I want to 
 discuss the importance of the television medium to the American people No nation depends 
 more on the intelligent judgment of its citizens And no medium has a more profound 
 influence over public opinion Nowhere in our system are there fewer checks on such vast 
 power So nowhere should there be more conscientious responsibility exercised than by the 
 news media The question is Are we demanding enough of our television news 
 presentations And are the men of this medium demanding enough of themselves 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Monday night a week ago President Nixon delivered the most important address of his 
 Administration one of the most important of our decade His subject was Vietnam My hope 
 as his at that time was to rally the American people to see the conflict through to a lasting 
 and just peace in the Pacific For 32 minutes he reasoned with a nation that has suffered 
 almost a third of a million casualties in the longest war in its history 
 When the President completed his address an address incidentally that he spent weeks in 
 the preparation of his words and policies were subjected to instant analysis and querulous 
 criticism The audience of 70 million Americans gathered to hear the President of the United 
 States was   band of network commentators and self appointed analysts 
 the majority of whom expressed in one way or another their hostility to what he had to say 
 It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance Those who recall the fumbling and 
 groping that followed President Johnson 's dramatic disclosure of his intention not to seek 
 another term have seen these men in a genuine state of non preparedness This was not it 
 One commentator twice contradicted the President 's statement about the exchange of 
 correspondence with Ho Chi Minh Another challenged the President 's abilities as a politician A 
 third asserted that the President was following a Pentagon line  on 
 their faces the tone of their questions and the sarcasm of their responses made clear their 
 sharp disapproval 
 To guarantee in advance that the President 's plea for national unity would be challenged one 
 network A.B.C. trotted out Averell Harriman for the occasion Throughout the President 's 
 address he waited in the wings When the President concluded Mr. Harriman recited 
 perfectly He attacked the Thieu Government as unrepresentative He criticized the President 's 
 speech for various deficiencies He twice issued a call to the Senate Foreign Relations 
 Committee to debate Vietnam once again He stated his belief that the Vietcong or North 
 Vietnamese did not really want a military takeover of South Vietnam And he told a little 
 anecdote about a very very responsible fellow he had met in the North Vietnamese 
 delegation.1 
 All in all Mr. Harriman offered a broad range of gratuitous advice challenging and 
 contradicting the policies   of the United States Where the President 
 had issued a call for unity Mr. Harriman was encouraging the country not to listen to him 
 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 A word about Mr. Harriman For 10 months he was America 's chief negotiator at the Paris 
 peace talks a period in which the United States swapped some of the greatest military 
 concessions in the history of warfare for an enemy agreement on the shape of the bargaining 
 table Like Coleridge 's Ancient Mariner Mr. Harriman seems to be under some heavy 
 compulsion to justify his failures to anyone who will listen And the networks have shown 
 themselves willing to give him all the air time he desires 
 Now every American has a right to disagree with the President of the United States and to 
 express publicly that disagreement But the President of the United States has a right to 
 communicate directly with the people who elected him and the people of this country have 
 the right to make up their own minds and form their own opinions about a Presidential 
 address without having the President 's words and thoughts characterized through the 
 prejudices of hostile critics before they can even be digested 
 When Winston Churchill rallied public opinion to stay the course against Hitler 's Germany he 
 did n't have to contend with a gaggle of commentators raising doubts about whether he was 
 reading public opinion right or whether Britain had the stamina to see the war through When 
 President Kennedy rallied a nation in the Cuban missile crisis his address to the people was 
 not chewed   of critics who disparaged the course of action he 'd asked 
 America to follow 
 The purpose of my remarks tonight is to focus your attention on this little group of men who 
 not only enjoy a right of instant rebuttal to every Presidential address but more importantly 
 wield a free hand in selecting presenting and interpreting the great issues in our nation  
 First let 's define that power 
 At least 40 million Americans every night it 's estimated watch the network news Seven 
 million of them view A.B.C. the remainder being divided between N.B.C. and C.B.S. According 
 to Harris polls and other studies for millions of Americans the networks are the sole source of 
 national and world news In Will Rogers observation what you knew was what you read in 
 the newspaper Today for growing millions of Americans it 's what they see and hear on their 
 television sets 
 Now how is this network news determined A small group of men numbering perhaps no 
 more than a dozen anchormen commentators and executive producers settle upon the 20 
 minutes or so of film and commentary that 's to reach the public 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 This selection is made from the 90 to 180 minutes that may be available Their powers of 
 choice are broad They decide what 40 to 50 million Americans will learn of the day 's events in 
 the nation and in the world We can not measure this power and  
 democratic standards for these men can create national issues overnight They can make or 
  and commentary a moratorium on the war They can elevate men 
 from obscurity to national prominence within a week They can reward some politicians with 
 national exposure and ignore others 
 For millions of Americans the network reporter who covers a continuing issue like the ABM 
 or civil rights becomes in effect the presiding judge in a national trial by jury 
 It must be recognized that the networks have made important contributions to the national 
 knowledge through news documentaries and specials They have often used their power 
 constructively and creatively to awaken the public conscience to critical problems The 
 networks made hunger and black lung disease national issues overnight The TV networks 
 have done what no other medium could have done in terms of dramatizing the horrors of war 
 The networks have tackled our most difficult social problems with a directness and an 
 immediacy that 's the gift of their medium 
 They focus the nation 's attention on its environmental abuses on pollution in the Great 
 Lakes and the threatened ecology of the Everglades But it was also the networks that 
 elevated Stokely Carmichael and George Lincoln Rockwell from obscurity to national 
 prominence 
 Nor is their power confined to the substantive A raised eyebrow an inflection of the voice a 
 caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast can raise doubts in a million minds about 
 the veracity of a public official or the wisdom of a Government policy One Federal 
 Communications Commissioner considers the powers of the networks equal to that of local 
 state and Federal Governments all combined Certainly it represents a concentration of power 
 over American public opinion unknown in history 
 Now what do Americans know of the men who wield this power Of the men who produce and 
 direct the network news the nation knows practically nothing Of the commentators most 
 Americans know little other than that they reflect an urbane and assured presence seemingly 
 well informed on every important matter We do know that to a man these commentators and 
 producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington D.C. or 
 New York City the latter of which James Reston terms the most unrepresentative community 
 in the entire United States 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Both communities bask in their own provincialism their own parochialism We can deduce 
 that these men read the same newspapers They draw their political and social views from the 
 same sources Worse they talk constantly to one another thereby providing artificial 
 reinforcement to their shared viewpoints Do they allow their biases to influence the selection 
 and presentation of the news David Brinkley states objectivity is impossible to normal 
 human behavior Rather he says we should strive for fairness p. 219).2 
 Another anchorman on a network news show contends and I quote  
 You ca n't expunge all your private convictions just because you sit in a seat like this 
 and a camera starts to stare at you I think your program has to reflect what your 
 basic feelings are I 'll plead guilty to that.3 
 Less than a week before the 1968 election this same commentator charged that President 
 Nixon 's campaign commitments were no more durable than campaign balloons He claimed 
 that were it not for the fear of the hostile reaction Richard Nixon would be giving into and I 
 quote him exactly his natural instinct to smash the enemy with a club or go after him with a 
 meat axe ""4 
 Had this slander been   candidate about another it would have been 
  as a partisan attack But this attack emanated from the 
 privileged sanctuary of a network studio and therefore had the apparent dignity of an 
 objective statement 
 The American people would rightly not tolerate this concentration of power in Government Is 
 it not fair and relevant to question its concentration in the hands of a tiny enclosed fraternity 
 of privileged men   and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by 
 Government The views of the majority of this fraternity do not and I repeat not 
 represent the views of America And that is why such a great gulf existed between how the 
 nation received the President 's address and how the networks reviewed it 
 Not only did the country receive the President 's address more warmly than the networks but 
 so also did the Congress of the United States Yesterday the President was notified that 300 
 individual Congressmen and 50 Senators of both parties had endorsed his efforts for peace As 
 with other American institutions perhaps it is time that the networks were made more 
 responsive to the views of the nation and more responsible to the people they serve 
 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Now I want to make myself perfectly clear I 'm not asking for Government censorship or any 
 other kind of censorship I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the 
 news that 40 million Americans receive each night is   of men 
 responsible only to their corporate employers and is filtered through a handful of 
 commentators who admit to their own set of biases 
 The questions I 'm raising here tonight should have been   ago They 
 should have been   who have traditionally considered the 
 preservation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press their special provinces of 
 responsibility They should have been   who share the view of the 
 late Justice Learned Hand that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a 
 multitude of tongues than through any kind of authoritative selection ""5 
 Advocates for the networks have claimed a First Amendment right to the same unlimited 
 freedoms   But the situations are not identical Where 
 The New York Times reaches 800,000 people N.B.C. reaches 20 times that number on its 
 evening news Nor can the tremendous impact of seeing television film and hearing 
 commentary be compared with reading the printed page 
 A decade ago before the network news acquired such dominance over public opinion Walter 
 Lippman spoke to the issue He said  
 There is is an essential and radical difference between television and printing The 
 three or four competing television stations control virtually all that can be received 
 over the   sets But besides the mass circulation dailies there 
 are the weeklies the monthlies the out of town newspapers and books If a man 
 does not like his newspaper he can read another from out of town or wait for a 
 weekly news magazine It is not ideal but it is infinitely better than the situation in 
 television There if a man does not like what the networks offer him all he can do 
 is to turn them off and listen to a phonograph p.414).6 
 Networks he stated  
 which are few in number have a virtual monopoly of a whole medium of 
 communication The newspapers of mass circulation have no monopoly of the 
 medium of print p.414).7 
 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Now a virtual monopoly of a whole medium of communication is not something that 
 democratic people should blithely ignore And we are not going to cut off our television sets 
 and listen to the phonograph just because the airways belong to the networks They do n't 
 They belong to the people As Justice Byron White wrote in his landmark opinion six months 
 ago It is the right of the viewers and listeners not the right of the broadcasters which is 
 paramount ""8 
 Now it 's argued that this power presents no danger in the hands of those who have used it 
 responsibly But as to whether or not the networks have abused the power they enjoy let us 
 call as our first witness former Vice President Humphrey and the city of Chicago According to 
 Theodore White television 's intercutting of the film from the streets of Chicago with the 
 current proceedings on the floor of the convention created the most striking and false 
 political picture of 1968 the nomination of a man for the American Presidency by the 
 brutality and violence of merciless police ""9 
 If we are to believe a recent report of the House of Representatives Commerce Committee 
 then television 's presentation of the violence in the streets worked an injustice on the 
 reputation of the Chicago police According to the committee findings one network in 
 particular presented and I quote a one sided picture which in large measure exonerates the 
 demonstrators and protestors ""10 Film of provocations of police that was available never saw 
 the light of day while the film of a police response which the protestors provoked was shown 
 to millions 
 Another network showed virtually the same scene of violence from three separate angles 
 without making clear it was the same scene And while the full report is reticent in drawing 
 conclusions it is not a document to inspire confidence in the fairness of the network news 
 Our knowledge of the impact of network news on the national mind is far from incomplete 
 sic but some early returns are available Again we have enough information to raise serious 
 questions about its effect on a democratic society 
 Several years ago Fred Friendly one of the pioneers of network news wrote that its missing 
 ingredients were conviction controversy and a point of view p.153).11 The networks have 
 compensated with a vengeance 
 And in the networks endless pursuit of controversy we should ask What is the end value 
 to enlighten or to profit What is the end result to inform or to confuse How does the 
 ongoing exploration for more action more excitement more drama serve our national search 
 for internal peace and stability 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Gresham 's Law seems to be operating in the network news Bad news drives out good news 
 The irrational is more controversial than the rational Concurrence can no longer compete with 
 dissent One minute of Eldridge Cleaver is worth 10 minutes of Roy Wilkins The labor crisis 
 settled at the negotiating table is nothing compared to the confrontation that results in a 
 strike or better yet violence along the picket lines Normality has become the nemesis of 
 the network news  
 Now the upshot of all this controversy is that a narrow and distorted picture of America often 
 emerges from the televised news A single dramatic piece of the mosaic becomes in the 
 minds of millions the entire picture The American who relies upon television for his news 
 might conclude that the majority of American students are embittered radicals that the 
 majority of black Americans feel no regard for their country that violence and lawlessness are 
 the rule rather than the exception on the American campus We know that none of these 
 conclusions is true 
 Perhaps the place to start looking for a credibility gap is not in the offices of the Government 
 in Washington but in the studios of the networks in New York Television may have destroyed 
 the old stereotypes but has it not created new ones in their places What has this 
 passionate pursuit of controversy done to the politics of progress through local compromise 
 essential to the functioning of a democratic society 
 The members of Congress or the Senate who follow their principles and philosophy quietly in a 
 spirit of compromise are unknown to many Americans while the loudest and most extreme 
 dissenters on every issue are known to every man in the street How many marches and 
 demonstrations would we have if the marchers did not know that the ever faithful TV cameras 
 would be there to record their antics for the next news show 
 We 've heard demands that Senators and Congressmen and judges make known all their 
 financial connections so that the public will know who and what influences their decisions and 
 their votes Strong arguments can be made for that view But when a single commentator or 
 producer night after night determines for millions of people how much of each side of a great 
 issue they are going to see and hear should he not first disclose his personal views on the 
 issue as well In this search for excitement and controversy has more than equal time gone 
 to the minority of Americans who specialize in attacking the United States its institutions 
 and its citizens 
 
  
  
 
                 
        
         
     
     
                                  
 Tonight I 've raised questions I 've made no attempt to suggest the answers The answers 
 must come from the media men They are challenged to turn their critical powers on 
 themselves to direct their energy their talent and their conviction toward improving the 
 quality and objectivity of news presentation They are challenged to structure their own civic 
 ethics to relate their great feeling with the great responsibilities they hold 
 And the people of America are challenged too challenged to press for responsible news 
 presentations 
 The people can let the networks know that they want their news straight and objective The 
 people can register their complaints on bias through mail to the networks and phone calls to 
 local stations This is one case where the people must defend themselves where the citizen 
 not the Government must be the reformer where the consumer can be the most effective 
 crusader 
 By way of conclusion let me say that every elected leader in the United States depends on 
 these men of the media Whether what I 've said to you tonight will be heard and seen at all 
 by the nation is not my decision it 's not your decision it 's their decision 
 In tomorrow 's edition of the Des Moines Register you 'll be able to read a news story detailing 
 what I said tonight Editorial comment will be reserved for the editorial page where it 
 belongs Should not the same wall of separation exist between news and comment on the 
 nation 's networks  
 Now my friends we 'd never trust such power as I 've described over public opinion in the 
 hands of an elected Government It 's time we questioned it in the hands of a small and 
 unelected elite The great networks have dominated America 's airwaves for decades The 
 people are entitled to a full accounting of their stewardship

25,Emma Goldman,Address to the Jury,1917," 
 
 Gentlemen of the Jury 
 As in the case of my co defendant Alexander Berkman this is also the first time in my life I 
 have ever addressed a jury   I once had occasion to speak to three judges 
 On the day after our arrest it was give   Marshal and the District Attorney ’s 
 office that the big fish of the No Conscription activities had been caught and that there 
 would be no more trouble makers and disturbers to interfere with the highly democratic effort 
 of the Government to conscript its young manhood for the European slaughter   What a pity 
 that the faithful servants of the Government personified in the U. S. Marsha land the District 
 Attorney should have used such a weak and flimsy net for their big catch   The moment the 
 anglers pulled their heavily laden net ashore it broke and all the labor was so much wasted 
 energy 
 The methods   and his hosts of heroic warriors were sensational 
 enough to satisfy the famous circus men Barnum Baily   A dozen or more heroes dashing 
 up two flights of stairs prepared to stake their lives for their country only to discover the two 
 dangerous disturbers and trouble makers Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman in their 
 separate offices quietly at work at their desks wielding not a sword nor a gun or a bomb 
 but merely their pens   Verily it required courage to catch such big fish 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 
 To be sure tow officers equipped with a warrant would have sufficed to carry out the business 
 of arresting the defendants Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman   Even the police know 
 that neither of them is in the habit of running away or hiding under the bed   But the farce- 
 comedy had to be properly staged if the Marshal and the District Attorney were to earn 
 immortality   Hence the sensational arrest hence also the raid upon the offices of THE 
 BLAST MOTHER EARTH and the No Conscription League 
 In their zeal to save the country from the trouble makers the Marshal and his helpers did not 
 even consider it necessary to produce a search warrant   After all what matters a mere scrap 
 of paper when one is called upon to raid the offices of Anarchists Of what consequence is the 
 sanctity of property the right of privacy to officials in their dealings with Anarchists   In our 
 day of military training for battle and Anarchist office is an appropriate camping ground  
 Would the gentlemen who came with Marshal McCarthy have dared to go into the offices of 
 Morgan of Rockefeller or of any of those men without a search warrant   They never showed 
 us the search warrant although we asked them for it   Nevertheless they turned our office 
 into a battlefield so that when they were through with it it looked like invaded Belgium with 
 the only difference that the invaders were not Prussian barbarians but good American patriots 
 bent on making New York safe for democracy 
 The stage having been appropriately set for the three act comedy and the first act 
 successfully   the villains in a madly dashing automobile which broke 
 every traffic regulation and barely escaped crushing every one in its way the second act 
 proved even more ludicrous   Fifty thousand dollars bail was demanded and real estate 
 refused when   whose property is rated at three hundred thousand dollars 
 and that after the District Attorney had considered and in fact promised to accept the 
 property for one of the defendants Alexander Berkman thus breaking every right guaranteed 
 even to the most heinous criminal 
 Finally the third act   in this court during the last week   The pity of 
 it is that the prosecution knows so little of dramatic construction else it would have equipped 
 itself with better dramatic material to sustain the continuity of the play   As it was the third 
 act fell flat utterly and presents the question Why such a tempest in a teapot 
 Gentlemen of the jury my comrade and co defendant having carefully and thoroughly gone 
 into the evidence and having demonstrated its entire failure to 
 prove the charge of conspiracy or any overt acts to carry out that conspiracy I shall not 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 impose upon your   the same ground except to emphasize a few 
 points   To charge people with having conspired to do something which they have been 
 engaged in doing most of their lives namely their campaign against war militarism and 
 conscription as contrary to the best interests of humanity is an insult to human intelligence 
 And how was that charge proven 
 By the fact that MOTHER EARTH and THE BLAST were   printer and bound 
 in the same bindery   By the further evidence that the same expressman had delivered to two 
 publications    more illuminating fact that on June 2nd MOTHER EARTH and THE 
 BLAST were given to a reporter at his request if your please and gratis 
 Gentlemen of the jury you saw the reporter who testified to this overt act   Did any one of 
 you receive the impression that the man was of conscriptable age and if not in what possible 
 way is the giving of MOTHER EARTH   to a report for news purposes proof demonstrating the 
 overt act 
 It was brought   that the MOTHER EARTH magazine has been published 
 for twelve years that it was never held up and that it has always gone through the U. S. mail 
 as second class mail matter   It was further proven that the magazine appeared each month 
 about the first or second and that it was sold or given away at the office to whoever wanted a 
 copy   Where then is the overt act 
 Just as the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the charge of conspiracy so has it also 
 failed to prove the overt   testimony that MOTHER EARTH was given to a 
 reporter   The same holds good regarding THE BLAST 
 Gentlemen of the jury the District Attorney must have learned from the reporters the gist of 
 the numerous interviews which they had with us   Why did he not examine them as to 
 whether or not we had counseled young men not to register   That would have been a more 
 direct way of getting at the facts   In the case of the reporter from the New York Times there 
 can be no doubt that the man would have been only too happy to accommodate the District 
 Attorney with the required information   A man who disregards every principle of decency and 
 ethics of his profession as a newspaper  given him as news over to 
 the District Attorney would have been glad to oblige a friend   Why did Mr. Content neglect 
 such a golden opportunity   Was it no because the reporter of the Times like all the other 
 reporters must have told the District Attorney that the two defendants stated on each and 
 every occasion they would not tell people not to register 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 Perhaps the Times reporter refused to go to the extent of perjuring himself   Patrolmen and 
 detectives are not so timid in such matters   Hence Mr. Randolph and Mr. Cadell to rescue the 
 situation   Imagine employing tenth rate stenographers to report the very important speeches 
 of dangerous trouble makers   What lack of forethought and efficiency on the part of the 
 District Attorney   But even these two members of the police department failed to prove by 
 their notes that we advised people not to register   But since they had to produce something 
 incriminating against Anarchists they conveniently resorted to the old standby always 
 credited to us We believe in violence and we will use violence 
 Assuming gentlemen of the jury that his sentence was really used at the meeting of May 
 18th it would still fail to prove the indictment which charges conspiracy and overt acts to 
 carry out the conspiracy   And that is all we are charged with 
 Not violence not Anarchism   I will go further and say that had the indictment been for the 
 advocacy of violence you gentlemen of the jury would still have to render a verdict of Not 
 Guilty since the mere belief in a thing or even the announcement that you would carry out 
 that belief can not possibly constitute a crime 
 However I wish to say emphatically that no such expression as We believe in violence and 
 we will use violence was uttered at the meeting of May 18th or at any other meeting   I 
 could not have employed such a phrase as there was no occasion for it   If for no other 
 reason it is because I want my lectures and speeches to be coherent and logical   The 
 sentence credited to me is neither 
 I have read to you my position toward political violence from a lengthy essay called The 
 Psychology of Political Violence 
 But to make that a position clearer and simpler I wish to say that I am a social student   It is 
 my mission in life to ascertain the cause of our social evils and of our social difficulties   As a 
 student of social wrongs it is my aim to diagnose a wrong   To simply condemn the man who 
 has committed an act of political violence in order to save my skin would be as unpardonable 
 as it would be on the part of the physician who is called to diagnose a case to condemn the 
 patient because the patient has tuberculosis caner or some other disease 
 The honest earnest sincere physician does not only prescribe medicine he tries to find out 
 the cause of the disease   And if the patient is at all capable as to means the doctor will say 
 to him Get out of this putrid air get out of the factory get out of the place where your lungs 
 are being infected   He will not merely give him medicine   He will tell him the cause of the 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 disease   And that is precisely my position in regard to acts of violence   That is what I have 
 said on every platform   I have attempted to explain the cause and the reason for acts of 
 political violence 
 It is organized violence on top which creates individual violence at the bottom   It is the 
 accumulated indignation against organized wrong organized crime organized injustice which 
 drives the political offender to his act   To condemn him means to be blind to the causes which 
 make him   I can no more do it nor have I the right to than the physician who were to 
 condemn the patient for his disease   You and I and all of us who remain indifferent to the 
 crimes of poverty of war of human degradation are equally responsible for the act 
  offender   May I therefore be permitted to say in the words of a 
 great teacher   He who is without sin among you let him cast the first stone   Does that 
 mean advocating violence   You might as well accuse Jesus of advocating prostitution 
 because He took the part of the prostitute Mary Magdalene 
 Gentlemen of the jury the meeting of the 18th of May was called primarily for the purpose of 
 voicing the position of the conscientious objector and to point out the evils of conscription  
 Now who and what is the conscientious objector   Is he really a shirker a slacker or a 
 coward   To call him that is to be guilty of dense ignorance of the forces which impel men and 
 women to stand out against the whole world like a glittering lone star upon a dark horizon  
 The conscientious objector is   Wilson in his speech of Feb. 3 1917 
 called the righteous passion for justice upon which all war all structure of family State and 
 of mankind must rest as the ultimate base of our existence or our liberty   The righteous 
 passion for justice which can never express itself in human slaughter that is the force which 
 makes the conscientious objector   Poor indeed is the country which fails to recognize the 
 importance of that new type of humanity as the ultimate base of our existence and liberty  
 It will find itself barren of that which makes for character and quality in its people 
 The meeting of May 18th was held before the Draft Bill had actually gone into effect   The 
 President signed it late in the evening of the 18th   Whatever was said at the meeting even if I 
 had counseled young men not to register that meeting can not serve as proof of an overt act  
 Why then has the Prosecuting Attorney dwelt so much at such length and with such pains 
 on that meeting and so little on the other meetings held on the eve of registration and after  
 Is it not because the District Attorney knew that we had no stenographic notes of that 
 meeting   He knew it because he was approached by Mr. Weinberger and other friends for a 
 copy of the transcript which request he refused   Evidently the District Attorney felt safe to 
 use the notes of a patrolman and a detective knowing that they would swear to anything 
 their superiors wanted   I never like to accuse anyone I would n’t go so far as my co- 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 defendant Mr. Berkman in saying that the District Attorney doctored the document I do n’t 
 know whether he did or not   But I do know that Patrolman Randolph and Detective Cadell 
 doctored the notes for the simple reason that I did n’t say those things   But though we could 
 not produce our own stenographic notes we have been able to   women of 
 unimpeachable character and high intelligence that the notes of Randolph are utterly false  
 We have also proven beyond a reasonable doubt and Mr. Content did not dare question our 
 proof that at the Hunts Point Palace held on the eve or registration I expressly stated that I 
 can not and will not tell people not to register   We have further proven that this was my 
 definite stand which was explained in my statement sent from Springfield and read at the 
 meeting of May 23rd 
 When we go through the entire testimony given on behalf of the prosecution I insist that 
 there is not one single point to sustain the indictment for conspiracy or to prove the overt acts 
 we are supposed to have committed   But we were even compelled to bring a man eighty 
 years of age to the witness stand in order to stop if possible and intention to drag in the 
 question of German money   It is true and I appreciate it that Mr. Content said he had no 
 knowledge of it   But gentlemen of the jury somebody from the District Attorney ’s office or 
 someone from the Marshal ’s office must have given out the statement that a bank receipt for 
 $ 2,400 was found in my office and must have told the newspapers the fake story of German 
 money   As if we would ever touch German money or Russian money or American money 
 coming from the ruling class to advance our ideas   But in order to forestall any suspicion 
 any insinuation in order to stand clear before you we were compelled to bring an old man 
 here to inform you that he has been a radical all his life that he is interested in our ideas and 
 that he is the man who contributed the money for radical purposes and for the work of Miss 
 Goldman 
 Gentlemen of the jury you will be I am sure that when you render a 
 verdict you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that you must not assume that we 
 are guilty before we are proven guilty and that it is your duty to assume that we are 
 innocent   And yet as a matter of fact the burden of proof has been laid upon us   We had to 
 bring witnesses   If we had had time we could have brought fifty more witnesses each 
 corroborating the others   Some of those people have no relation with us   Some are writers 
 poets contributors to the most conventional magazines   Is it likely that they would swear to 
 something in our favor if it were not the truth   Therefore I insist as did my co defendant 
 Alexander Berkman that the prosecution has made a very poor showing in proving the 
 conspiracy or any overt act 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 Gentlemen of the jury we have been in public life for twenty seven years   We have been 
 haled into court in and out of season we have never denied our position   Even the police 
 know that Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are not shirkers   You have had occasion 
 during this trial to convince yourselves that we do not deny   We have gladly and proudly 
 claimed responsibility not only for what we ourselves have said and written but even for 
 things   with which we did not agree   Is it plausible then that we would 
 go through the ordeal trouble and expense of a lengthy trial to escape responsibility in this 
 instance   A thousand times no   But we refuse to be tried on a trumped up charge or to be 
 merely because we are Anarchists and  
 whom we have openly fought for many years 
 Gentlemen during our examination of talesmen when we asked whether you would be 
 prejudiced against us if it were proven that we propagated ideas and opinions contrary to 
 those you were   to say If they are within the 
 law   But what the Court did not tell you is that no new faith not even the most humane 
 and peaceable has ever been considered within the  were in power   The 
 history of human growth is at the same time the history of every new idea heralding the 
 approach of a brighter dawn and the brighter dawn has always been considered illegal 
 outside of the law 
 Gentlemen of the jury most of you I take it are believers in the teachings of Jesus   Bear in 
 mind that he was put to   considered his views as being against the law   I 
 also take it that you are proud of you Americanism   Remember that those who fought and 
 bled for your liberties were in their time considered as being against the law as dangerous 
 disturbers and trouble makers   They not only preached violence but they carried out their 
  into the Boston harbor   They said that Resistance to tyranny is 
 obedience to God   They wrote a dangerous document called the Declaration of 
 Independence   A document which continues to be dangerous to this day and for the 
 circulation of which a young man was sentenced to ninety days prison in a New Your Court 
 only the other day   They were the Anarchists of their time they were never within the law 
 Your Government is allied with the French Republic   Need I call you attention to the historic 
 fact that the great upheaval in France was brought  means   The Dantes 
 the Robespieres the Marats the Herberts aye even the man who is responsible for the most 
 stirring revolutionary music the Marseillaise which unfortunately has deteriorated into a war 
 tune even Camille Desmoulins were never within the law   But for those great pioneers and 
 rebels France would have continued under the yoke of the idle Louis XVI to whom the sport 
 of shooting jack rabbits was more important than the destiny of the people of France 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 Ah gentlemen on the very day when we were being tried for conspiracy and overt acts your 
 city officials and representatives welcomed with music and festivities the Russian 
 Commission   Are you aware of the fact that nearly all of the members of that Commission 
 have only recently been released from exile   The ideas they propagated were never within 
 the law   For nearly a hundred years from 1825 to 1917 the Tree of Liberty in Russia was 
   No greater heroism no nobler lives had ever been 
 dedicated to humanity   Not one of them worked within the law   I could continue to 
 enumerate almost endlessly the hosts of men and women in every land and in every period 
 whose ideas and ideals redeemed the world because they were not within the law 
 Never can a new idea move within the law   It matters not whether that idea pertains to 
 political and social changes or to any other domain of human thought and expression to 
 science literature music in fact everything that makes for freedom and joy and beauty must 
 refuse to move within the law   How can it be otherwise   The law is stationary fixed 
 mechanical a chariot wheel which grinds all alike without regard to time place and 
 condition without ever taking into account cause and effect without ever going into the 
 complexity of the human soul 
 Progress knows nothing of fixity   It can not be pressed into a definite mould   It can not bow to 
 the dictum I have ruled I am the regulating finger of God   Progress is ever renewing 
 ever becoming ever changing never is it within the law 
 If that be crime we are criminals even like Jesus Socrates Galileo Bruno John Brown and 
 scores of others   We are in good company among those whom Havelock Ellis the greatest 
 living psychologist describes as the political criminals   civilized world 
 except America as men and women who out of deep love for humanity out of a passionate 
 reverence for liberty and an all absorbing devotion to an ideal are ready to pay for their faith 
 even with their blood   We can not do otherwise if we are to be true to ourselves we know 
 that the political criminal is the precursor of human progress the political criminal of today 
 must needs be the hero the martyr and the saint of the new age 
 But says the Prosecuting Attorney the press and the unthinking rabble in high and low 
 station that is a dangerous doctrine and unpatriotic at this time   No doubt it is   But are we 
 to be held responsible for something which is as unchangeable and unalienable as the very 
 stars hanging in the heavens unto time and all eternity 
 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           
 Gentlemen to the jury we respect your patriotism   We would not if we could have you 
 change its meaning for yourself   But may there not be different kinds of patriotism as there 
 are different kinds of liberty   I for one can not believe that love of one ’s country must needs 
 consist in blindness to its social faults to deafness to its social discords of inarticulation to its 
 social wrongs   Neither can I believe that the mere accident of birth in a certain country or the 
 mere scrap of a citizen ’s paper constitutes the love of country 
 I know many people I am one of them who were not born here nor have the applied for 
 citizenship and who yet love America with deeper passion and greater intensity that many 
 natives whose patriotism manifests  and insulting those who do not 
 rise when the national anthem is played   Our patriotism is that of the man who loves a 
 woman with open eyes   He is yet he sees her faults   So we too 
 who know America love her beauty her richness her great possibilities we love her 
 mountains her canyons her forests her Niagara and her deserts above all do we love the 
 people that have produced her wealth her artists who have created beauty her great 
 apostles who dream and work for liberty but with the same passionate emotion we hate her 
 superficiality her ca nt her corruption her mad unscrupulous worship at the alter of the 
 Golden Calf 
 We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy she must 
 first make democracy safe in America   How else is the world to take America seriously when 
 democracy at home is daily being outrages free speech suppressed peaceable assemblies 
 broken   brutal gangsters in uniform when free press is curtailed and 
 every independent opinion gagged   Verily poor as we are in democracy how can we give of 
 it to the world   We further say that a democracy conceived in the military servitude of the 
 masses in their economic enslavement and nurtured in their tears and blood is not 
 democracy at all   It is despotism the cumulative result of a chain of abuses which 
 according to the dangerous document the Declaration of Independence the people have the 
 right to overthrow 
 The District Attorney has dragged in our Manifesto and he has emphasized the passage 
 Resist conscription   Gentlemen of the jury please remember that that is not the charge 
 against us   But admitting that the Manifesto contains the expression Resist conscription 
 may I ask you is there only one kind of resistance   Is there only the resistance which means 
 the gun the bayonet the bomb or flying machine   Is there not another kind of resistance  
 May not the people simply fold their hands and declare We will not fight when we do not 
 believe in the necessity of war   May not the people who believe in the repeal of the 
 Conscription Law because it is unconstitutional express their opposition in word and by pen 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           0 
 in meetings and in other ways   What right has the District Attorney to interpret that 
 particular passage to suit himself   Moreover gentlemen of the jury I insist that the 
 indictment against us does not refer to conscription   We are charged with a conspiracy 
 against registration   And in no way or manner has the prosecution proven that we are guilty 
 of conspiracy or that we have committed an overt act 
 Gentlemen of the jury you are not called upon to accept our views to approve of them or to 
 justify them   You are not even called upon to decide whether our views are within or against 
 the law   You are called upon to decide whether the prosecution has proven that the 
 defendants Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman have conspired to urge people not to 
 register   And whether their speeches and writings represent overt acts 
 Whatever you verdict gentlemen it can not possibly affect the rising tide of discontent in this 
 country against war which despite all boasts is a war for conquest and military power  
 Neither can it affect the ever increasing opposition to conscription which is a military and 
 industrial yoke placed upon the necks of the American people   Least of all will your verdict 
 affect those to whom human life is sacred and who will not become a party to the world 
 slaughter   Your verdict can only add to the opinion of the world as to whether or not justice 
 and liberty are a living force in this country or a mere shadow of the past 
 Your verdict may of course affect us temporarily in a physical sense it can have no effect 
 whatever upon our spirit   For even if we were convicted and found guilty and the penalty 
 were that we be placed against a wall and shot dead I should nevertheless cry out with the 
 great Luther   Here I am and her I stand and I can not do otherwise 
 And gentlemen in conclusion let me tell you that my co defendant Mr. Berkman was right 
 when he said the eyes of America are upon you   They are upon you not because of sympathy 
 for us or agreement with Anarchism   They are upon you because it must decided sooner or 
 later whether we are justified in telling people that we will give the democracy in Europe 
 when we have no democracy here   Shall free speech and free assemblage shall criticism and 
 opinion which even the espionage bill did not include be destroyed   Shall it be a shadow 
 of the past the great historic American past   Shall it be trampled 
 or policeman anyone who decides upon it   Or shall free speech and free press and free 
 assemblage continue to be the heritage of the American people 
 
  
  
 
                
     
     
                           1 
 Gentlemen of the jury whatever you verdict will be as far as we are concerned nothing will 
 be changed   I have held ideas all my life   I have publicly held my ideas for twenty seven 
 years   Nothing on earth would ever make me change my ideas except one thing and that is 
 if you will prove to me that our position is wrong untenable or lacking in historic fact   But 
 never would I change my ideas because I am found guilty   I may remind you of two great 
 Americans undoubtedly not unknown to you gentlemen of the jury   Ralph Waldo Emerson 
 and Henry David Thoreau   When Thoreau was placed in prison for refusing to pay taxes he 
 was   Emerson and Emerson said   David what are you doing in jail  
 and Thoreau replied   Ralph what are you doing outside when honest people are in jail for 
 their ideals   Gentlemen of   the jury I do not wish to influence you   I do not wish to appeal 
 to you passions   I do not wish to influence   that I am a woman   I have no 
 such desires and no such designs   I take it that you are sincere enough and honest enough 
 and brave enough to render a verdict according to you convictions beyond the shadow of a 
 reasonable doubt 
 Please forget that we are Anarchists   Forget that it is claimed that we propagated violence  
 Forget that something appeared in MOTHER EARTH when I was thousands of miles away 
 three years ago   Forget all that and merely consider the evidence   Have we been engaged in 
 a conspiracy   has that conspiracy been proven   have we committed overt acts   have those 
 overt acts been proven   We for the defense say they have not been proven   And therefore 
 your verdict must be not guilty 
 But whatever your decision the struggle must go on   We are but the atoms in the incessant 
 human struggle towards the light that shines in the darkness the Ideal of economic political 
 and spiritual liberation of mankind",0.0600686632096767,0.0449287481606006,0.1634328365325927,0.2488301396369934,0.0622710026800632,0.3799924850463867,0.0404761619865894,0.05115786810592,0.4871122402128895,55.97538699891186,0.2302858938108702,0.008953280156275436,0.08158415841584159,0.03160188884852888,27.18141592920354,1.0
26,Anita Hill,Opening Statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee,1991," 
 
 
 Ms. Hill Mr. Chairman Senator Thurmond members of the committee 
 My name is Anita F. Hill and I am a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma I was 
 born on a farm in Okmulgee County Oklahoma in 1956 I am the youngest of 13 children I 
 had my early education in Okmulgee County My father Albert Hill is a farmer in that area 
 My mother 's name is Irma Hill She is also a farmer and a housewife 
 My childhood was one of a lot of hard work and not much money but it was one of solid 
 family affection as   I was reared in a religious atmosphere in the 
 Baptist faith and I have been a member of the Antioch Baptist Church in Tulsa Oklahoma 
 since 1983 It is a very warm part of my life at the present time 
 For my undergraduate work I went to Oklahoma State University and graduated from there in 
 1977 I am attaching to this statement a copy of my resume for further details of my 
 education  
  
  
 
                              
     
     
             
 Senator Biden It will be included in the record as if read  
 Ms. Hill Thank you I graduated from the university with academic honors and proceeded to 
 the Yale Law School where I received my JD degree in 1980 Upon graduation from law 
 school I became a practicing lawyer with the Washington DC firm of Ward Hardraker and 
 Ross 
 In 1981 I was introduced to now Judge   friend Judge Thomas told me 
 that he was anticipating a political appointment and he asked if I would be interested in 
 working with him He was in fact appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil 
 Rights After he was After he had taken that post he asked if I would become his assistant 
 and I accepted that position  
 In my early period there I had two major projects The first was an article I wrote for Judge 
 Thomas 's signature on the education of minority students The second was the organization of 
 a seminar on high risk students which was abandoned because Judge Thomas transferred to 
 the EEOC where he became the chairman of that office  
 During this period at the Department of Education my working relationship with Judge 
 Thomas was positive I had a good deal of responsibility and independence I thought he 
 respected my work and that he trusted my judgment After approximately three months of 
 working there he asked me to go out socially with him 
 What happened next and telling the world about it are the two most difficult things 
 experiences of my life It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless 
 number a great number of sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleasant 
 matters to anyone but my close friends  
 I declined the invitation to go out socially with him and explained to him that I thought it 
 would jeopardize at what at at the time I considered to be a very good working 
 relationship I had a normal social life with other men outside of the office I believed then as 
 now that having a social relationship with a person who was supervising my work would be 
 ill advised I was very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so  
 I thought   and explaining my reasons my employer would abandon his social 
 suggestions However to my regret in the following few weeks he continued to ask me out 
 on several occasions He pressed me to justify my reasons for saying no to him These 
  
  
 
                              
     
     
             
 incidents took place in his office or mine They were in the form of private conversations which 
 not would not have been   
 My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work 
 situations to discuss sex On these occasions he would call me into his office for reports on 
 education issues and projects or he might suggest that because of the time pressures of his 
 schedule we go to lunch to a government cafeteria After a brief discussion of work he would 
 turn the conversation to a discussion of sexual matters 
 His conversations were very vivid He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films 
 involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or 
 rape scenes He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises 
 or large breasts involved in various sex acts On several occasions Thomas told me 
 graphically of his own sexual prowess 
 Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all and particularly in 
 such a graphic way I told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects I would also 
 try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his 
 background or his beliefs My efforts to change the the subject were rarely successful 
 Throughout the period of these conversations he also from time to time asked me for social 
 engagements My reaction to these conversations was to avoid them by eliminating 
 opportunities for us to engage in extended conversations This was difficult because at the 
 time I was his only assistant at the Office of Education or Office for Civil Rights 
 During the latter part of my time at the Department of Education the social pressures and 
 any conversation of his offensive behavior ended I began both to believe and hope that our 
 working relationship could be a proper cordial and professional one 
 When Judge Thomas was made chair of the EEOC I needed to face the question of whether to 
 go with him I was asked to do so and I did The work itself was interesting and at that time 
 it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so troubled me had ended I also faced the 
 realistic fact that I had no alternative job While I might have gone back to private practice 
 perhaps in my old firm or at another I was dedicated to civil rights work and my first choice 
 was to be in that field Moreover the Department of Education itself was a dubious venture 
 President Reagan was seeking to abolish the entire department 
  
  
 
                              
     
     
             
 For my first months at the EEOC where I continued to be an assistant to Judge Thomas there 
 were no sexual conversations or overtures However during the fall and winter of 1982 these 
 began again The comments were random and ranged from pressing me about why I did n't go 
 out with him to remarks about my personal appearance I remember his saying that some day 
 I would have to tell him the real reason that I would n't go out with him 
 He began to show displeasure in his tone and voice and his demeanor and his continued 
 pressure for an explanation He commented on what I was wearing in terms of whether it 
 made me more or less sexually attractive The incidents occurred in his inner office at the 
 EEOC 
 One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a 
 Coke in his office He got up from the table at which we were working went over to his desk 
 to get the Coke looked at the can and asked Who has pubic hair on my Coke On other 
 occasions he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal and he also 
 spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex 
 At this point late 1982 I began to feel severe stress on the job I began to be concerned that 
 Clarence Thomas might take out his anger with   or not giving me 
 important assignments I also thought that he might find an excuse for dismissing me 
 In January of 1983 I began looking for another job I was handicapped because I feared that 
 if he found out he might make it difficult for me to find other employment and I might be 
 dismissed from the job I had Another factor that made my search more difficult was that 
 there was a period this was during a period of a hiring freeze in the government In 
 February 1983 I was hospitalized for five days on an emergency basis for an acute for 
 acute stomach pain which I attributed to stress on the job 
 Once out of the hospital I became more committed to find other employment and sought 
 further to minimize my contact with Thomas This became easier when Allison Duncan  
 became office director because most of my work was then funneled through her and I had 
 contact with Clarence Thomas mostly in staff meetings  
 In the spring of 1983 an opportunity to teach at Oral Roberts University opened up I 
 participated in a seminar taught an afternoon session and seminar at Oral Roberts 
 University The dean of the of the university saw me teaching and inquired as to whether I 
 would be interested in furthering pursuing a career in teaching beginning at Oral Roberts 
  
  
 
                              
     
     
             
 University I agreed to take the job in large part because of my desire to escape the pressures 
 I felt at the EEOC due to Judge Thomas 
 When I informed him that I was leaving in July I recall that his response was that now I 
 would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him I told him that I still preferred not 
 to do so At some time after that meeting he asked if he could take me to dinner at the end 
 of the term When I declined he assured me that the dinner was a professional courtesy only 
 and not a social invitation I reluctantly agreed to accept that invitation but only if it was at 
 the very end of a working day 
 On as I recall the last day of my employment at the EEOC in the summer of 1983 I did have 
 dinner with Clarence Thomas We went directly from work to a restaurant near the office We 
 talked about the work I had done both at Education and at the EEOC He told me that he was 
 pleased with all of it except for an article and speech that I had done for him while we were at 
 the Office for Civil Rights Finally he made a comment that I will vividly remember He said 
 that if I ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career This was not an 
 apology nor was it an explanation That was his last remark about the possibility of our going 
 out or reference to his behavior  
 In July of 1983 I left Washington D.C. area and I 've had minimal contacts with Judge 
 Clarence Thomas since I am of course aware from the Press that some questions have been 
 raised about conversations I had with Judge Clarence Thomas after I left the EEOC From 
 1983 until today I have seen Judge Thomas only twice On one occasion I needed to get a 
 reference from him and on another he made a public appearance in Tulsa  
 On one occasion he called me at home and we had an inconsequential conversation On one 
 occasion he called me without reaching me and I returned the call without reaching him and 
 nothing came of it I have on at least three occasions been asked to act as a conduit to 
 him for others  
 I knew his secretary Diane Holt We had worked together at both EEOC and Education There 
 were occasions on which I spoke to her and on some of these occasions undoubtedly I passed 
 on some casual comment to then Chairman Thomas There were a series of calls in the first 
 three months of 1985   in Tulsa which wished to have a civil rights 
 conference They wanted Judge Thomas to be the speaker and enlisted my assistance for this 
 purpose  
  
  
 
                              
     
     
             
 I did call in January and February to no effect and finally suggested to the person directly 
 involved Susan Cahall that she put the that she put the matter into her own hands and 
 call directly She did so in March of 1985 In connection with that March invitation Ms. Cahall 
 wanted conference materials for the seminar and some research was needed I was asked to 
 try to get the information and did attempt to do so  
 There was another call about another possible conference in the July of 1985 In August of 
 1987 I was in Washington D.C. and I did call Diane Holt In the course of this conversation 
 she asked me how long I was going to be in town and I told her It is recorded in the message 
 as August 15 It was in fact August 20th She told me about Judge Thomas 's marriage and I 
 did say Congratulate him  
 It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that I am able to talk of these 
 unpleasant matters to anyone except my closest friends As I 've said before these last few 
 days have been very trying and very hard for me and it has n't just been the last few days 
 this week It has actually been over a month now that I have been under the strain of this 
 issue  
 Telling the world is the most difficult experience of my life but it is very close to having to live 
 through the experience that occasion this meeting I may have used poor judgment early on 
 in my relationship with this issue I was aware however that telling at any point in my career 
 could adversely affect my future career And I did not want early on to burn all the bridges to 
 the EEOC  
 As I said I may have used poor judgment Perhaps I should have taken angry or even 
 militant steps both when I was in the agency or after I left it But I must confess to the world 
 that the course that I took seemed the better as well as the easier approach  
 I declined any comment to newspapers but later when Senate staff asked me about these 
 matters I felt I had a duty to report I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas I 
 seek only to provide the committee with information which it may regard as relevant  
 It would have been more comfortable to remain silent It took no initiative to inform anyone 
 I took no initiative to inform anyone But when I was   of this 
 committee to report my experience I felt that I had to tell the truth I could not keep silent",0.0350065492093563,0.0363349393010139,0.2037153840065002,0.2857743799686432,0.3707880973815918,0.0497853681445121,0.0185953695327043,0.0529047073374804,0.4748277492815306,51.504752284215954,0.2635714285714285,0.02116585704371964,0.09558160504959423,0.05325670498084291,21.507462686567163,1.0
27,General Douglas MacArthur,Farewell Address to Congress,1951," 
 
 
 Mr. President Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Members of the Congress 
 I stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride humility in the wake 
 of those great American architects of our history who have stood here before me pride in the 
 reflection that this forum of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet 
 devised Here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race I do 
 not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause for the issues are fundamental and reach 
 quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration They must be resolved on the highest plane 
 of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected I trust therefore 
 that you will do me the justice of receiving that which I have to say as solely expressing the 
 considered viewpoint of a fellow American 
 I address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life with but one 
 purpose in mind to serve my country The issues are global and so interlocked that to 
 consider the problems of one sector oblivious to those of another is but to court disaster for 
 the whole 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 While Asia is commonly referred to as the Gateway to Europe it is no less true that Europe is 
 the Gateway to Asia and the broad influence of the one can not fail to have its impact upon 
 the other There are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts that 
 we can not divide our effort I can think of no greater expression of defeatism If a potential 
 enemy can divide his strength on two fronts it is for us to counter his effort The Communist 
 threat is a global one Its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every 
 other sector You can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in Asia without 
 simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in Europe 
 Beyond pointing out these general truisms I shall confine my discussion to the general areas 
 of Asia Before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there he must 
 comprehend something of Asia 's past and the revolutionary changes which are which have 
 marked her course up to the present Long -called colonial powers with 
 little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice individual dignity or a higher 
 standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the Philippines the peoples of 
 Asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and 
 now see the dawn of new opportunity a heretofore unfelt dignity and the self respect of 
 political freedom 
 Mustering half of the earth 's population and 60 percent of its natural resources these peoples 
 are rapidly consolidating a new force both moral and material with which to raise the living 
 standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural 
 environments Whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not this is the direction 
 of Asian progress and it may not be stopped It is a corollary to the shift of the world 
 economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area 
 whence it started 
 In this situation it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with 
 this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the 
 colonial era is now past and the Asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny 
 What they seek now is friendly guidance understanding and support not imperious 
 direction the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation Their pre war standard 
 of life pitifully low is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in war 's wake World 
 ideologies play little part in Asian thinking and are little understood What the peoples strive 
 for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs a little better clothing on their 
 backs a little firmer roof over their heads and the realization of the normal nationalist urge 
 for political freedom These political social conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 own national security but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be 
 thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism 
 Of more direct and immediate bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in 
 the strategic potential of the Pacific Ocean in the course of the past war Prior thereto the 
 western strategic frontier of the United States lay on the littoral line of the Americas with an 
 exposed island salient extending out through Hawaii Midway and Guam to the Philippines 
 That salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the 
 enemy could and did attack 
 The Pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the 
 bordering land areas All this was   victory Our strategic frontier then 
 shifted to embrace the entire Pacific Ocean which became a vast moat to protect us as long 
 as we held it Indeed it acts as a protective shield for all of the Americas and all free lands of 
 the Pacific Ocean area We control it to the shores of   of islands extending in an 
 arc from the Aleutians to the Mariannas   From this island chain 
 we can dominate with sea and air power every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore 
 with sea and air power every port as I said from Vladivostok to Singapore and prevent any 
 hostile movement into the Pacific 
 Any predatory attack from Asia must be an amphibious effort No amphibious force can be 
 successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of 
 advance With naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases any 
 major attack from continental Asia toward us or our friends in the Pacific would be doomed to 
 failure 
 Under such conditions the Pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a 
 prospective invader It assumes instead the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake Our line of 
 defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and 
 expense It envisions no attack against anyone nor does it provide the bastions essential for 
 offensive operations but properly maintained would be an invincible defense against 
 aggression The holding of this littoral defense line in the western Pacific is entirely dependent 
 upon holding all segments thereof for any major breach of that   power 
 would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment 
 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 This is a military estimate as to which I have yet to find a military leader who will take 
 exception For that reason I have strongly recommended in the past as a matter of military 
 urgency that under no circumstances must Formosa fall under Communist control Such an 
 eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the Philippines and the loss of Japan and 
 might well force our western frontier back to the coast of California Oregon and Washington 
 To understand the changes which now appear upon the Chinese mainland one must 
 understand the changes in Chinese character and culture over the past 50 years China up to 
 50 years ago was completely non homogenous being compartmented into groups divided 
 against each other The war making tendency was almost non existent as they still followed 
 the tenets of the Confucian ideal of pacifist culture At the turn of the century under the 
 regime of Chang Tso Lin efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a 
 nationalist urge This was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of 
 Chiang Kai Shek but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the 
 point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant 
 aggressive tendencies 
 Through these past 50 years the Chinese people have thus become militarized in their 
 concepts and in their ideals They now constitute excellent soldiers with competent staffs and 
 commanders This has produced a new and dominant power in Asia which for its own 
 purposes is allied with Soviet Russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become 
 aggressively imperialistic with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of 
 imperialism 
 There is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the Chinese make up 
 The standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly 
  the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which 
 seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies 
 I have from the beginning believed that the Chinese Communists support of the North 
 Koreans was the dominant one Their interests are at present parallel with those of the 
 Soviet But I believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in Korea but also in 
 Indo China and Tibet and pointing potentially toward the South reflects predominantly the 
 same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every would be conqueror since the 
 beginning of time 
 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 The Japanese people since the war have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in 
 modern history With a commendable will eagerness to learn and marked capacity to 
 understand they have from the ashes left in war 's wake erected in Japan an edifice 
 dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity and in the ensuing 
 process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance 
 of political morality freedom of economic enterprise and social justice  
 Politically economically and socially Japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth 
 and will not again fail the universal trust That it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly 
 beneficial influence over the course of events in Asia is   manner in 
 which the Japanese people have met the recent challenge of war unrest and confusion 
 surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers 
 without the slightest slackening in their forward progress I sent all four of our occupation 
 divisions to the Korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting 
 power vacuum upon Japan The results fully justified my faith I know of no nation more 
 serene orderly and industrious nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future 
 constructive service in the advance of the human race 
 Of our former ward the Philippines we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest 
 will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of war 's 
 terrible destructiveness We must be patient and understanding and never fail them as in 
 our hour of need they did not fail us A Christian nation the Philippines stand as a mighty 
 bulwark of Christianity in the Far East and its capacity for high moral leadership in Asia is 
 unlimited  
 On Formosa the government of the Republic of China has had the opportunity to refute by 
 action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the 
 Chinese mainland The Formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration 
 with majority representation on the organs of government and politically economically and 
 socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines 
 With this brief insight into the surrounding areas I now turn to the Korean conflict While I 
 was not consulted prior to the President 's decision to intervene in support of the Republic of 
 Korea that decision from a military standpoint proved a sound one as we as I said 
 proved a sound one as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces Our victory was 
 complete and our objectives within reach when Red China intervened with numerically 
 superior ground forces 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 This created a new war and an entirely new situation a situation not contemplated when our 
 forces were committed against the North Korean invaders a situation which called for new 
 decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy 
 Such decisions have not been forthcoming 
 While no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental 
 China and such was never given a thought the new situation did urgently demand a drastic 
 revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had 
 defeated the old 
 Apart from the military need as I saw It to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the 
 enemy north of the Yalu I felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made 
 necessary first the intensification of our economic blockade against China two the imposition 
 of a naval blockade against the China coast three removal of restrictions on air 
 reconnaissance of China 's coastal areas and of Manchuria four removal of restrictions on the 
 forces of the Republic of China on Formosa with logistical support to contribute to their 
 effective operations against the common enemy 
 For entertaining these views all professionally designed to support our forces committed to 
 Korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless 
 American and allied lives I have been severely criticized in lay circles principally abroad 
 despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully 
 shared in the   military leader concerned with the Korean campaign 
 including our own Joint Chiefs of Staff  
 I called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available I made 
 clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy built up bases north of the Yalu if not 
 permitted to utilize the friendly Chinese Force of some 600,000 men on Formosa if not 
 permitted to blockade the China coast to prevent the Chinese Reds from getting succor from 
 without and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements the position of the 
 command from the military standpoint forbade victory 
 We could hold in   and in an approximate area where our supply 
 line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy but we 
 could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon 
 our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential I have constantly called for the new 
 political decisions essential to a solution 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 Efforts have been made to distort my position It has been said in effect that I was a 
 warmonger Nothing could be further from the truth I know war as few other men now living 
 know it and nothing to me is more revolting I have long advocated its complete abolition as 
 its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling 
 international disputes Indeed on the second day of September nineteen hundred and forty- 
 five just following the surrender of the Japanese nation on the Battleship Missouri I formally 
 cautioned as follows 
 Men since the beginning of time have sought peace Various methods through the ages 
 have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes 
 between nations From the very start workable methods were found in so far as 
 individual citizens were concerned but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger 
 international scope have never been successful Military alliances balances of power 
 Leagues of Nations all in turn failed leaving the only path to   the crucible 
 of war The utter   destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative We have had 
 our last chance If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system 
 Armageddon will be at our door The problem basically is theological and involves a 
 spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with 
 our almost matchless advances in science art literature and all material and cultural 
 developments of the past 2000 years It must be of the spirit if we are to save the 
 flesh 
 But once war is forced upon us there is no other alternative than to apply every available 
 means to bring it to a swift end 
 War 's very object is victory not prolonged indecision 
 In war there is no substitute for victory 
 There are some who for varying reasons would appease Red China They are blind to 
 history 's clear lesson for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but 
 begets new and bloodier war It points to no single instance where this end has justified that 
 means where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace Like blackmail it lays the 
 basis for new and successively greater demands until as in blackmail violence becomes the 
 only other alternative 
 Why my soldiers asked of me surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field I 
 could not answer 
  
  
 
               
     
     
      
        
 Some may say to avoid spread of the conflict into an all out war with China others to avoid 
 Soviet intervention Neither explanation seems valid for China is already engaging with the 
 maximum power it can commit and the Soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our 
 moves Like a cobra any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the 
 relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a world wide basis 
 The tragedy of Korea is further   that its military action is confined to its 
 territorial limits It condemns that nation which it is our purpose to save to suffer the 
 devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the enemy 's sanctuaries are fully 
 protected from such attack and devastation 
 Of the nations of the world Korea alone up to now is the sole one which has risked its all 
 against communism The magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the Korean people 
 defies description  
 They have chosen to risk death rather than slavery Their last words to me were Do n't 
 scuttle the Pacific 
 I have just left your fighting sons in Korea They have met all tests there and I can report to 
 you without reservation that they are splendid in every way 
 It was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with 
 the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life Its growing bloodshed has caused me 
 the deepest anguish and anxiety  
 Those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always 
 I am closing my 52 years of military service When I joined the Army even before the turn of 
 the century it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams The world has turned 
 over many times since I took the oath on the plain at West Point and the hopes and dreams 
 have long since vanished but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack 
 ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die they just fade 
 away 
 And like the old soldier of that ballad I now close my military career and just fade away an 
 old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty

28,Ronald Reagan,The Space Shuttle Challenger Tragedy Address,1986," 
 
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen I 'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union 
 but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans Today is a day for 
 mourning and remembering Nancy and I are pained to the   of the Shuttle 
 Challenger We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country This is truly a 
 national loss 
 Nineteen years ago almost to the day we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the 
 ground But we 've never lost an astronaut in flight We 've never had a tragedy like this 
 And perhaps we 've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle But they the 
 Challenger Seven were aware of the dangers but overcame them and did their jobs 
 brilliantly We mourn seven heroes Michael Smith Dick Scobee Judith Resnik Ronald 
 McNair Ellison Onizuka Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe 
 We mourn their loss as a nation together 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
           
        
                                 
 
 For the families of the seven we can not bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy But 
 we feel the loss and we 're thinking about you so very much Your loved ones were daring and 
 brave and they had that special grace that special spirit that says Give me a challenge and 
 I 'll meet it with joy They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths They 
 wished to serve and they did They served all of us 
 We 've grown used to wonders in this century It 's hard to dazzle us But for twenty five years 
 the United States space program has been doing just that We 've grown used to the idea of 
 space and perhaps we forget that we 've only just begun We 're still pioneers They the 
 members of the Challenger crew were pioneers 
 And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live 
 coverage of the shuttle 's take off I know it 's hard to understand but sometimes painful 
 things like this happen It 's all part of the process of exploration and discovery It 's all part of 
 taking a chance and expanding man 's horizons The future does n't belong to the fainthearted 
 it belongs to the brave The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we 'll continue 
 to follow them 
 I 've always had great faith in and respect for our space program And what happened today 
 does nothing to diminish it We do n't hide our space program We do n't keep secrets and 
 cover things up We do it all up front and in public That 's the way freedom is and we 
 would n't change it for a minute  
  
  
 
                   
       
       
           
        
                                 
 We 'll continue our quest in space There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews 
 and yes more volunteers more civilians more teachers in space Nothing ends here our 
 hopes and our journeys continue 
 I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who 
 worked on this mission and tell them Your dedication and professionalism have moved and 
 impressed us for decades And we know of your anguish We share it 
 There 's a coincidence today On this day three hundred and ninety years ago the great 
 explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama In his lifetime the great 
 frontiers were the oceans and a historian later said He died on it and was 
 buried in it Well today we can say of the Challenger crew Their dedication was like 
 Drake 's complete 
 The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored   in which they lived their 
 lives We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they 
 prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to 
 touch the face of God ""1

 Good evening my fellow citizens 
 This afternoon following a series of threats and defiant statements the presence of Alabama 
 National Guardsmen was required on the University of Alabama to carry out the final and 
 unequivocal order of the United States District Court of the Northern District of Alabama That 
 order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young Alabama residents who happened 
 to have been born Negro That they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good 
 measure to the conduct of the students of the University of Alabama who met their 
 responsibilities in a constructive way 
  
  
 
               
     
     
                                   
 I hope that every American regardless of where he lives will stop and examine his 
 conscience about this and other related incidents This Nation was   many 
 nations and backgrounds It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal and 
 that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened 
 Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who 
 wish to be free And when Americans are sent to Vietnam or West Berlin we do not ask for 
 whites only It ought to be possible therefore for American students of any color to attend 
 any public institution they select without having to be backed  ought to to be 
 possible for American consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public 
 accommodation such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores without being 
 forced to resort to demonstrations in the street and it ought to be possible for American 
 citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of 
 reprisal It ought to to be possible in short for every American to enjoy the privileges of 
 being American without regard to his race or his color In short every American ought to have 
 the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated as one would wish his children to be 
 treated But this is not the case 
 The Negro baby born in America today regardless of the section of the State in which he is 
 born has about one half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in 
 the same place on the same day one third as much chance of completing college one third 
 as much chance of becoming a professional man twice as much chance of becoming 
 unemployed about one seventh as much chance of earning $ 10,000 a year a life expectancy 
 which is 7 years shorter and the prospects of earning only half as much 
 This is not a sectional issue Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city 
 in every State of the Union producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens 
 the public safety Nor is this a partisan issue In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and 
 generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics This is not even a legal or 
 legislative issue alone It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets 
 and new laws are needed at every level but law alone can not make men see right We are 
 confronted primarily with a moral issue It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the 
 American Constitution 
 The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal 
 opportunities whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated If 
 an American because his skin is dark can not eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if 
 he can not send his children to the best public school available if he can not vote for the public 
  
  
 
               
     
     
                                   
 officials who will represent him if in short he can not enjoy the full and free life which all of 
 us want then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and 
 stand in his place Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and 
 delay 
 One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves yet their 
 heirs their grandsons are not fully free They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice 
 They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression And this Nation for all its hopes 
 and all its boasts will not be fully free until all its citizens are free 
 We preach freedom around the world and we mean it and we cherish our freedom here at 
 home but are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is 
 the land of the free except for the Negroes that we have no second class citizens except 
 Negroes that we have no class or caste system no ghettoes no master race except with 
 respect to Negroes 
 Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise The events in Birmingham and 
 elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can 
 prudently choose to ignore them The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city 
 North and South where legal remedies are not at hand Redress is sought in the streets in 
 demonstrations parades and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and 
 threaten lives 
 We face therefore a moral crisis as a country and a people It can not be met by repressive 
 police action It can not be left to increased demonstrations in the streets It can not be quieted 
 by token moves or talk It is a time to act in the Congress in your State and local legislative 
 body and above all in all of our daily lives It is not enough to pin the blame on others to 
 say this a problem of one section of the country or another or deplore the facts that we face 
 A great change is at hand and our task our obligation is to make that revolution that 
 change peaceful and constructive for all Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as 
 violence Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality 
 Next week I shall ask the Congress of the United States to act to make a commitment it has 
 not fully made in this century to the proposition that race has no place in American life or law 
 The Federal judiciary has upheld that proposition in a series of forthright cases The Executive 
 Branch has adopted that proposition in the conduct of its affairs including the employment of 
 Federal personnel the use of Federal facilities and the sale of federally financed housing 
  
  
 
               
     
     
                                   
 But there are other necessary measures which only the Congress can provide and they must 
 be provided at this session The old code of equity law under which we live commands for 
 every wrong a remedy but in too many communities in too many parts of the country 
 wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens and there are no remedies at law Unless the Congress 
 acts their only remedy is the street 
 I am therefore asking the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to be 
 served in facilities which are open to the public hotels restaurants theaters retail stores 
 and similar establishments This seems to me to be an elementary right Its denial is an 
 arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure but many do 
 I have recently met with scores of business leaders urging them to take voluntary action to 
 end this discrimination and I have been and in the last two 
 weeks over 75 cities have seen progress made in desegregating these kinds of facilities But 
 many are unwilling to act alone and for this reason nationwide legislation is needed if we are 
 to move this problem from the streets to the courts 
 I 'm also asking the Congress to authorize the Federal Government to participate more fully in 
 lawsuits designed to end segregation in public education We have succeeded in persuading 
 many districts to desegregate voluntarily Dozens have admitted Negroes without violence 
 Today a Negro is attending a State supported institution in every one of our 50 States but 
 the pace is very slow 
 Too many Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time of the Supreme 
 Court 's decision nine years ago will enter segregated high schools this fall having suffered a 
 loss which can never be restored The lack of an adequate education denies the Negro a 
 chance to get a decent job 
 The orderly implementation of the Supreme Court decision therefore can not be left solely to 
 those who may not have the economic resources to carry the legal action or who may be 
 subject to harassment 
 Other features will be also requested including greater protection for the right to vote But 
 legislation I repeat can not solve this problem alone It must be solved in the homes of every 
 American in every community across our country In this respect I wanna pay tribute to those 
 citizens North and South who 've been working in their communities to make life better for all  
  
  
 
               
     
     
                                   
 They are acting not out of sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency Like our 
 soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world they are meeting freedom 's challenge on the firing 
 line and I salute them for their honor and their courage 
 My fellow Americans this is a problem which faces us all in every city of the North as well 
 as the South Today there are Negroes unemployed two or three times as many compared to 
 whites inadequate education moving into the large cities unable to find work young people 
 particularly out of work without hope denied equal rights denied the opportunity to eat at a 
 restaurant or a lunch counter or go to a movie theater denied the right to a decent education 
 denied almost today the right to attend a State university even though qualified It seems to 
 me that these are matters which concern us all not merely Presidents or Congressmen or 
 Governors but every citizen of the United States 
 This is one country It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came 
 here had an equal chance to develop their talents We can not say to ten percent of the 
 population that you ca n't have that right that your children can not have the chance to 
 develop whatever talents they have that the only way that they are going to get their rights 
 is to go in the street and demonstrate I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better 
 country than that 
 Therefore I 'm asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide 
 the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves to give a chance for every 
 child to be educated to the limit of his talents 
 As I 've said before not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation 
 but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their 
 motivation to make something of themselves 
 We have a right to expect that the Negro community will be responsible will uphold the law 
 but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair that the Constitution will be color 
 blind as Justice Harlan said at the turn of the century 
 This is what we 're talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it 
 stands for and in meeting it I ask the support of all our citizens

30,Lyndon Baines Johnson,The Great Society,1964," 
 
 
 President Hatcher Governor Romney Senators McNamara and Hart Congressmen Meader 
 and Staebler and other members of the fine Michigan delegation members of the graduating 
 class my fellow Americans 
 It is a great pleasure to be here today This university has been coeducational since 1870 but 
 I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl 
 said and I quote In choosing a college you first have to decide whether you want a 
 coeducational school or an educational school Well we can find both here at Michigan 
 although perhaps at different hours I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan 
 student whose father told a friend of mine that his son 's education had been a real value It 
 stopped his mother from bragging about him 
 I have come today from the turmoil of your capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak 
 about the future of your country The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and 
 preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people Our success in 
 that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation 
  
  
 
                               
        
 For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent For half a century we called 
 upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our 
 people The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that 
 wealth to enrich and elevate our national life and to advance the quality of our American 
 civilization 
 Your imagination and your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a 
 society where progress is the servant of our needs or a society where old values and new 
 visions are buried under unbridled growth For in your time we have the opportunity to move 
 not only toward the rich society and the powerful society but upward to the Great Society 
 The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all It demands an end to poverty and 
 racial injustice to which we are totally committed in our time But that is just the beginning 
 The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to 
 enlarge his talents It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect not a 
 feared cause of boredom and restlessness It is a place where the city of man serves not only 
 the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the 
 hunger for community It is a place where man can renew contact with nature It is a place 
 which honors creation for its own sake and for what is adds to the understanding of the race 
 It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of 
 their goods 
 But most of all the Great Society is not a safe harbor a resting place a final objective a 
 finished work It is a challenge constantly renewed beckoning us toward a destiny where the 
 meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor 
 So I want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the Great Society 
 in our cities in our countryside and in our classrooms 
 Many of you will live to see the day perhaps 50 years from now when there will be 400 
 million Americans four fifths of them in urban areas In the remainder of this century urban 
 population will double city land will double and we will have to build homes and highways 
 and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled So in the next 40 
 years we must re build the entire urban United States 
 
  
  
 
                               
        
 Aristotle said Men come together in cities in order to live but they remain together in order 
 to live the good life It is harder and harder to live the good life in American cities today The 
 catalog of ills is long there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs 
 There is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic Open land is 
 vanishing and old landmarks are violated Worst of all expansion is eroding these precious and 
 time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature The loss of 
 these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference 
 And our society will never be great until our cities are great Today the frontier of imagination 
 and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders New experiments are 
 already going on It will be the task of your generation to make the American city a place 
 where future generations will come not only to live but to live the good life And I 
 understand that if I stayed here tonight I would see that Michigan students are really doing 
 their best to live the good life 
 This is the place where the Peace Corps was started 
 It is inspiring to see how all of you while you are in this country are trying so hard to live at 
 the level of the people 
 A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is in our countryside We have 
 always prided ourselves on being not only America the strong and America the free but 
 America the beautiful Today that beauty is in danger The water we drink the food we eat 
 the very air that we breathe are threatened with pollution Our parks are overcrowded our 
 seashores overburdened Green fields and dense forests are disappearing 
 A few years ago we were greatly concerned about the Ugly American Today we must act to 
 prevent an ugly America 
 For once the battle is lost once our natural splendor is destroyed it can never be recaptured 
 And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his 
 sustenance be wasted 
 A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of America There your children 's 
 lives will be shaped Our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan 
 the farthest reaches of thought and imagination We are still far from that goal Today 8 
 million adult Americans more than the entire population of Michigan have not finished 5 
  
  
 
                               
        
 years of school Nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school Nearly 54 million 
 more than one quarter of all America have not even finished high school 
 Each year more than 100,000 high school graduates with proved ability do not enter college 
 because they can not afford it And if we can not educate today 's youth what will we do in 
 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960 And high school 
 enrollment will rise by 5 million And college enrollment will   3 million 
 In many places classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated Most of our qualified 
 teachers are underpaid and many of our paid teachers are unqualified So we must give every 
 child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from Poverty must not be a bar to learning and 
 learning must offer an escape from poverty 
 But more classrooms and more teachers are not enough We must seek an educational 
 system which grows in excellence as it grows in size This means better training for our 
 teachers It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of 
 labor It means exploring new techniques of teaching to find new ways to stimulate the love 
 of learning and the capacity for creation 
 These are three of the central issues of the Great Society While our Government has many 
 programs directed at those issues I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those 
 problems But I do promise this We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest 
 knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for America 
 I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of White House conferences and 
 meetings on the cities on natural beauty on the quality of education and on other 
 emerging challenges And from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these 
 studies we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society 
 The solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in Washington nor can it 
 rely solely on the strained resources of local authority They require us to create new concepts 
 of cooperation a creative federalism between the National Capital and the leaders of local 
 communities 
 Woodrow Wilson once wrote Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his 
 Nation as well as a man of his time 
  
  
 
                               
        
 Within your lifetime powerful forces already loosed will take us toward a way of life beyond 
 the realm of our experience almost beyond the bounds of our imagination 
 For better or for worse your generation has been   deal with those 
 problems and to lead America toward a new age You have the chance never before afforded 
 to any people in any age You can help build a society where the demands of morality and the 
 needs of the spirit can be realized in the life of the Nation 
 So will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the 
 law requires whatever his belief or race or the color of his skin 
 Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty 
 Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace as 
 neighbors and not as mortal enemies 
 Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society to prove that our material progress is 
 only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit 
 There are those timid souls that say this battle can not be won that we are condemned to a 
 soulless wealth I do not agree We have the power to shape the civilization that we want But 
 we need your will and your labor and your hearts if we are to build that kind of society 
 Those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country They sought a 
 new world So I have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision 
 our reality So let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back 
 and say It was then after a long and weary way that man turned the exploits of his genius 
 to the full enrichment of his life

31,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,First Inaugural Address,1933," 
 
 2    
 PPPPresident Hoover Mr. Chief Justice my friends 
 This is a day of national consecration And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans 
 expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a 
 decision which the present situation of our people impels 
 This is preeminently the time to speak the truth the whole truth frankly and boldly Nor need 
 we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today This great Nation will endure 
 as it has endured will revive and will prosper 
 So first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself 
 nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat 
 into advance In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor 
 has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to 
 victory And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical 
 days 
  
  
 
            
 In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties They concern thank 
 God only material things Values have shrunk to fantastic levels taxes have risen our ability 
 to pay has fallen government of all kinds is   of income the 
 means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade the withered leaves of industrial 
 enterprise lie on every side farmers find no markets for their produce and the savings of 
 many years in thousands of families are gone More important a host of unemployed citizens 
 face the grim problem of existence and an equally great number toil with little return Only a 
 foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment 
 And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance We are   of 
 locusts Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and 
 were not afraid we have still much to be thankful for Nature still offers her bounty and 
 human efforts have multiplied it Plenty is at our doorstep but a generous use of it languishes 
 in the very sight of the supply 
 Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind 's goods have failed through 
 their own stubbornness and their own incompetence have admitted their failure and have 
 abdicated Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public 
 opinion   and minds of men 
 True they have tried But their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition 
  credit they have proposed only the lending of more money Stripped of the 
 lure of   induce our people to follow their false leadership they have resorted 
 to exhortations pleading tearfully for restored confidence They only know the rules of a 
 generation of self seekers They have no vision and when there is no vision the people 
 perish 
 Yes the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization We 
 may now restore that temple to the ancient truths The measure of that restoration lies in the 
 extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit 
 Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money it lies in the joy of achievement in the 
 thrill of creative effort The joy the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in 
 the mad chase of evanescent profits These dark days my friends will be worth all they cost 
 us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to 
 ourselves to our fellow men 
  
  
 
            
 Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand 
 with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be 
 valued   of pride of place and personal profit and there must be an end 
 to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the 
 likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing Small wonder that confidence languishes for it 
 thrives only on honesty on honor on the sacredness of obligations on faithful protection and 
 on unselfish performance without them it can not live 
 Restoration calls however not for changes in ethics alone This Nation is asking for action 
 and action now 
 Our greatest primary task is to put people to work This is no unsolvable problem if we face it 
 wisely and courageously It can be accomplished in   by the 
 Government itself treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war but at the 
 same time through this employment accomplishing great greatly needed projects to 
 stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural resources 
 Hand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our 
 industrial centers  a national scale in a redistribution endeavor to provide 
 a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land 
 
 Yes the task can be   to raise the values of agricultural products and 
 with this the power to purchase the output of our cities It can be helped by preventing 
 realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our 
 farms It can be   the Federal the State and the local governments 
 act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced It can be helped by the 
 unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered uneconomical unequal It can be 
  for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of 
 communications and other utilities that have a definitely public character There are many 
 ways in which it can be helped but it can never be   about it 
 We must act We must act quickly 
 And finally in our progress towards a resumption of work we require two safeguards against 
 a return of the evils of the old order There must be a strict supervision of all banking and 
 credits and investments There must be an end to speculation with other people 's money And 
 there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency 
  
  
 
            
 These my friends are the lines of attack I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in 
 special session detailed measures for their fulfillment and I shall seek the immediate 
 assistance of the 48 States 
 Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in 
 order and making income balance outgo Our international trade relations though vastly 
 important are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound 
 national economy I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first I shall spare no 
 effort to restore world   readjustment but the emergency at 
 home can not wait on that accomplishment 
 The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not nationally 
 narrowly nationalistic It is the insistence as a first consideration upon the interdependence 
 of the various elements in and parts of the United States of America a recognition of the old 
 and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer It is the way 
 to recovery It is the immediate way It is the strongest assurance that recovery will endure 
 In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor the 
 neighbor who resolutely respects himself and because he does so respects the rights of 
 others the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements 
 in and with a world of neighbors 
 If I read the temper of our people correctly we now realize as we have never realized before 
 our interdependence on each other that we can not merely take but we must give as well 
 that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for 
 the good of a common discipline because without such discipline no progress can be made 
 no leadership becomes effective 
 We are I know ready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline 
 because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good This I propose to offer 
 pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us bind upon us all as a sacred obligation 
 with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife 
 With this pledge taken I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our 
 people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems 
 Action in this image action to this end is feasible under the form of government which we 
 have inherited from our ancestors Our Constitution is so simple so practical that it is possible 
  
  
 
            
 always to meet extraordinary   emphasis and arrangement without loss of 
 essential form That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly 
 enduring political mechanism the modern world has ever seen 
 It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory of foreign wars of bitter internal strife 
 of world relations And it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative 
 authority may be wholly equal wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us 
 But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for 
 temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure 
 I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken 
 nation in the midst of a stricken world may require These measures or such other measures 
 as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom I shall seek within my 
 constitutional authority to bring to speedy adoption 
 But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses in the event 
 that the national emergency is still critical I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will 
 then confront me I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis 
 broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that 
 would be given to me if we were in fact   foe 
 
 For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time I 
 can do no less 
 We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity with the 
 clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values with the clean satisfaction that 
 comes from the stern performance of   young alike We aim at the assurance of 
 a rounded a permanent national life 
 We do not distrust the the future of essential democracy The people of the United States 
 have not failed In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct vigorous 
 action They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership They have made me the 
 present instrument of their wishes In the spirit of the gift I take it

32,Newton Minow,Television and the Public Interest,1961," 
 
 
 Governor Collins distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen Governor Collins you 're much 
 too kind as all of you have been to me the last few days It 's been a great pleasure and an 
 honor for me to meet so many of you And I want to thank you for this opportunity to meet 
 with you today 
 As you know this is my first public address since I took over my new job When the New 
 Frontiersmen rode into town I locked myself in my office to do my homework and get my feet 
 wet But apparently I have n't managed yet to stay out of hot water I seem to have detected 
 a very nervous apprehension about what I might say or do when I emerged from that locked 
 office for this my maiden station break 
 So first let me   rumor I was not picked for this job because I regard 
 myself as the fastest draw on the New Frontier Second let me start a rumor Like you I have 
 carefully read President Kennedy 's messages about the regulatory agencies conflict of 
 interest and the dangers of ex parte contacts And of course we at the Federal 
 Communications Commission will do our part Indeed I may even suggest that we change the 
 name of the FCC to The Seven Untouchables 
  
  
 
                    
       
 It may also come as a surprise to some of you but I want you to know that you have my 
 admiration and my respect Yours is a most honorable profession Anyone who is in the 
 broadcasting business has a tough row to hoe You earn your   property 
 When you work in broadcasting you volunteer for public service public pressure and public 
 regulation You must compete with other attractions and other investments and the only way 
 you can do it is to prove to us every three years that you should have been in business in the 
 first place 
 I can think of easier ways to make a living 
 But I can not think of more satisfying ways 
 I admire your courage but that does n't mean that I would make life any easier for you 
 Your license lets you use the public 's airwaves as trustees for 180 million Americans The 
 public is your beneficiary If you want to stay on as trustees you must deliver a decent return 
 to the public not only to your stockholders So as a representative of the public your 
 health and your product are among my chief concerns 
 Now as to your health let 's talk only of television today 1960 gross broadcast revenues of 
 the television industry were over 1,268,000,000 dollars Profit before taxes was 243,900,000 
 dollars an average return on revenue of 19.2 per cent Compare these with 1959 when gross 
 broadcast revenues were 1,163,900,000 dollars and profit before taxes was 222,300,000 an 
 average return on revenue of 19.1 per cent So the percentage increase of total revenues 
 from 59 to 60 was 9 per cent and the percentage increase of profit was 9.7 per cent This 
 despite a recession throughout the country For your investors the price has indeed been 
 right 
 So I have confidence in your health but not in your product It is with this and much more in 
 mind that I come before you today 
 One editorialist in the trade press wrote that the FCC of the New Frontier is going to be one 
 of the toughest FCC 's in the history of broadcast regulation If he meant that we intend to 
 enforce the law in the public interest let me make it perfectly clear that he is right We do If 
 he meant that we intend to muzzle or censor broadcasting he is dead wrong It would n't 
 surprise me if some of you had expected me to come here today and say to you in effect 
 Clean up your own house or the government will do it for you Well in a limited sense you 
 would be right because I 've just said it 
  
  
 
                    
       
 But I want to say to you as earnestly as I can that it is not in that spirit that I come before 
 you today nor is it in that spirit that I intend to serve the FCC I am in Washington to help 
 broadcasting not to harm it to strengthen it not weaken it to reward it not to punish it to 
 encourage it not threaten it and to stimulate it not censor it Above all I am here to uphold 
 and protect the public interest 
 Now what do we  interest Some say the public interest is merely what 
 interests the public I disagree And so does your distinguished president Governor Collins In 
 a recent speech and of course as I also told you yesterday In a recent speech he said 
 Broadcasting to serve the public interest must have a soul and a conscience a burning 
 desire to excel as well as to sell the urge to build the character citizenship and 
 intellectual stature of people as well as to expand the gross national product By no 
 means do I imply that broadcasters disregard the public interest But a much better 
 job can be done and should be done 
 I could not agree more with Governor Collins And I would add that in today 's world with 
 chaos in Laos and the Congo aflame with Communist tyranny on our Caribbean doorstep 
 relentless pressures on our Atlantic alliance with social and economic problems at home of 
 the gravest nature yes and with the technological knowledge that makes it possible as our 
 President has said not only to destroy our world but to destroy poverty around the world in 
 a time of peril and opportunity the old complacent unbalanced fare of action adventure and 
 situation comedies is simply not good enough 
 Your industry possesses the most powerful voice in America It has an inescapable duty to 
 make that voice ring with intelligence and with leadership In a few years this exciting 
 industry has grown from a novelty to an instrument of overwhelming impact on the American 
 people It should be making ready for the kind of leadership that newspapers and magazines 
 assumed years ago to make our people aware of their world 
 Ours has been called the jet age the atomic age the space age It is also I submit the 
 television age And just as history will decide whether the leaders of today 's world employed 
 the atom to destroy the world or rebuild it for mankind 's benefit so will history decide 
 whether today 's broadcasters employed their powerful voice to enrich the people or to debase 
 them 
 
  
  
 
                    
       
 If I seem today to address myself chiefly to the problems of television I do n't want any of you 
 radio broadcasters to think that we 've gone to sleep at your switch We have n't We still 
 listen But in recent years most of the controversies and cross currents in broadcast 
 programming have swirled around television And so my subject today is the television 
 industry and the public interest 
 Like everybody I wear more than one hat I am the chairman of the FCC But I am also a 
 television viewer and the husband and father of other television viewers I have seen a great 
 many television programs that seemed to me eminently worthwhile and I am not talking 
 about the much bemoaned good old days of Playhouse 90 and Studio One 
 I 'm talking about this past season Some were wonderfully entertaining such as The 
 Fabulous Fifties The Fred Astaire Show and The Bing Crosby Special some were 
 dramatic and moving such as Conrad 's Victory and Twilight Zone some were marvelously 
 informative such as The Nation 's Future CBS Reports The Valiant Years I could list 
 many more programs that I am sure everyone here felt enriched his own life and that of his 
 family When television is good nothing not the theater not the magazines or newspapers 
 nothing is better 
 But when television is bad nothing is worse I invite each of you to sit down in front of your 
 television set when your station goes on the air and stay there for a day without a book 
 without a magazine without a newspaper without a profit and loss sheet or a rating book to 
 distract you Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off I can assure you that 
 what you will observe is a vast wasteland 
 You will see a procession of game shows formula comedies about totally unbelievable 
 families blood and thunder mayhem violence sadism murder western bad men western 
 good men private eyes gangsters more violence and cartoons And endlessly commercials 
 many screaming cajoling and offending And most of all boredom True you 'll see a few 
 things you will enjoy But they will be very very few And if you think I exaggerate I only ask 
 you to try it 
 Is there one person in this room who claims that broadcasting ca n't do better Well a glance 
 at next season 's proposed programming can give us little heart Of 73 and 1/2 hours of prime 
 evening time the networks have tentatively scheduled 59 hours of categories of action- 
 adventure situation comedy variety quiz and movies 
  
  
 
                    
       
 Is there one network president in this room who claims he ca n't do better Well is there at 
 least one network president who believes that the other networks can do better Gentlemen 
 your trust accounting with your beneficiaries is long overdue Never have so few owed so 
 much to so many 
 Why is so much of television so bad I 've heard many answers demands of your advertisers 
 competition for ever higher ratings the need always to attract a mass audience the high cost 
 of television programs the insatiable appetite for programming material These are some of 
 the reasons Unquestionably these are tough problems not susceptible to easy answers But I 
 am not convinced that you have tried hard enough to solve them 
 I do not accept the idea that the present over all programming is aimed accurately at the 
 public taste The ratings tell us only that some people have their television sets turned on and 
 of that number so many are tuned to one channel and so many to another They do n't tell us 
 what the public might watch if they were offered half a dozen additional choices A rating at 
 best is an indication of how many people saw what you gave them Unfortunately it does not 
 reveal the depth of the penetration or the intensity of reaction and it never reveals what the 
 acceptance would have been if what you gave them had been better if all the forces of art 
 and creativity and daring and imagination had been unleashed I believe in the people 's good 
 sense and good taste and I am not convinced that the people 's taste is as low as some of you 
 assume 
 My concern with the rating services is not with their accuracy Perhaps they are accurate I 
 really do n't know What then is wrong with the ratings It 's not been their accuracy it 's 
 been their use 
 Certainly I hope you will agree that ratings should have little influence where children are 
 concerned The best estimates indicate that during the hours of 5 to 6 P.M. sixty per cent of 
 your audience is composed of children under twelve And most young children today believe 
 it or not spend as much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom I repeat let 
 that sink in ladies and gentlemen most young children today spend as much time watching 
 television as they do in the schoolroom It used to be said that there were three great 
 influences on a child home school and church Today there is a fourth great influence and 
 you ladies and gentlemen in this room control it 
 
  
  
 
                    
       
 If parents teachers and ministers conducted their   ratings 
 children would have a steady diet of ice cream school holidays and no Sunday school What 
 about your responsibilities Is there no room on television to teach to inform to uplift to 
 stretch to enlarge the capacities of our children Is there no room for programs deepening 
 their understanding of children in other lands Is there no room for a children 's news show 
 explaining something to them about the world at their level of understanding Is there no 
 room for reading the great literature of the past for teaching them the great traditions of 
 freedom There are some fine children 's shows but they are drowned out in the massive 
 doses of cartoons violence and more violence Must these be your trademarks Search your 
 consciences and see if you can not offer more to your young beneficiaries whose future you 
 guide so many hours each and every day 
 Now what about adult programming and ratings You know newspaper publishers take 
 popularity ratings too And the answers are pretty clear It is almost always the comics 
  But ladies and gentlemen the news is still on the 
 front page of all newspapers the editorials are not and the 
 newspapers have not become one long collection of advice to the lovelorn Yet newspapers do 
 not even need a license from the government to be in business they do not use public 
 property But in television where your responsibilities as public trustees are so plain the 
 moment that the ratings indicate that westerns are popular there are new imitations of 
 westerns on the air faster than the old coaxial cable could take us from Hollywood to New 
 York Broadcasting can not continue to   Ratings ought to be the slave of 
 the broadcaster not his master And you and I both know You and I both know that the 
 rating services themselves would agree 
 Let me make clear that what I am talking about is balance I believe that the public interest is 
 made up of many interests There are many people in this great country and you must serve 
 all of us You will get no argument from me if you say that given a choice between a western 
 and a symphony more people will watch the western I like westerns too but a steady diet 
 for the whole country is obviously not in the public interest We all know that people would 
 more often prefer to be entertained than stimulated or informed But your obligations are not 
 satisfied if you look only to popularity as a test of what to broadcast You are not only in show 
 business you are free to communicate ideas as well as relaxation 
 And as Governor Collins said to you yesterday when he encouraged you to editorialize as 
 you know the FCC has now encouraged editorializing for years We want you to do this we 
 want you to editorialize take positions 
  
  
 
                    
       
 We only ask that you do it in a fair and a responsible manner Those stations that have 
 editorialized have demonstrated to you that the FCC will always encourage a fair and 
 responsible clash of opinion  
 You must provide a wider range of choices more diversity more alternatives It is not enough 
 to cater to the nation 's whims you must also serve the nation 's needs And I would add this 
 that if some of you persist in a relentless search for the highest rating and the lowest common 
 denominator you may very well lose your audience Because to paraphrase a great American 
 who was recently my law partner the people are wise wiser than some of the broadcasters 
 and politicians think 
 As you may have gathered I would like to see television improved But how is this to be 
 brought about By voluntary   themselves By direct government 
 intervention Or how 
 Let me address myself now to my role not as a viewer but as chairman of the FCC I could not 
 if I would chart for you this afternoon in detail all of the actions I contemplate Instead I 
 want to make clear some of the fundamental principles which guide me 
 First the people own the air And they own it as much in prime evening time as they do at six 
 o'clock Sunday morning For every hour that the people give you you owe them something 
 And I intend to see that your debt is paid with service 
 Second I think it would be foolish and wasteful for us to continue any worn out wrangle over 
 the problems of payola rigged quiz shows and other mistakes of the past There are laws on 
 the books which we will enforce But there is no chip on my shoulder We live together in 
 perilous uncertain times we face together staggering problems and we must not waste 
 much time   clichés of past controversy To quarrel over the past is to 
 lose the future 
 Third I believe in the free enterprise system I want to I want to see broadcasting 
 improved and I want you to do the job I am proud to champion your cause It is not rare for 
 American businessmen to serve a public trust Yours is a special trust because it is imposed by 
 law 
 
  
  
 
                    
       
 Fourth I will do all I can to help educational television There are still not enough educational 
 stations and major centers of the country still lack usable educational channels If there were 
 a limited number of printing presses in this country you may be sure that a fair proportion of 
 them would be put to educational use Educational television has an enormous contribution to 
 make to the future and I intend to give it a hand along the way If there is not a nation wide 
 educational television system in this country it will not be the fault of the FCC 
 Fifth I am unalterably opposed to governmental censorship There will be no suppression of 
 programming which does not meet with bureaucratic tastes Censorship strikes at the tap root 
 of our free society 
 Sixth I did not come to Washington to idly observe the squandering of the public 's airwaves 
 The squandering of our airwaves is no less important than the lavish waste of any precious 
 natural resource I intend to take the job of chairman of the FCC very seriously I happen to 
 believe in the gravity of my own particular sector of the New Frontier There will be times 
 perhaps when you will consider that I take myself or my job too seriously Frankly I do n't 
 care if you do For I am convinced that either one takes this job seriously or one can be 
 seriously taken 
 Now how will these principles be applied Clearly at the heart of the FCC 's authority lies its 
 power to license to renew or fail to renew or to revoke a license As you know when your 
 license comes up for renewal your performance is compared with your promises I 
 understand that many people feel that in the past licenses were often renewed pro forma I 
 say to you now renewal will not be pro forma in the future There is nothing permanent or 
 sacred about a broadcast license 
 But simply matching promises and performance is not enough I intend to do more I intend to 
 find out whether the people care I intend to find out whether the community which each 
 broadcaster serves believes he has been serving the public interest When a renewal is set 
 down for a hearing I intend whenever possible to hold a well advertised public hearing right 
 in the community you have promised to serve I want the people who own the air and the 
 homes that television enters to tell you and the FCC what 's been going on I want the people 
 if they 're truly interested in the service you give them to make notes document cases 
 tell us the facts And for those few of you who really believe that the public interest is merely 
 what interests the public I hope that these hearings will arouse no little interest 
 
  
  
 
                    
       
 The FCC has a fine reserve of monitors almost 180 million Americans gathered around 56 
 million sets If you want those monitors to be your friends at court it 's up to you 
 Now some of you may say Yes but I still do not know where the line is between a grant of a 
 renewal and the hearing you just spoke of My answer is Why should you want to know how 
 close you can come to the edge of the cliff What the Commission asks of you is to make a 
 conscientious good faith effort to serve the public interest Everyone of you serves a 
 community in which the people would  religious instructive and 
 other public service programming Every one of you serves an area which has local needs 
 as to local elections controversial issues local news local talent Make a serious genuine 
 effort to put on that programming And when you do you will not be playing brinkmanship 
 with the public interest 
 Now what I 've been saying applies to the broadcast stations Now a station break for the 
 networks and will last even longer than 40 seconds You networks know your importance in 
 this great industry Today more than one half of all hours of television station programming 
 comes from the networks in prime time this rises to more than three fourths of the available 
 hours 
 You know that the FCC has been studying network operations for some time I intend to press 
 this to a speedy conclusion with useful results I can tell you right now however that I am 
 deeply concerned with concentration of power in the hands of the networks As a result too 
 many local stations have foregone any efforts at local programming with little use of live 
 talent and local service Too many local stations operate with one hand on the network switch 
 and the other on a projector loaded with old movies We want the individual stations to be 
 free to meet their legal responsibilities to serve their communities 
 I join Governor Collins in his views so well expressed to the advertisers who use the public air 
 And I urge the networks to join him and undertake a very special mission on behalf of this 
 industry You can tell your advertisers This is the high quality we are going to serve take 
 it or other people will If you think you can find a better place to move automobiles 
 cigarettes and soap then go ahead and try Tell your sponsors to be less concerned with 
 costs per thousand and more concerned with understanding per millions And remind your 
 stockholders that an investment in broadcasting is buying a share in public responsibility The 
 networks can start this industry on the road to freedom from the dictatorship of numbers 
 
  
  
 
                    
       0 
 But there is more to the problem than network influences on stations or advertiser influences 
 on networks I know the problems networks face in trying to clear some of their best 
 programs the informational programs that exemplify public service They are your finest 
 hours whether sustaining or commercial whether regularly scheduled or special These are 
 the signs that broadcasting knows the way to leadership They make the public 's trust in you 
 a wise choice 
 They should be seen As you know we are readying for use new  
 stations will report their programming to the Commission You probably also know that special 
 attention will be paid in these forms to reports of public service programming I believe that 
 stations taking network service should also be required to report the extent of the local 
 clearance of network public service programs and when they fail to clear them they should 
 explain why If it is to put on some outstanding local program this is one reason But if it is 
 simply to run an old movie that 's an entirely different matter And the Commission should 
 consider such clearance reports carefully when making up its mind about the licensee 's over- 
 all programming 
 We intend to move and as you know and as I want to say publicly the FCC was rapidly 
 moving in other new areas before the new Administration arrived in Washington And I want 
 to pay my public respects to my very able predecessor Fred Ford and to my colleagues on 
 the Commission each of whom has welcomed me to the FCC with warmth and cooperation 
 We have approved an experiment with pay TV and in New York we are testing the potential of 
 UHF broadcasting Either or both of these may revolutionize television Only a foolish prophet 
 would venture to guess the direction they will take and their effect But we intend that they 
 shall be explored fully for they are part of broadcasting 's New Frontier The questions 
 surrounding pay TV are largely economic The questions surrounding UHF are largely 
 technological We are going to give the infant the infant pay TV a chance to prove whether 
 it can offer a useful service we are going to protect it from those who would strangle it in its 
 crib 
 As for UHF I 'm sure you know about our test in the canyons of New York City We will take 
 every possible positive step to break through the allocations barrier into UHF We will put this 
 sleeping giant to use and in the years ahead we may have twice as many channels operating 
 in cities where now there are only two or three We may have a half dozen networks instead 
 of three 
  
  
 
                    
       1 
 I have told you that I believe in the free enterprise system I believe that most of television 's 
 problems stem from lack of competition This is the importance of UHF to me with more 
 channels on the air we will be able to provide every community with enough stations to offer 
 service to all parts of the public Programs with a mass market appeal required by mass 
 product advertisers certainly will still be available But other stations will recognize the need to 
 appeal to more limited markets and to special tastes In this way we can all have a much 
 wider range of programs Television should thrive on this competition and the country should 
 benefit from alternative sources of service to the public And Governor Collins I hope the 
 NAB will benefit from many new members 
 Another and perhaps the most important frontier Television will rapidly join the parade into 
 space International television will be with us soon No one knows how long it will be until a 
 broadcast from a studio in New York will be viewed in India as well as in Indiana will be seen 
 in the Congo as it is seen in Chicago But as surely as we are meeting here today that day 
 will come and once again our world will shrink 
 What will the people of other countries think of us when they see our western bad men and 
 good men punching each other in the jaw in between the shooting What will the Latin 
 American or African child learn of America from this great communications industry We 
 can not permit television in its present form to be our voice overseas  
 There is your challenge to leadership You must reexamine some fundamentals of your 
 industry You must open your minds and open your hearts to the limitless horizons of 
 tomorrow I can suggest some words that should serve to guide you 
 Television and all who participate in it are jointly accountable to the American public for 
 respect for the special needs of children for community responsibility for the 
 advancement of education and culture for the acceptability of the program materials 
 chosen for decency and decorum in production and for propriety in advertising This 
 responsibility can not be   group of programs but can be 
 discharged only through the highest standards of respect for the American home 
 applied to every moment of every program presented by television 
 Program materials should enlarge the horizons of the viewer provide him with wholesome 
 entertainment afford helpful stimulation and remind him of the responsibilities which the 
 citizen has towards his society 
  
  
 
                    
       2 
 Now those are not my words They are yours They are taken literally verbatim from your 
 own Television Code They reflect the leadership and aspirations of your own great industry I 
 urge you to respect them as I do And I urge you to respect the intelligent and farsighted 
 leadership of Governor LeRoy Collins and to make this meeting a creative act I urge you at 
 this meeting and after you leave back home at your stations and your networks to strive 
 ceaselessly to improve your product and to better serve your viewers the American people 
 I hope that we at the FCC will not allow ourselves to become so bogged down in the mountain 
 of papers hearings memoranda orders and the daily routine that we close our eyes to this 
 wider view of the public interest And I hope that you broadcasters will not permit yourselves 
 to become so absorbed in the daily chase for ratings sales and profits that you lose this 
 wider view Now more than ever before in broadcasting 's history the times demand the best of 
 all of us 
 We need imagination in programming not sterility creativity not imitation experimentation 
 not conformity excellence not mediocrity Television is filled with creative imaginative 
 people You must strive to set them free 
 Television in its young life has had many hours of greatness its Victory at Sea its Army- 
 McCarthy hearings its Peter Pan its Kraft Theaters its See It Now its Project 20 the 
 World Series its political conventions and campaigns and the Great Debates And it 's had its 
 endless hours of mediocrity and its moments of public disgrace There are estimates today 
 that the average viewer spends about 200 minutes daily with television while the average 
 reader spends 38 minutes with magazines 40 minutes with newspapers Television has grown 
 faster than a teenager and now it is time to grow up 
 What you gentlemen broadcast through the people 's air affects the people 's taste their 
 knowledge their opinions their understanding of themselves and of their world and their 
 future 
 Just think for a moment of the impact of broadcasting in the past few days Yesterday was 
 one of the great days of my life Last week the President asked me to ride over with him when 
 he came to speak here at the NAB And when I went to the White House he said Do you 
 think it would be a good idea to take Commander Shepard And of course I said it would be 
 magnificent And I was privileged to ride here yesterday in a car with the President and the 
 Vice President Commander and Mrs. Shepard This was an unexpected unscheduled stop 
  
  
 
                    
       3 
 And Commander Shepard said to me Where are we going What is this group And I said 
 This is the National Association of Broadcasters at its annual convention 
 This is the group this is the industry that made it possible for millions of Americans to share 
 with you that great moment in history that his gallant flight was  
 anxious Americans who saw in it an intimacy which they could achieve through no other 
 medium in no other way It was one of your finest hours The depth of broadcasting 's 
 contribution to public understanding of that event can not be measured And it thrilled me 
 as a representative of the government that deals with this industry to say to Commander 
 Shepard the group that he was about to see 
 I say to you ladies and gentlemen I remind you what the President said in his stirring 
 inaugural He said Ask not what America can do for you ask what you can do for America.¹ I 
 say to you ladies and gentlemen Ask not what broadcasting can do for you ask what you can 
 do for broadcasting And ask what broadcasting can do for America 
 I urge you I urge you to put the people 's airwaves to the service of the people and the cause 
 of freedom You must help prepare a generation for great decisions You must help a great 
 nation fulfill its future 
 Do this I pledge you our help 
 Thank you

33,Richard M. Nixon,Resignation Address to the Nation,1974," 
 
 
 Good evening 
 This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have 
 been made that shape the history of this nation Each time I have done so to discuss with you 
 some matter that I believe affected the national interest In all the decisions I have made in 
 my public life I have always tried to do what was best for the nation 
 Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate I have felt it was my duty to persevere 
 to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me In the 
 past few days however it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough 
 political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort As long as there was such a 
 base I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its 
 conclusion that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult 
 process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future But with the disappearance 
 of that base I now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served And there is no 
 longer a need for the process to be prolonged 
  
  
 
                                         
 I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would 
 have involved and my family unanimously urged me to do so But the interests of the nation 
 must always come before any personal considerations From the discussions I have had with 
 Congressional and other leaders I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I 
 might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very 
 difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation 
 will require 
 I have never been a quitter 
 To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body But as 
 President I must put the interests of America first 
 America needs a full time President and a full time Congress particularly at this time with 
 problems we face at home and abroad To continue to fight through the months ahead for my 
 personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President 
 and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace 
 abroad and prosperity without inflation at home 
 Therefore I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow 
 Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office 
 As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term I feel a great 
 sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in 
 the next two and a half years But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice 
 President Ford I know as I told the nation when I nominated him for that office ten months 
 ago that the leadership of America would be in good hands 
 In passing this office to the Vice President I also do so with the profound sense of the weight 
 of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow and therefore of the understanding 
 the patience the cooperation he will need from all Americans As he assumes that 
 responsibility he will deserve the help and the support of all of us As we look to the future 
 the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this nation To put the bitterness and 
 divisions of the recent past behind us and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the 
 heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people 
  
  
 
                                         
 By taking this action I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing 
 which is so desperately needed in America I regret deeply any injuries that may have been 
 done in the course of the events that led to this decision I would say only that if some of my 
 judgments were wrong and some were wrong they were made in what I believed at the 
 time to be the best interests of the nation 
 To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months to my family my friends 
 the many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right I will 
 be eternally grateful for your support And to those who have not felt able to give me your 
 support let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me because all 
 of us in the final analysis have been concerned with the good of the country however our 
 judgments might differ 
 So let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new 
 President succeed for the benefit of all Americans I shall leave this office with regret at not 
 completing my term but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the 
 past five and a half years These years have been a momentous time in the history of our 
 nation and the world They have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud 
 achievements that represent the shared efforts of the administration the Congress and the 
 people But the challenges ahead are equally great And they too will require the support and 
 the efforts of the Congress and the people working in cooperation with the new 
 Administration 
 We have ended America 's longest war But in the work of securing a lasting peace in the 
 world the goals ahead are even more far reaching and more difficult We must complete a 
 structure of peace so that it will be said of this generation our generation of Americans 
 by the people of all nations not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future 
 wars 
 We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States 
 and the People 's Republic of China We must now insure that the one quarter of the world 's 
 people who live in the People 's Republic of China will be and remain not our enemies but our 
 friends 
 In the Middle East 100 million people in the Arab countries many of whom have considered 
 us their enemy for nearly 20 years now look on us as their friends We must continue to build 
 on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the Middle East and so that the cradle 
 of civilization will not become its grave Together with the Soviet Union we have made the 
  
  
 
                                         
 crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limiting nuclear arms But we must set 
 as our goal not just limiting but reducing and finally destroying these terrible weapons so 
 that they can not destroy civilization And so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hang 
 over the world and the people We have opened a new relation with the Soviet Union We 
 must continue to develop and expand   that new relationship so that the two strongest nations 
 of the world will live together in cooperation rather than confrontation 
 Around the world in Asia in Africa in Latin America in the Middle East there are millions 
 of people who live in terrible poverty even starvation We must keep as our goal turning away 
 from production for war and expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on 
 this earth can at last look forward in their children 's time if not in our own time to having 
 the necessities for a decent life Here in America we are fortunate that most of our people 
 have not only the blessings of liberty but also the means to live full and good and by the 
 world 's standards even abundant lives 
 We must press on however toward a goal not only of more and better jobs but of full 
 opportunity for every American and of what we are striving so hard right now to achieve 
 prosperity without inflation 
 For more than a quarter of a century in public life I have shared in the turbulent history of 
 this evening I have fought for what I believe in I have tried to the best of my ability to 
 discharge those duties and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me Sometimes 
 I have succeeded And sometimes I have failed But always I have taken heart from what 
 Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is  
 sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because 
 there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed 
 who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy 
 cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and with the 
 worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly 
 I pledge to you tonight that as long as I have a breath of life in my body I shall continue in 
 that spirit I shall continue to work for the great causes to which I have been dedicated 
 throughout my years as a Congressman a Senator Vice President and President the cause of 
 peace not just for America but among all nations prosperity justice and opportunity for 
 all of our people 
 There is one cause above all to which I have been devoted and to which I shall always be 
 devoted for as long as I live 
  
  
 
                                         
 When I first took the oath of office as President five and a half years ago I made this sacred 
 commitment to consecrate my office my energies and all the wisdom I can summon to the 
 cause of peace among nations I 've done my very best in all the days since to be true to that 
 pledge As a result of these efforts I am confident that the world is a safer place today not 
 only for the people of America but for the people of all nations and that all of our children 
 have a better chance than before of living in peace rather than dying in war 
 This more than anything is what I hoped to achieve when I sought the Presidency 
 This more than anything is what I hope will be my legacy to you to our country as I leave 
 the Presidency 
 To have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and 
 every American 
 In leaving it I do so with this prayer May God 's grace be with you in all the days ahead",0.1037602052092552,0.1305036693811416,0.6309194564819336,0.015336905606091,0.0481655001640319,0.0687218904495239,0.0025924062356352,0.0694859307359307,0.5278989401403192,55.27952488041694,0.2874493927125506,0.012351543942992874,0.08553459119496855,0.06576903158984981,30.955882352941178,1.0
34,John F. Kennedy,American University Commencement Address,1963," 
 
 
 President Anderson members of the faculty board of trustees distinguished guests my old 
 colleague Senator Bob Byrd who has earned his degree through many years of attending 
 night law school while I am earning mine in the next 30 minutes distinguished guests ladies 
 and gentlemen  
 It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony of the American University sponsored 
 by the Methodist Church   Fletcher Hurst and first opened by 
 President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 This is a young and growing university but it has already 
 fulfilled Bishop Hurst 's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a city 
 devoted to the making of history and to the conduct of the public 's business By sponsoring 
 this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn whatever their color or their creed 
 the Methodists of this area and the Nation deserve the Nation 's thanks and I commend all 
 those who are today graduating  
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a 
 man of his nation as well as a man of his time and I am confident that the men and women 
 who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives 
 from their talents a high measure of public service and public support There are few earthly 
 things more beautiful than a university wrote John Masefield in his tribute to English 
 universities and his words are equally true today He did not refer to towers or to 
 campuses He admired the splendid beauty of a university because it was he said a place 
 where those who hate ignorance may strive to know where those who perceive truth may 
 strive to make others see  
 I have therefore chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often 
 abounds and the truth too rarely perceived And that is the most important topic on earth 
 peace What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek Not a Pax 
 Americana enforced on the   of war Not the peace of the grave or 
 the security of the slave I am talking about genuine peace the kind of peace that makes life 
 on earth worth living and the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and 
 build a better life for their children not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men 
 and women not merely peace in our time but peace in all time  
 I speak of peace because of the new face of war Total war makes no sense in an age where 
 great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to 
 surrender without resort to those forces It makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear 
 weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force   allied air forces in 
 the Second World War It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a 
 nuclear exchange would be   water and soil and seed to the far corners of 
 the globe and to generations yet unborn  
 Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of 
 making sure we never need them is essential to the keeping of peace But surely the 
 acquisition of such idle stockpiles which can only destroy and never create is not the 
 only much less the most efficient means of assuring peace I speak of peace therefore as 
 the necessary rational end of rational men I realize the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as 
 the pursuit of war and frequently the words of the pursuers fall on deaf ears But we have no 
 more urgent task  
 
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 Some say that it is useless to speak of peace or world law or world disarmament and that it 
 will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude I hope 
 they do I believe we can help them do it But I also believe that we must reexamine our own 
 attitudes as individuals and as a Nation for our attitude is as essential as theirs And every 
 graduate of this school every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring 
 peace  own attitude towards the possibilities 
 of peace towards the Soviet Union towards the course of the cold war and towards freedom 
 and peace here at home  
 First examine our attitude towards peace itself Too many of us think it is impossible Too 
 many think it is unreal But that is a dangerous defeatist belief It leads to the conclusion that 
 war is inevitable that mankind is doomed that we are   can not control 
 We need not accept that view Our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by 
 man And man can be as big as he wants No problem of human destiny is beyond human 
 beings Man 's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable and we believe 
 they can do it again I am not referring to the absolute infinite concept of universal peace and 
 good will of which some fantasies and fanatics dream I do not deny the value of hopes and 
 dreams but we merely invite discouragement and   our only and 
 immediate goal  
 Let us focus instead on a more practical more attainable peace based not on a sudden 
 revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of 
 concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned There is 
 no single simple key to this peace no grand or magic formula to be   two 
 powers Genuine peace must be the product of many nations the sum of many acts It must 
 be dynamic not static changing to meet the challenge of each new generation For peace is a 
 process a way of solving problems  
 With such a peace there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests as there are within 
 families and nations World peace like community peace does not require that each man love 
 his neighbor it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance submitting their 
 disputes to a just and peaceful settlement And history teaches us that enmities between 
 nations as between individuals do not last forever However fixed our likes and dislikes may 
 seem the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between 
 nations and neighbors So let us persevere Peace need not be impracticable and war need 
 not be inevitable By defining our goal more  seem more manageable and 
 less remote we can help all people to see it to draw hope from it and to move irresistibly 
 towards it  
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 And second let us reexamine our attitude towards the Soviet Union It is discouraging to think 
 that their leaders may actually believe what their propagandists write It is discouraging to 
 read a recent authoritative Soviet text on military strategy and find on page after page 
 wholly baseless and incredible claims such as the allegation that American imperialist circles 
 are preparing to unleash different types of war that there is a very real threat of a preventive 
 war being   against the Soviet Union   and that the political 
 aims and I quote of the American imperialists are to enslave economically and politically 
 the European and other capitalist countries and to achieve world  
 aggressive war  
 Truly as it was written long ago The wicked flee when no man pursueth  
 Yet it is sad to read these Soviet statements to realize the extent of the gulf between us But 
 it is also a warning a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap as the 
 Soviets not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side not to see conflict as 
 inevitable accommodation as impossible and communication as nothing more than an 
 exchange of threats  
 No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in 
 virtue As Americans we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal 
 freedom and dignity But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements in 
 science and space in economic and industrial growth in culture in acts of courage  
 Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common none is stronger 
 than our mutual abhorrence of war Almost unique among the major world powers we have 
 never been at war with each other And no nation in the history of battle ever suffered more 
 than the Soviet Union in the Second World War At least 20 million lost their lives Countless 
 millions of homes and families were burned or sacked A third of the nation 's territory 
 including two thirds of its industrial base was turned into a wasteland a loss equivalent to 
 the destruction of this country east of Chicago  
 Today should total war ever break out again no matter how our two countries will be the 
 primary target It is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in 
 the most danger of devastation All we have built all we have worked for would be destroyed 
 in the first 24 hours And even in the cold war which brings burdens and dangers to so many 
 countries including this Nation 's closest allies our two countries bear the heaviest burdens 
 For we are both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to 
 combat ignorance poverty and disease We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous 
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 cycle with suspicion on one side breeding suspicion on the other and new weapons begetting 
 counter weapons In short both the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its 
 allies have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race 
 Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet Union as well as ours And even the 
 most hostile nations can be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations and only 
 those treaty obligations which are in their own interest  
 So let us not be blind to our differences but let us also direct attention to our common 
 interests and the   differences can be resolved And if we can not end 
 now our differences at least we can help make the world safe for diversity For in the final 
 analysis our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet We all breathe 
 the same air We all cherish our children 's futures And we are all mortal  
 Third   let us reexamine our attitude towards the cold war remembering we 're not engaged in 
 a debate seeking to pile up debating points We are not here distributing blame or pointing 
 the finger of judgment We must deal with the world as it is and not as it might have been 
 had the history of the last 18 years been different We must therefore persevere in the 
 search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc might bring 
 within reach solutions which now seem beyond us We must conduct our affairs in such a way 
 that it becomes in the Communists interest to agree on a genuine peace And above all while 
 defending our own vital interests nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring 
 an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war To adopt that kind of 
 course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy or of a 
 collective death wish for the world  
 To secure these ends America 's weapons are nonprovocative carefully controlled designed 
 to deter and capable of selective use Our military forces are committed to peace and 
 disciplined in self restraint Our diplomats are instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and 
 purely rhetorical hostility For we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard 
 And for our part we do not need to use threats to prove we are resolute We do not need to 
 jam foreign broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded We are unwilling to impose our 
 system on any unwilling people but we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition 
 with any people on earth  
 Meanwhile we seek to strengthen the United Nations to help solve its financial problems to 
 make it a more effective instrument for peace to develop it into a genuine world security 
 system a system capable of resolving disputes on the basis of law of insuring the security 
 of the large and the small and of creating conditions under which arms can finally be 
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 abolished At the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non Communist world where 
 many nations all of them our friends are divided over issues which weaken Western unity 
 which invite Communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into war Our efforts in West 
 New Guinea in the Congo in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent have been 
 persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides We have also tried to set an example 
 for  adjust small but significant differences with our own closest 
 neighbors in Mexico and Canada  
 Speaking of other nations I wish to make one point clear We are bound to many nations by 
 alliances Those alliances exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap Our 
 commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin for example stands undiminished 
 because of the identity of our vital interests The United States will make no deal with the 
 Soviet Union at the expense of other nations and other peoples not merely because they are 
 our partners but also because their interests and ours converge Our interests converge 
 however not only in defending the frontiers of freedom but in pursuing the paths of peace It 
 is our hope and the purpose of allied policy to convince the Soviet Union that she too 
 should let each nation choose its own future so long as that choice does not interfere with the 
 choices of others The Communist drive to impose their political and economic system on 
 others is the primary cause of world tension today For there can be no doubt that if all 
 nations could refrain from interfering in the self determination of others the peace would be 
 much more assured  
 This will require a new effort to achieve world law a new context for world discussions It will 
 require increased understanding between the Soviets and ourselves And increased 
 understanding will require increased contact and communication One step in this direction is 
 the proposed arrangement for a direct line between Moscow and Washington to avoid on each 
 side the dangerous delays misunderstandings and misreadings of others actions which might 
 occur at a time of crisis  
 We have also been talking in Geneva about our first step measures of arm[s controls 
 designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and reduce the risk of accidental war Our 
 primary long range interest in Geneva however is general and complete disarmament 
 designed to take  parallel political developments to build the new 
 institutions of peace which would take the place of arms The pursuit of disarmament has 
 been an effort of this Government since the 1920 's It has been urgently  
 three administrations And however dim the prospects are today we intend to continue this 
 effort to continue it in order that all countries including our own can better grasp what the 
 problems and possibilities of disarmament are  
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 The only major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight yet where a fresh start is 
 badly needed is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests The conclusion of such a treaty so near 
 and yet so far would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas It 
 would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest 
 hazards which man faces in 1963 the further spread of nuclear arms It would increase our 
 security it would decrease the prospects of war Surely this goal is sufficiently important to 
 require our steady pursuit yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor 
 the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards  
 I 'm taking this opportunity therefore to announce two important decisions in this regard 
 First Chairman Khrushchev Prime Minister Macmillan and I have agreed that high level 
 discussions will shortly begin in Moscow looking towards early agreement on a comprehensive 
 test ban treaty Our hope must be tempered Our hopes must be tempered with the caution 
 of history but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind Second to make clear our good 
 faith and solemn convictions on this matter I now declare that the United States does not 
 propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as other states do not do so We 
 will not We will not be the first to resume Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal 
 binding treaty but I hope it will help us achieve one Nor would such a treaty be a substitute 
 for disarmament but I hope it will help us achieve it  
 Finally my fellow Americans let us examine our attitude towards peace and freedom here at 
 home The quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our efforts abroad 
 We must show it in the dedication of our own lives as many of you who are graduating 
 today will have an opportunity to  pay in the Peace Corps abroad or in 
 the proposed National Service Corps here at home But wherever we are we must all in our 
 daily lives live up to the age old faith that peace and freedom walk together In too many of 
 our cities today the peace is not secure because freedom is incomplete It is the responsibility 
 of the executive branch at all levels of government local State and National to provide 
 and protect that freedom for all of our   It is the 
 responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels wherever the authority is not now 
 adequate to make it adequate And it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this 
 country to respect the rights of others and respect the law of the land  
 All this All this is not unrelated to world peace When a man 's way[s please the Lord the 
 Scriptures tell us He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him And is not peace in 
 the last analysis basically a matter of human rights the right to live out our lives without fear 
 of devastation the right to breathe air as nature provided it the right of future generations to 
 a healthy existence  
  
  
 
                        
          
          
                            
 While we proceed to safeguard our national interests let us also safeguard human interests 
 And the elimination of war and arms is clearly in the interest of both No treaty however 
 much it may be to the advantage of all however tightly it may be worded can provide 
 absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion But it can if it is sufficiently 
 effective in its enforcement and it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers offer far more 
 security and far fewer risks than an unabated uncontrolled unpredictable arms race  
 The United States as the world knows will never start a war We do not want a war We do 
 not now expect a war This generation of Americans has already had enough more than 
 enough of war and hate and oppression  
 We shall be prepared if others wish it We shall be alert to try to stop it But we shall also do 
 our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just We are not 
 helpless before that task or hopeless of its success Confident and unafraid we must labor on 
 not towards a strategy of annihilation but towards a strategy of peace",0.0099673280492424,0.0088713243603706,0.0068532908335328,0.9142157435417176,0.0472002513706684,0.0066632027737796,0.006228846963495,0.0817156945066428,0.5083765767278703,51.12195948107805,0.2911805879608026,0.010872251050160613,0.08504398826979472,0.04217199558985667,26.27922077922078,1.0
35,Huey P. Long,Share Our Wealth Radio Address to the Nation,1935," 
 Ladies and gentlemen it has been publicly announced that the White House orders of the 
 Roosevelt administration have declared war on HUEY LONG The late and lamented the 
 pampered ex crown prince Gen. Hugh S. Johnson one of those satellites loaned by Wall 
 Street to run the Government and who at the end of his control over and dismissal from the 
 NRA pronounced it as dead as a dodo this Mr. Johnson was apparently selected to make 
 the lead off speech in this White House charge begun last Monday night The Johnson speech 
 was   and fury on behalf of the   and out 
 of Congress 
 In a far away island when a queen dies her first favorite is done the honor to be buried alive 
 with her The funeral procession of the NRA another one of these new deal schisms or isms 
 is about ready to occur It is said that General Johnson 's speech of Monday night to attack me 
 was delivered on the eve of announcing the publication of his obituary in the Red Book 
 Magazine Seems then that soon this erstwhile prince of the deranged alphabet makes ready 
 to appear at the funeral of NRA like unto the colored lady in Mississippi who there asserted I 
 is de wife of dese remains 
 I shall undertake to cover my main subject and make answer to these gentlemen in the 
 course of this speech tonight 
  
  
 
                                                                
 It will serve no purpose to our distressed people for me to call my opponents more bitter 
 names than they call me Even were I able I have not the time to present my side of the 
 argument and match them in billingsgate or profanity 
 What is this trouble with this administration of Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Mr. Hugh S. 
 Johnson Mr. James A. Farley l Mr. Vincent Astor and all their spoilers and spellbinders 
 They think that HUEY LONG is the cause of all their worry They go gunning for me But am I 
 the cause of their misery They are like old Davy Crockett who went out to hunt a possum 
 He saw in the gleam of the moonlight that a possum in the top of a tree was going from limb 
 to limb He shot and missed He saw the possum again He fired a second time and missed 
 again Soon he discovered that it was not a possum he saw at all in the top of that tree It 
 was a louse in his own eyebrow 
 I do not make this illustration to do discredit to any of these gentlemen I make it to show 
 how often we imagine we see great trouble being done to   a distance when 
 in reality all of it may be a fault in our own make up 
 The trouble with the Roosevelt administration is that when their schemes and isms have 
 failed these things I told them not to do and voted not to do that they think it will help them 
 to light out on those of us who warned them in the beginning that the tangled messes and 
 noble experiments would not work The Roosevelt administration has had its way for two 
 years They have been allowed to set up or knock down anything and everybody There was 
 one difference between Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt Hoover could not get the Congress to 
 carry out the schemes he wanted to try We managed to lick him on a roll call in the United 
 States Senate time after time But different with Mr. Roosevelt He got his plans through 
 Congress But on cold analysis they were found to be the same things Hoover tried to pass 
 and failed 
 The kitchen cabinet that sat in to advise Hoover was not different from the kitchen cabinet 
 which advised Roosevelt Many of the persons are the same Many of those in Roosevelt 's 
 kitchen cabinet are of the same men or set of men who furnished employees to sit in the 
 kitchen cabinet to advise Hoover 
 Maybe you see a little change in the man waiting on the tables but back in the kitchen the 
 same set of cooks are fixing up the victuals for us that cooked up the mess under Hoover 
 Why do you think this Roosevelt 's plan for plowing up cotton corn and wheat and for 
 pouring milk in the river and for destroying and burying hogs and all 
  
  
 
                                                                
 while people starve and go naked do you think those plans were the original ideas of this 
 Roosevelt administration If you do you are wrong The whole idea of that kind of thing first 
 came from Hoover 's administration Do n't you remember when Mr. Hoover proposed to plow 
 up every fourth row of cotton We laughed him into scorn President Roosevelt flayed him for 
 proposing such a thing in the speech which he made from the steps of the capitol in Topeka 
 Kans. 
 And so we beat Mr. Hoover on his plan But when Mr. Roosevelt started on his plan it was not 
 to plow up every fourth row of cotton as Hoover tried to do Roosevelt 's plan was to plow up 
 every third row of cotton just one twelfth more cotton to be plowed up than Hoover 
 proposed Roosevelt succeeded in his plan 
 So it has been that while millions have starved and gone naked so it has been that while 
 babies have cried and died for milk so it has been that while people have begged for meat 
 and bread Mr. Roosevelt 's administration has sailed merrily along plowing under and 
 destroying the things to eat and to wear with tear dimmed eyes and hungry souls made to 
 chant for this new deal so that even their starvation dole is not taken away and meanwhile 
 the food and clothes   and souls go for destruction and ruin What is it 
 Is it government Maybe so It looks more like St. Vitus dance 
 Now since they sallied forth with General Johnson to start the war on me let us take a look 
 at this NRA that they opened up around here two years ago They had parades and Fascist 
 signs just as Hitler and Mussolini They started the dictatorship here to regiment business and 
 labor much more than anyone did in Germany or Italy The only difference was in the sign 
 Italy 's sign of the Fascist was a black shirt Germany 's sign of the Fascist was a swastika So 
 in America they sidetracked the Stars and Stripes and the sign of the Blue Eagle was used 
 instead 
 And they proceeded with the NRA Everything from a peanut stand to a power house had to 
 have a separate book of rules and laws to regulate what they did If a peanut stand started to 
 parch a sack of goobers for sale they had to be careful to go through the rule book One slip 
 and he went to jail A little fellow w ho pressed a pair of pants went to jail because he charged 
 5 cents under the price set in the rule book So they wrote their NRA rule book codes laws 
 etc They got up over 900 of them One would be as thick as an unabridged dictionary and as 
 confusing as a study of the stars It would take 40 lawyers to tell a shoe shine stand how to 
 operate and be certain he did n't go to jail 
  
  
 
                                                                
 Some people came to me for advice as a lawyer on how to run business I took several days 
 and then could n't understand it myself The only thing I could tell them was that it could n't be 
 much worse in jail than it was out of jail with that kind of thing going on in the country and 
 so to go on and do the best they could 
 The whole thing of Mr. Roosevelt as run under General Johnson became such a national 
 scandal that Roosevelt had to let Johnson slide out as the scapegoat Let them call for an NRA 
 parade tomorrow and you could n't get enough people to form a funeral march 
 It was under this NRA and the other funny alphabetical combinations which followed it that we 
 ran the whole country into a mares nest The Farleys and Johnsons combed the land with 
 agents inspectors supervisors detectives secretaries assistants etc all armed with the 
 power to arrest and send to jail whomever they found not living up to some rule in one of 
 these 900 catalogs One man whose case reached the Supreme Court of the United States 
 was turned loose because they could n't even find the rule he was supposed to have violated in 
 a search throughout the United States 
 And now it is with PWA 's CWA 's NRA 's AAA 's J UG 's G IN 's and every other flimsy 
 combination that the country finds its affairs and business tangled to where no one can 
 recognize it More men are now out of work than ever the debt of the United States has gone 
 up another $ 10 billion There is starvation there is homelessness there is misery on every 
 hand and corner but mind you in the meantime Mr. Roosevelt has had his way He is one 
 man that ca n't blame any of his troubles on HUEY LONG He has had his way Down in my 
 part of the country if any man has the measles he blames that on me but there is one man 
 that ca n't blame anything on anybody but himself and that is Mr. Franklin De La No 
 Roosevelt 
 And now on top of that they order war on me because nearly 4 years ago I told Hoover 's 
 crowd it would n't do and because 3 years ago I told Roosevelt and his crowd it would n't do In 
 other words they are in a rage at HUEY LONG because I have said I told you so 
 I am not overstating the conditions now prevailing in this country In their own words they 
 have confessed all I now say or ever have said Mr. Roosevelt and even Mrs. Roosevelt have 
 bewailed the fact that food clothes and shelter have not been provided for the people Even 
 Gen. Hugh S. Johnson said in his speech of Monday night that there are 80 million people in 
 America who are badly hurt or   Mr. Harry Hopkins who runs the 
 relief work says the dole roll has risen now to 22,375,000 persons the highest it has ever 
 been And now what is there for the Roosevelt crowd to do but to admit the facts and admit 
  
  
 
                                                                
 further that they are now on their third year making matters worse instead of better all the 
 time No one is to blame except them for what is going on because they have had their way 
 And if they could n't change the thing in over two years now bogged down worse than ever 
 how could anyone expect any good of them hereafter God save us two more years of the 
 disaster we have had under that gang 
 Now my friends when this condition of distress and suffering among so many millions of our 
 people began to develop in the Hoover administration we knew then what the trouble was 
 and what we would have to do to correct it I was the first man to say publicly but Mr. 
 Roosevelt followed in my tracks a few months later and said the same thing We said that all 
 of our trouble and woe was due to the fact that too few of our people owned too much of our 
 wealth We said that in our land with too much to eat and too much to wear and too many 
 houses to live in too many automobiles to be sold that the only trouble was that the people 
 suffered in the land of abundance because too few controlled the money and the wealth and 
 too many did not have money with which to buy the things they needed for life and comfort 
 So I said to the people of the United States in my speeches which I delivered in the United 
 States Senate in the early part of 1932 that the only   could restore our 
 people to reasonable life and comfort was to limit the size of the big man 's fortune and 
 guarantee some minimum to the fortune and comfort of the little man 's family 
 I said then as I have said since that it was inhuman to have food rotting cotton and wool 
 going to waste houses empty and at the same time to have millions of our people starving 
 naked and homeless because they could not buy the things which other men had and for 
 which they had no use whatever So we convinced Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt that it was 
 necessary that he announce and promise to the American people that in the event he were 
 elected President of the United States he would pull down the size of the big man 's fortune 
 and guarantee something to every family enough to do away with all poverty and to give 
 employment to those who were able to work and education to the children born into the 
 world 
 Mr. Roosevelt made those promises he made them before he was nominated in the Chicago 
 convention He made them again before he was elected in November and he went so far as to 
 remake those promises after he was inaugurated President of the United States And I 
 thought for a day or two after he took the oath as President that maybe he was going 
 through with his promises No heart was ever so saddened no person 's ambition was ever so 
 blighted as was mine when I came to the realization that the President of the United States 
  
  
 
                                                                
 was not going to undertake what he had said he would do and what I know to be necessary if 
 the people of America were ever saved from calamity and misery 
 So now my friends I come to that point where I must in a few sentences describe to you just 
 what was the cause of our trouble which became so serious in 1929 and which has been 
 worse ever since The wealth in the United States was three times as much in 1910 as it was 
 in 1890 and yet the masses of our people owned less in 1910 than they did in 1890 
 In the year 1916 the condition had become so bad that a committee provided for by the 
 Congress of the United States reported that 2 percent of the people in the United States 
 owned 60 percent of the wealth in the country and that 65 percent of the people owned less 
 than 5 percent of the wealth This report showed however that there was a middle class 
 some 33 percent of the people who owned 35 percent of the wealth This report went on to 
 say that the trouble with the American people at that time was that too much of the wealth 
 was in the hands of too few of the people and recommended that something be done to 
 correct the evil condition then existing 
 It was at about the same time that many of our publications began to deplore the fact that so 
 few people owned so much and that so many people owned so little Among those 
 commenting upon that situation was the Saturday Evening Post which in an issue of 
 September 23 1916 said 
 Along one statistical line you can figure out a Nation bustling with wealth along 
 another a bloated plutocracy comprising 1 percent of the population lording it over a 
 starving horde with only a thin margin of merely well to do in between 
 And it was as the Saturday Evening Post and the committee it 
 was a deplorable thing back in 1916 when it was found that 2 percent of the people owned 
 twice as much as all of the remainder of the people put together and that 65 percent of all of 
 our people owned practically nothing 
 But what did we do to correct that condition Instead of moving to take these big fortunes 
 from the top and spreading them among the suffering people at the bottom the financial 
 masters of America moved in to take complete charge of the Government for fear our 
 lawmakers might do something along that line 
 And as a result 14 years after the report of 1916 the Federal Trade Commission made a 
 study to see how the wealth of this land was distributed and did they find it still as bad as it 
  
  
 
                                                                
 was in 1916 They found it worse They found that 1 percent of the people owned about 59 
 percent of the wealth which was almost twice as bad as what was said to be an intolerable 
 condition in 1916 when 2 percent of the people owned 60 percent of the wealth And as a 
 result of foreclosures failures and bankruptcies which began to happen prior to and in the 
 year of 1929 before the campaign of 1932 and at this late date it is the estimate of all 
 conservative statisticians that 75 percent of the people in the United States do n't own 
 anything that is not enough to pay their debts and that 4 percent of the people or maybe 
 less than 4 percent of the people own from 85 to 90 percent of all our wealth in the United 
 States 
 Remember in 1916 there was a middle class 33 percent of the people who owned 35 
 percent of the wealth That middle class is practically gone today It no longer exists They 
 have dropped into the ranks of the poor The thriving man of independent business standing is 
 fast fading The corner grocery store is becoming a thing of the past Concentrated chain- 
 merchandise and banking systems have laid waste to all middle opportunity That thin 
 margin of merely well to do in between which the Saturday Evening Post mentioned on 
 September 23 1916 has dwindled to practically no margin of well to do in between Those 
 suffering on the bottom and the few lords of finance on the top are nearly all that are left 
 It became apparent that the billionaires and multimillionaires even began to squeeze out the 
 common millionaires closing in and taking their properties and wrecking their businesses 
 And so we arrived and are still there at the place that in abundant America where we have 
 everything for which a human heart can pray the hundreds of millions or as General 
 Johnson says the 80 million of our people are crying in misery for the want of the things 
 which they need for life notwithstanding the fact that the country has had and can have more 
 than the entire human race can consume 
 The 125 million people of America have seated themselves at the barbecue table to consume 
 the products which have been guaranteed to   and Creator There is 
  what it takes for them all to eat yea more There is provided more 
 than what is needed for all to eat But the financial masters of America have taken off the 
 barbecue table 90 percent of the food placed  the labors of mankind 
 even before the feast begins and there is left on that table to be eaten by 125 million people 
 less than should be there for 10 million of them 
 What has become of the remainder of those things placed on the   for the use 
 of us all They are in the hands of the Morgans the Rockefellers the Mellons the Baruches 
  
  
 
                                                                
 the Bakers the Astors and the Vanderbilts 600 families at the most either possessing or 
 controlling the entire 90 percent of all that is in America They can not eat the food they 
 can not wear the clothes so they destroy it They have it rotted they plow it up they pour it 
 into the rivers they bring destruction through the acts of mankind to let humanity suffer to 
 let humanity go naked to let humanity go homeless so that nothing may occur that will do 
 harm to their vanity and to their greed Like the dog in the manger they command a wagon 
 load of hay which the dog would not allow the cow to eat though he could not eat it himself 
 So now ladies and gentlemen we come to that plan of mine for which I have been so roundly 
 denounced and   as Mr. Farley Mr. Robinson and Gen. Hugh S. 
 Johnson and other spellers and speakers and spoilers of the Roosevelt administration It is for 
 the redistribution of wealth and for guaranteeing comforts and conveniences to all humanity 
 out of this abundance in our country I hope none will be horror stricken when they hear me 
 say that we must limit the size of the big man 's fortune in order to guarantee a minimum of 
 fortune life and comfort to the little man but if you are think first that such is the 
 declaration on which Roosevelt rode into the nomination and election of President While my 
 urgings are   be the average of a madman   as General 
 Johnson as insincere bait of a pied piper if you will listen to me you will find that it is restating 
 the laws handed   man you will find that it was the exact provision of the 
 contract and law of the Pilgrim Fathers who landed at Plymouth in 1620 
 Here 's what the Pilgrim Fathers said in the contract with the early settlers in the year 1620 I 
 read you article 5 from that contract 
 5 That at ye end of ye 7 years ye capital profits viz the houses lands goods and 
 chattels be equally divided betwixt ye adventurers and planters which done every 
 man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detriment concerning this 
 adventure 
 So the Pilgrim Fathers wrote into the covenant to do just exactly what the Bible said to do 
 that they should have an equal division of the wealth every seven years I do n't go that far I 
 merely advocate that no man be allowed to become so big that he makes paupers out of a 
 million other people 
 You will find that it is the cornerstone on which nearly every religion since the beginning of 
 man has been founded You will find that it was  and Shakespeare in 
  Theognis and other wisest of men in  XI in 
 the  's greatest inventor Marconi in  Ralph 
  
  
 
                                                                
 Waldo Emerson Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson William Jennings Bryan and Theodore 
 Roosevelt in the United States as well   of the thousands of great men whose 
 names are yet mentioned in history 
 The principle was not only the mainspring of Roosevelt 's nomination and election but in the 
 closing speech of Herbert Hoover at Madison Square Garden in November 1932 even Hoover 
 said 
 My conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty 
 where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth not concentrated in the hands of a 
 few but diffused through the lives of all 
 And so now I come to give you again that plan taken from these leaders of all times and from 
 the Bible for the sponsoring of which I am labeled America 's menace madman pied piper 
 and demagogue 
 I propose 
 First That every big fortune shall be cut down   levy tax to where no 
 one will own more than a few million dollars as a matter of fact to where no one can very 
 long own a fortune in excess of about three to four millions of dollars I propose that the 
 surplus of all the big fortunes above the few millions to any one person at the most shall go 
 into the United States ownership How would we get all these surplus fortunes into the United 
 States Treasury Not hard to do We would not do   sell what he owned 
 no We would send everyone a questionnaire On that he would list the properties he owns 
 lands and houses stocks and bonds factories and patents and so on Every man would place 
 his appraisal on his property which the Government would review and maybe change on 
 some items On that appraisal the big fortune holder would say out of what property he would 
 retain the few millions allowed to him the balance to go to the United States Say Mr. Henry 
 Ford should allow that he owned all the stock of the Ford Motor Co. worth say $ 2 billion he 
 could claim say $ 4 million of the Ford stock but $ 1,996,000,000 would go to the United 
 States Say the Rockefeller fortune was listed at $ 10 billion in oil stocks bank stocks money 
 and stores Each Rockefeller could say whether he wanted his limit in either the money oil or 
 bank stocks but about nine billion and eight hundred million would go to the Government 
 And so in this way the Government of the United States would come into the possession of 
 about two fifths of its wealth which on normal values would be worth say $ 165 billion 
  
  
 
                                                                0 
 Then we would turn to the inventories of the 25 million families of America All those who 
 showed properties and money clear of debts that were above $ 5,000 and up to the limit of a 
 few millions would not be touched But those showing less than $ 5,000 to the family free of 
 debt would be added to so that every family would start life again with homestead 
 possessions of at least a home and the comforts needed for a home including such things as 
 a radio and an automobile These things would go to every family as a homestead not to be 
 sold either for debts or taxes or   the owner   of the 
 court or Government and then only on condition that the court hold it to be spent for the 
 purpose of buying another home and comforts thereof 
 Such would mean that the $ 165 billion or more taken from big fortunes would have about 
 $ 100 billion of it used to provide all with the comforts of home and living The Government 
 might have to issue warrants for claim and location or even currency to be retired from such 
 property as was claimed but all that is a detail not impractical to get these homes into the 
 hands of the people 
 So America would start again with millionaires but no multi millionaires or billionaires with 
 some poor but none too poor to be denied the comforts of life America however would still 
 have maybe a $ 65 billion balance from these big fortunes not yet used to set up the poor 
 people What would we do with that Wait a moment I am coming to that too 
 Second We propose that after homes and comforts of homes have been set up for the 
 families of the country that we shall turn our attention to the children and the youth of the 
 land providing first for their education and training We would not have to worry about the 
 problem of child labor because the very first thing which we would place in front of every 
 child would be not only a comfortable home during his early years but the opportunity for 
 education and training not only through the grammar school and the high school but through 
 college and to include vocational and professional training for every child If necessary that 
 would include the living cost of that child while he attended college if one should be too 
 distant for him to live at home and conveniently attend as would be the case with many of 
 those living in the rural areas 
 We now have an educational system and in States like Louisiana and it is the best one 
 where school books are furnished free to every child and where   given 
 to every student however far he may live from a grammar or high school there is a fairly 
 good assurance of education through grammar and high school for the child whose father and 
 mother have enough at home to feed and clothe them But when it comes to a matter of 
 college education except in few cases the right to a college education is determined at this 
  
  
 
                                                                1 
 day and   ability of the father and mother to pay for the cost and the 
 expense of a college education It do n't make any difference how brilliant a boy or girl may 
 be that do n't give them the right to a college education in America today 
 Now Gen. Hugh Johnson says I am indeed a very smart demagogue a wise and dangerous 
 menace But I am one of those who did n't have the opportunity to secure a college education 
 or training We propose that the right to education and the extent of education shall be 
 determined and gauged not so   ability of the parents  
 ability and energy of a child to absorb the learning at a college This should appeal to General 
 Johnson who says I am a smart man since had I enjoyed the learning and college training 
 which my plan would provide for others I might not have fallen into the path of the 
 dangerous menace and demagogue that he has now found me to be 
 Remember we have $ 65 billion to account for that would lie in the hands of the United States 
 even after providing home comforts for all families We will use a large part of it immediately 
 to expand particularly the colleges and universities of this country You would not know the 
 great institutions like Yale Harvard and Louisiana State University Get ready for a surprise 
 College enrollments would multiply 1,000 percent We would immediately call in the architects 
 and engineers the idle professors and scholars of learning We would send out a hurry call 
 because the problem of providing college education for all of the youth would start a fusillade 
 of employment which might suddenly and immediately make it possible for us to shorten the 
 hours of labor even as we contemplate in the balance of our program 
 And how happy the youth of this land would be tomorrow morning if they knew instantly their 
 right to a home and the comforts of a home and to complete college and professional training 
 and education were assured I know how happy they would be because I know how I would 
 have felt had such a message been delivered to my door 
 I can not deliver that promise to the youth of this land tonight but I am doing my part I am 
 standing the blows I am hearing the charges hurled at me from the four quarters of the 
 country It is the same fight which was made against me in Louisiana when I was undertaking 
 to provide the free school books free busses university facilities and things of that kind to 
 educate the youth of that State as best I could It is the same blare which I heard when I was 
 undertaking to provide for the sick and the afflicted 
 When the youth of this land realizes what is meant and what is contemplated the billingsgate 
 and the profanity of all the Farleys and Johnsons in America ca n't prevent the light of truth 
 from hurling itself in understandable letters against the dark canopy of the sky 
  
  
 
                                                                2 
 Now when we have landed at the place where homes and comforts are provided for all 
 families and complete education and training for all young men and women the next problem 
 is what about our income to sustain our people thereafter How shall that be arranged to 
 guarantee all the fair share of what soul and body need to sustain them conveniently That 
 brings us to our next point We propose 
 Number 3 We shall shorten the hours of   much as may be necessary that none 
 will be worked too long and none unemployed We shall cut the hours of toil to 30 hours per 
 week maybe less we may cut the working year to 11 months work and 1 month 's vacation 
 maybe less If our great improvement programs show we need more labor than we may have 
 we will lengthen the hours as convenience requires At all events the hours for production will 
 be gauged to meet the market for consumption We will need all our machinery for many 
 years because we have much public improvement to do and further the more use that we 
 may make of them the less toil will be required for all of us to survive in splendor 
 Now a minimum earning would be established for any person with a family to support It 
 would be such a living which one already owning a home could maintain a family in comfort 
 of not less than $ 2,500 per year to every family 
 And   false statements made particularly by Mr. Arthur Brisbane and Gen. 
 Hugh S. Johnson I must make answer to show you that there is more than enough in this 
 country and more than enough raised and made every year to do what I propose 
 Mr. Brisbane says I am proposing to give every person $ 15,000 for a home and its comforts 
 and he says that would mean the United States would have to be worth over a trillion dollars 
 Why make that untrue statement Mr. Brisbane You know that is not so I do not propose any 
 home and comfort of $ 15,000 to each person it is a minimum of $ 5,000 to every family 
 which would be less than $ 125 billion which is less than one third of this Nation 's wealth in 
 normal times of $ 400 billion 
 General Johnson says that my proposal is for $ 5,000 guaranteed earning to each family 
 which he says would cost from four to five hundred millions of dollars per year which he says 
 is four times more than our whole national income ever has been Why make such untrue 
 statements General Johnson 
 Must you be a false witness to argue your point I do not propose $ 5,000 income per year to 
 each family I propose a minimum of from $ 2,000 to $ 2,500 income per year to each family 
 For 25 million families that minimum income per family would require from $ 50 billion to 
  
  
 
                                                                3 
 $ 60.6 billion In the prosperous days we have had nearly double that for income some years 
 already which allowed plenty for the affluent but with the unheard prosperity we would have 
 if all our people could buy what they need our national income would be double what it has 
 ever been 
 The Wall Street writer and statistician says we could have an income of at least $ 10,000 to 
 every family in goods if all worked short hours and none were idle According to him only 
 one fourth of the average income would carry out my plan 
 And now I come to the remainder of the plan We propose 
 Number 4 That agricultural production will be cared for in the manner specified in the Bible 
 We would plow under no crops we would burn no corn we would spill no milk into the river 
 we would shoot no hogs would slaughter no cattle to be rotted What we would do is this 
 We would raise all the cotton that we could raise all the corn that we could raise and 
 everything else that we could raise Let us say for example that we raised more cotton than 
 we could use 
 But here again I wish to surprise you when I say that if everyone could buy all the towels all 
 the sheets all the bedding all the clothing all the carpets all the window curtains and all of 
 everything else he reasonably needs America would consume 20 million bales of cotton per 
 year without having to sell a bale to the foreign countries The same would be true of the 
 wheat crop and of the corn crop and of the meat crop Whenever everyone could buy the 
 things he desires to eat there would be no great excess in any of those food supplies 
 But for the sake of the argument let us say however that there would be a surplus And I 
 hope there will be because it will do the country good to have a big surplus Let us take 
 cotton as an example Let us say that the United States will have a market for 10 million bales 
 of cotton and that we raise 15 million bales of cotton We will store 5 million bales in 
 warehouses   If the next year we raise 15 million bales of cotton 
 and only need 10 we will store another 5 million bales of cotton and the Government will 
 care for that When we reach the year when we have enough cotton to last for twelve or 
 eighteen months we will plant no more cotton for that next year The people will have their 
 certificates of the Government which they can cash in for that year for the surplus or if 
 necessary the Government can pay for the whole 15 million bales of cotton as it is produced 
 every year and when the year comes that we will raise no cotton we will not leave the 
 people idle and with nothing to do That is the year when in the cotton States we will do our 
  
  
 
                                                                4 
 public improvement work that needs to be done so badly We will care for the flood control 
 problems we will extend the electricity lines into rural areas we will widen roads and build 
 more roads and if we have a little time left some of us can go back and attend a school for a 
 few months and not only learn some of the things we have forgotten but we can learn some 
 things that they have found out about that they did n't know anything about when we were 
 children 
 
 Now the example of what we would do about cotton is the same policy we would follow about 
 all other crops This program would necessitate the building of large storage plants both 
 heated and cold storage and warehouses in all the counties of America and that building 
 program alone would take up all the idle people that America has today But the money spent 
 would go for good and would prevent any trouble happening in the future And then there is 
 another good thing If we would fill these warehouses then if there were to come a year of 
 famine there would be enough on hand to feed and clothe the people of the Nation It would 
 be the part of good sense to keep a year or two of stock on hand all the time to provide for an 
 emergency maybe to provide for war or other calamity 
 I give you the next step in our program 
 Number 5 We will provide for old age pensions for those who reach the age of 60 and pay it 
 to all those who have an income of less than $ 1,000 per year or less than $ 10,000 in property 
 or money This would relieve from the ranks of labor those persons who press down the price 
 for the use of their flesh and blood Now the person who reaches the age of 60 would already 
 have the comforts of home as well as something else   the 
 redistribution that had been made of things They would be given enough more to give them a 
 reasonably comfortable existence in their declining days However such would not come from 
 a sales tax or taxes placed upon the common run of people It would be supported from the 
 taxes levied on those with big incomes and the yearly tax that would be levied on big 
 fortunes so that they would always be kept down to a few million dollars to any one person 
 Number 6 We propose that the obligations which this country owes to the veterans of its 
 wars including the soldiers bonus and to care for those who have been either incapacitated 
 or disabled would be discharged without stint or unreasonable limit I have always supported 
 each and every bill that has had to do with the payment of the bonus due to the ex service 
 men I have always opposed reducing the allowances which they have been granted It is an 
  
  
 
                                                                5 
 unfair thing for a country to begin its economy while big fortunes   on 
 those who have borne the burden of national defense 
 Now ladies and gentlemen such is the share our wealth movement What I have here stated

 of Leviticus from the twenty fifth to the twenty seventh chapters You will find it in the

36,Franklin D. Roosevelt,First Fireside Chat,1933," 
 
 
 My friends 
 I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking to talk 
 with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking but more particularly 
 with the overwhelming majority of you who use banks for the making of deposits and the 
 drawing of checks 
 I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days and why it was done and what the 
 next steps are going to be I recognize that the many proclamations from State capitols and 
 from Washington the legislation the Treasury regulations and so forth couched for the most 
 part in banking and legal terms ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen I 
 owe this in particular because of the fortitude and the good temper with which everybody 
 has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the banking holiday And I know that when 
 you understand what we in Washington have been about I shall continue to have your 
 cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and your help during the past week 
  
  
 
                                  
 First of all let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank the bank does 
 not put the money into a safe deposit vault It invests your money in many different forms of 
 credit in bonds in commercial paper in mortgages and in many other kinds of loans In 
 other words the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of 
 agriculture turning around A comparatively small part of the money that you put into the 
 bank is kept in currency an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the 
 cash needs of the average citizen In other words the total amount of all the currency in the 
 country is only a comparatively small proportion of the total deposits in all the banks of the 
 country 
 What then happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March 
 Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public there was a general rush by a 
 large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold a rush so great 
 that the soundest banks could n't get enough currency to meet the demand The reason for 
 this was that on the spur of the moment it was of course impossible to sell perfectly sound 
 assets of a bank and convert them into cash except at panic prices far below their real value 
 By the afternoon of March third a week ago last Friday scarcely a bank in the country was 
 open to do business Proclamations closing them in whole or in part had been issued by the 
 Governors in almost all the states It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the 
 national bank holiday and this was the first step in the Government ’s reconstruction of our 
 financial and economic fabric 
 The second step last Thursday was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the 
 Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possible 
 in view of the requirement of time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday 
 gradually in the days to come This law also gave authority to develop a program of 
 rehabilitation of our banking facilities And I want to tell our citizens in every part of the 
 Nation that the national Congress Republicans and Democrats alike  
 a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed 
 that it is difficult to match in all our history 
 The third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the banks to continue their 
 functions to take care of the distribution of food and household necessities and the payment of 
 payrolls 
  
  
 
                                  
 This bank holiday while resulting in many cases in great inconvenience is affording us the 
 opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation Remember that no sound 
 bank is a dollar worse off than it was when it closed its doors last week Neither is any bank 
 which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening The new law allows the 
 twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks 
 that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call The new currency is being sent out by 
 the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in large volume to every part of the country It is sound 
 currency because it is  assets 
 Another question you will ask is this Why are all the banks not to be reopened at the same 
 time The answer is simple and I know you will understand it Your Government does not 
 intend that the history of the past few years shall be repeated We do not want and will not 
 have another epidemic of bank failures 
 As a result we start tomorrow Monday with the opening of banks in the twelve Federal 
 Reserve Bank cities those banks which on first have already 
 been found to be all right That will be followed on   of all other 
  found to be sound in cities where there are recognized clearing 
 houses That means about two hundred and fifty cities of the United States In other words 
 we are moving as fast as the mechanics of the situation will allow us 
 On Wednesday and succeeding days banks in smaller places all through the country will 
 resume business subject of course to the Government 's physical ability to complete its 
 survey It is necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in order to 
 permit the banks to make applications for the necessary loans to obtain currency needed to 
 meet their requirements and to enable the Government to make common sense checkups 
 Please let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the first day you are by no 
 means justified in believing that it will not open A bank that opens on one of the subsequent 
 days is in exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow 
 I know that many people are worrying about State banks that are not members of the Federal 
 Reserve System There is no occasion for that worry These banks can and will receive 
 assistance from member banks and from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation And of 
 course they are under the immediate control of the State banking authorities These State 
  
  
 
                                  
 banks are following the same course as the National banks except that they get their licenses 
 to resume business from the State authorities and these authorities have been asked by the 
 Secretary of the Treasury to permit their good banks to open up on the same schedule as the 
 national banks And so I am confident that the State Banking Departments will be as careful 
 as the national Government in the policy relating to the opening of banks and will follow the 
 same broad theory 
 It is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who have not recovered from 
 their fear may again begin withdrawals Let me make it clear to you that the banks will take 
 care of all needs except of course the hysterical demands of hoarders and it is my belief 
 that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime in 
 every part of our nation It needs no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they 
 can get their money that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes the 
 phantom of fear will soon be laid People will again be glad to have their money where it will 
 be safely taken care of and where they can use it conveniently at any time I can assure you 
 my friends that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than it is to keep it under 
 the mattress 
 The success of our whole national program depends of course on the cooperation of the 
 public on its intelligent support and its use of a reliable system 
 Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible 
 for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the case before More liberal 
 provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the Reserve Banks and more 
 liberal provision has also been made for issuing currency on the security of these good assets 
 This currency is not fiat currency It is issued only on adequate security and every good bank 
 has an abundance of such security 
 One more point before I close There will be of course some banks unable to reopen without 
 being reorganized The new law allows the Government to assist in making these 
 reorganizations quickly and effectively and even allows the Government to subscribe to at 
 least a part of any new capital that may be required 
 I hope you can see my friends from this essential recital of what your Government is doing 
 that there is nothing complex nothing radical in the process 
  
  
 
                                  
 We have had a bad banking situation Some of our bankers had shown themselves either 
 incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the people ’s funds They had used the money 
 entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans This was of course not true in the vast 
 majority of our banks but it was true in enough of them to shock the people of the United 
 States for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put them into a frame of mind where they 
 did not differentiate but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted 
 them all And so it became the Government ’s job to straighten out this situation and do it as 
 quickly as possible And that job is being performed 
 I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that individual losses will not be 
 suffered but there will be no losses that possibly could be avoided and there would have 
 been more and greater losses had we continued to drift I can even promise you salvation for 
 some at least of the sorely presses banks We shall be engaged not merely in reopening 
 sound banks but in the creation of more sound banks through reorganization 
 It has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confidence from all over the country I can 
 never be sufficiently grateful to the people for the loyal support that they have given me in 
 their acceptance of the judgment that has dictated our course even though all our processes 
 may not have seemed clear to them 
 After all there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than 
 currency more important than gold and that is the confidence of the people themselves 
 Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan You people 
 must have faith you must not be   guesses Let us unite in banishing 
 fear We have provided the machinery to restore our financial system and it is up to you to 
 support and make it work 
 It is your problem my friends your problem no less than it is mine 
 Together we can not fail",0.041650291532278,0.0268461760133504,0.1171887218952179,0.0398805253207683,0.7321599721908569,0.0256115011870861,0.0166627205908298,0.115255391929499,0.5143770292207791,46.64551992528021,0.3129770992366412,0.00816326530612245,0.07736720554272518,0.06332842415316642,29.7972972972973,1.0
37,Edward M. Kennedy,Eulogy for Robert Kennedy,1968," 
 
 
 Your Eminences Your Excellencies Mr. President  
 On behalf of Mrs. Kennedy her children the parents and sisters of Robert Kennedy I want to 
 express what we feel to those who mourn with us today in this Cathedral and around the 
 world  
 We loved him as a brother and as a father and as a son From his parents and from his 
 older brothers and sisters Joe and Kathleen and Jack he received an inspiration which he 
 passed on to all of us He gave us strength in time of trouble wisdom in time of uncertainty 
 and sharing in time of happiness He will always   
 Love is not an easy feeling to put into words Nor is loyalty or trust or joy But he was all of 
 these He loved life completely and he lived it intensely  
 A few years back Robert Kennedy wrote some words about his own father which expresses 
 sic the way we in his family felt about him He said of what his father meant to him and I 
 quote 
 What it really all adds up to is love not love as it is described with such facility in 
 popular magazines but the kind of love that is affection and respect order and 
  
  
 
                  
       
       
        
        
 encouragement and support Our awareness of this was an incalculable source of 
 strength and because real love is something unselfish and involves sacrifice and 
 giving we could not help but profit from it 
 And he continued 
 Beneath it all he has tried to engender a social conscience There were wrongs which 
 needed attention There were people who were poor and needed help And we have a 
 responsibility to them and to this country Through no virtues and accomplishments of 
 our own we have been fortunate enough to be born in the United States under the 
 most comfortable conditions We therefore have a responsibility to others who are 
 less well off 
 That is what Robert Kennedy was given What he leaves to us is what he said what he did 
 and what he stood for A speech he made to the young people of South Africa on their Day of 
 Affirmation in 1966 sums it up the best and I would like to read it now  
 There is discrimination in this world and slavery and slaughter and starvation 
 Governments repress their people millions are trapped in poverty while the nation 
 grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere These are differing evils 
 but they are the common works of man They reflect the imperfection of human 
 justice the inadequacy of human compassion our lack of sensibility towards the 
 suffering of our fellows But we can perhaps remember even if only for a time that 
 those who live with us are our brothers that they share with us the same short 
 moment of life that they seek as we do nothing but the chance to live out their 
 lives in purpose and happiness winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can  
 Surely this bond of common faith this bond of common goal can begin to teach us 
 something Surely we can learn at least to look at those around us as fellow men 
 And surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to 
 become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again The answer is to rely 
 on youth not a time of life but a state of mind a temper of the will a quality of 
 imagination a predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite for adventure 
 over the love of ease The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will 
 not yield to the obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans They can not be moved by those 
 who cling to a present that is already dying who prefer the illusion of security to the 
 excitement and danger that come with even the most peaceful progress 
  
  
 
                  
       
       
        
        
 It is a revolutionary world we live in and this generation at home and around the world 
 has had thrust upon it a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has 
 ever lived Some believe there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the 
 enormous array of the world 's ills Yet many of the world 's great movements of 
 thought and action have flowed from the work of a single man A young monk began 
 the Protestant reformation a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to 
 the borders of the earth a young woman reclaimed the territory of France and it was 
 a young Italian explorer who discovered the New World and the 32 year old Thomas 
 Jefferson who pro]claimed that all men are created equal 
 These men moved the world and so can we all Few will have the greatness to bend 
 history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the 
 total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation Each time a man 
 stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against 
 injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million 
 different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current that can sweep 
 down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance 
 Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows the censure of their 
 colleagues the wrath of their society Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery 
 in battle or great intelligence Yet it is the one essential vital quality for those who 
 seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change And I believe that in this 
 generation those with the courage to enter the moral conflict will find themselves with 
 companions in every corner of the globe 
 For the fortunate among us there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar 
 paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who 
 enjoy the privilege of education But that is not the road history has marked out for us 
 Like it or not we live in times of danger and uncertainty But they are also more open 
 to the creative energy of men than any other time in history All of us will ultimately be 
 judged and as the years pass we will surely judge ourselves on the effort we have 
 contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which our ideals and 
 goals have shaped that event 
 Our future may lie beyond our vision but it is not completely beyond our control It is 
 the shaping impulse of America that neither fate nor nature nor the irresistible tides of 
 history but the work of our own hands matched to reason and principle that will 
  
  
 
                  
       
       
        
        
 determine our destiny There is pride in that even arrogance but there is also 
 experience and truth In any event it is the only way we can live 
 That is the way he lived That is what he leaves us 
 My brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life to be 
 remembered simply as a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it saw 
 suffering and tried to heal it saw war and tried to stop it 
 Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today pray that what he was to us 
 and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world 
 As he said many times in many parts of this nation to those he touched and who sought to 
 touch him

 I dream things that never were and say why not",0.0019197522196918,0.0036742812953889,0.0087976278737187,0.0056595117785036,0.0198852773755788,0.9569523334503174,0.0031112120486795,0.2204652552308802,0.5200310395622894,64.4900606796117,0.4237726098191214,0.008387096774193548,0.14309484193011648,0.08452722063037249,27.19298245614035,1.0
38,Clarence Darrow,A Plea for Mercy,1924," 
 
 Now your Honor I have spoken about the war I believed in it I do n’t know whether I was 
 crazy or not Sometimes I think perhaps I was I approved of it I joined in the general cry of 
 madness and despair I urged men to fight I was safe because I was too old to go I was like 
 the rest What did they do Right or wrong justifiable or unjustifiable which I need not 
 discuss today it changed the world For four long years the civilized world was engaged in 
 killing men Christian against Christian barbarian uniting with Christians to kill Christians 
 anything to kill It was taught in every school aye in the Sunday schools The little children 
 played at war The toddling children on the street Do you suppose this world has ever been 
 the same since How long your Honor will it take for the world to get back the humane 
 emotions that were slowly growing before the war How long will it take the calloused hearts 
 of men before the scars of hatred and cruelty shall be removed 
 We read of killing one hundred thousand men in a day We read about it and we rejoiced in it 
 if it was the other fellows who were killed We were fed on flesh and drank blood Even 
 down to the prattling babe I need not tell you how many upright honorable young boys have 
 come into this court charged with murder some saved and some sent to their death boys 
  
  
 
               
       
 who fought in this war and learned to place a cheap value on human life You know it and I 
 know it These boys were brought up in it The tales of death were in their homes their 
 playgrounds their schools they were in the newspapers that they read it was a part of the 
 common frenzy what was a life It was nothing It was the least sacred thing in existence 
 and these boys were trained to this cruelty 
 It will take fifty years to wipe it out of the human heart if ever I know this that after the 
 Civil War in 1865 crimes of this sort increased marvelously No one needs to tell me that 
 crime has no cause It has as definite a cause as any other disease and I know that out of the 
 hatred and bitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before I 
 know that Europe is going through the same experience today I know it has followed every 
 war and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would 
 have been if the world had not made red with blood I protest against the crimes and mistakes 
 of society being visited upon them All of us have a share in it I have mine I can not tell and I 
 shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love 
 and kindness and charity 
 Your Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the 
 war Not   fought   learned that blood was cheap and 
 human life was cheap and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy There are causes 
 for this terrible crime There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the 
 world War is a part of it education is a part of it birth is a part of it money is a part of it 
 all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys 
 Has the court any right to consider anything but these two boys The State says that your 
 Honor has a right to consider the welfare of the community as you have If the welfare of the 
 community would be   lives well and good I think it would work evil 
 that no one could measure Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these 
 defendants I have been sorry and I am sorry for the bereavement of Mr. And Mrs. Frank for 
 those broken ties that can not be healed All I can hope and wish is that some good may come 
 from it all But as compared with the families of Leopold and Loeb the Franks are to be envied 
 and everyone knows it 
 I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys I hate to say it in their presence 
 but what is there to look forward to I do not know but what your Honor would be merciful to 
 them but not merciful to civilization and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks 
 and let them die merciful to them but not merciful to civilization and not merciful to those 
 who would be left behind To spend the balance of their days in prison is mighty little to look 
  
  
 
               
       
 forward to if anything Is it anything They may have the hope that as the years roll around 
 they might be released I do not know I do not know I will be honest with this court as I 
 have tried to be from the beginning I know that these boys are not fit to be at large I believe 
 they will not be until they pass through the next stage of life at forty five or fifty Whether 
 they will then I can not tell I am sure of this that I will not be here to help them So far as I 
 am concerned it is over 
 I would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time when life and age have changed 
 their bodies as they do and have changed their emotions as they do that they may once 
 more return to life I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any 
 human being that lives and least of all to my clients But what have they to look forward to 
 Nothing 
 And I think here of the stanza of Housman 
 Now hollow fires burn out to black 
 And lights are fluttering low 
 Square your shoulders lift your pack 
 And leave your friends and go 
 O never fear lads naught ’s to dread 
 Look not left nor right 
 In all the endless road you tread 
 There ’s nothing but the night 
 I care not your Honor whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joilet 
 close upon them there is nothing but the night and that is little for any human being to 
 expect 
 But there are others to consider Here are these two families who have led honest lives who 
 will bear the name that they bear and future generations must carry it on 
 Here it Leopold ’s father and this boy was the pride of his life He watched him he cared for 
 him he worked for him the boy was brilliant and accomplished he educated him and he 
 thought that fame and position awaited him as it should have awaited It is a hard thing for a 
 father to see his life ’s hopes crumble into dust 
  
  
 
               
       
 Should he be considered Should his brothers be considered Will it do society any good or 
 make your life safer or any human being ’s life safer if it should be handled down from 
 generation to generation that this boy their kin died upon the scaffold 
 And Loeb ’s the same Here are the faithful uncle and brother who have watched here day by 
 day while Dickie ’s father and his mother are too ill to stand this terrific strain and shall be 
 waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me Shall these 
 be taken into account in this general bereavement 
 Have they any rights Is there any reason your Honor why their proud names and all the 
 future generations that bear them shall have this bar sinister written across them How many 
 boys and girls how many unborn children will feel it It is bad enough as it is God knows 
 It is bad enough however it is But it ’s not yet death on the scaffold It ’s not that And I ask 
 your Honor in addition to all that I have said to save two honorable families from a disgrace 
 that never ends and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives 
 Now I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it 
 long ago None of us are unmindful of the public courts are not and juries are not We placed 
 our fate in the hands of a trained court thinking that he would be more mindful and 
 considerate than a jury I can not say how people feel I have stood here for three months as 
 one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide I hope the seas are subsiding and 
 the wind is falling and I believe they are but I wish to make no false pretense to this court 
 The easy thing and the popular thing to do is to hang my clients I know it Men and women 
 who do not think will applaud The cruel and thoughtless will approve It will be easy today 
 but in Chicago and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land more and more 
 fathers and mothers the humane the kind and the hopeful who are gaining an 
 understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys but about their own 
 these will join in no acclaim at the death of my clients 
 These would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped and that the normal feelings of man 
 resume their sway And as the days and the months and the years go on they will ask it more 
 and more But your Honor what they shall ask may not count I know the easy way I know 
 the future is with me and what I stand for here not merely for the lives of these two 
 unfortunate lads but for all boys and all girls for all of the young and as far as possible for 
 all of the old I am pleading for life understanding charity kindness and the infinite mercy 
 that considers all I am pleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love 
 I know the future is on my side Your Honor stands between the past and the future You may 
  
  
 
               
       
 hang these boys you may hang   until they are dead But in doing it you will 
 turn your face toward the past In doing it you are making it harder for every other boy who 
 in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood 
 knows In doing it you will make it harder for unborn children You may save them and make 
 it easier for every child that sometime may stand where these boys stand You will make it 
 easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate I am 
 pleading for the future I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the 
 hearts of men When we can   judgment and understanding and faith that 
 all life is worth saving and that mercy is the highest attribute of man 
 I feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken This case may not be as 
 important as I think it is and I am sure I do not need to tell this court or to tell my friends 
 that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich If I should succeed my greatest 
 reward and my greatest hope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the 
 same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod that I have done something to 
 help human understanding to temper justice with mercy to overcome hate with love 
 I was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet Omar Khayyam It appealed 
 to me as the highest that I can vision I wish it was in my heart and I wish it was in the 
 hearts of all

39,Carrie Chapman Catt,Address to Congress on Women ’s Suffrage,1917," 
 
 Woman suffrage is inevitable Suffragists knew it before November 4 1917 opponents 
 afterward Three distinct causes made it inevitable 
 First the history of our country Ours is a nation born of revolution of rebellion against a 
 system of government so securely entrenched in the customs and traditions of human society 
 that in 1776 it seemed impregnable From the beginning of things nations had been ruled by 
 kings and for kings while the people served and paid the cost The American Revolutionists 
 boldly proclaimed the heresies Taxation without representation is tyranny Governments 
 derive their just powers from the consent of the governed The colonists won and the nation 
 which was established as a result of their victory has held unfailingly that these two 
 fundamental principles of democratic government are not only the spiritual source of our 
 national existence but have been our chief historic pride and at all times the sheet anchor of 
 our liberties 
 Eighty years after the Revolution Abraham Lincoln welded those two maxims into a new one 
 Ours is a government of the  and for the people Fifty years more 
 passed and the president of the United States Woodrow Wilson in a mighty crisis of the 
 nation proclaimed to the world We are fighting for the things which we have always carried 
 nearest to our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a 
 voice in their own government 
  
  
 
                             
     
     
           
      
      
             
 All the way between these immortal aphorisms political leaders have declared unabated faith 
 in their truth Not one American has arisen to question their logic in the 141 years of our 
 national existence However stupidly our country may have evaded the logical application at 
 times it has never swerved from its devotion to the theory of democracy as expressed by 
 those two axioms 
 With such a history behind it how can our nation escape the logic it has never failed to follow 
 when its last un enfranchised class calls for the vote Behold our Uncle Sam floating the 
 banner with one hand Taxation without representation is tyranny and with the other 
 seizing the billions of dollars paid in   whom he refuses representation 
 Behold him again welcoming the boys of twenty one and the newly made immigrant citizen to 
 a voice in their own government while he denies that fundamental right of democracy to 
 thousands of women public school teachers from whom many of these men learn all they 
 know of citizenship and patriotism to women college presidents to women who preach in our 
 pulpits interpret law in our courts preside over our hospitals write books and magazines 
 and serve in every uplifting moral and social enterprise Is there a single man who can justify 
 such inequality of treatment such outrageous discrimination Not one 
 Second the suffrage for women already established in the United States makes women 
 suffrage for the nation inevitable When Elihu Root as president of the American Society of 
 International Law at the eleventh annual meeting in Washington April 26 1917 said The 
 world can not be half democratic and half autocratic It must be all democratic or all Prussian 
 There can be no compromise he voiced a general truth Precisely the same intuition has 
 already taught the blindest and most hostile foe of woman suffrage that our nation can not 
 long continue a condition under which government in half its territory rests upon the consent 
 of half of the people and in the other half upon the consent of all the people a condition which 
 grants representation to the taxed in half of its territory and denies it in the other half a 
 condition which permits women in some states to share in the election of the president 
 senators and representatives and denies them that privilege in others It is too obvious to 
 require demonstration that woman suffrage now covering half our territory will eventually be 
 ordained in all the nation No one will deny it The only question left is when and how will it be 
 completely established 
 Third the leadership of the United States in world democracy compels the enfranchisement of 
 its own women The maxims of the Declaration were once called fundamental principles of 
 government They are now called American principles or even Americanisms They have 
 become the slogans of every movement toward political liberty the world around of every 
 effort to widen the suffrage for men or women in any land Not a people race or class 
  
  
 
                             
     
     
           
      
      
             
 striving for freedom is there anywhere in the world that has not made our axioms the chief 
 weapon of the struggle More all men and women the world around with farsighted vision 
 into the verities of things know that the world tragedy of our day is not now being waged 
 over the assassination of an archduke nor commercial competition nor national ambitions 
 nor the freedom of the seas It is a death grapple between the forces which deny and those 
 which uphold the truths of the Declaration of Independence 
 Do you realize that in no other country in the world with democratic tendencies is suffrage so 
 completely denied as in a considerable number of our own states There are thirteen black 
 states where no suffrage for women exists and fourteen others where suffrage for women is 
 more limited than in many foreign countries 
 Do you realize that when you ask women to take their cause to state referendum you compel 
 them to do this that you drive women of education refinement achievement to beg men 
 who can not read for their political freedom 
 Do you realize that such anomalies as a college president asking her janitor to give her a vote 
 are overstraining the patience and driving women to desperation 
 Do you realize that women in increasing numbers indignantly resent the long delay in their 
 enfranchisement 
 Your party platforms have pledged women suffrage Then why not be honest frank friends of 
 our cause adopt it in reality as your own make it a party program and fight with us As a 
 party measure a measure of all parties why not put the amendment through Congress 
 and the legislatures We shall all be better friends we shall have a happier nation we women 
 will be free to support loyally the party of our choice and we shall be far prouder of our 
 history 
 There is one thing mightier than kings and armies aye than Congresses and political 
 parties the power of an idea when its time has come to move The time for woman 
 suffrage has come The woman 's hour has struck If parties prefer to postpone action longer 
 and thus do battle with this idea they challenge the inevitable The idea will not perish the 
 party which opposes it may Every delay every trick every political dishonesty from now on 
 will antagonize the women of the land more and more and when the party or parties which 
 have so delayed woman suffrage finally let it come their sincerity will be doubted and their 
 appeal to the new voters will be met with suspicion This is the psychology of the situation 
 Can you afford the risk Think it over 
  
  
 
                             
     
     
           
      
      
             
 We know you will meet opposition There are a few women haters left a few old males of 
 the tribe as Vance Thompson calls them whose duty they believe it to be to keep women in 
 the places they have carefully picked out for them Treitschke made world famous by war 
 literature said some years ago Germany which knows all about Germany and France 
 knows far better what is good for Alsace Lorraine than that miserable people can possibly 
 know A few American Treitschkes we have who know better than women what is good for 
 them There are women too with slave souls and clinging vines for backbones There are 
 female dolls and male dandies But the world does not wait for such as these nor does liberty 
 pause to heed the plaint of men and women with a grouch She does not wait for those who 
 have a special interest to serve nor a selfish reason for depriving other people of freedom 
 Holding her torch aloft liberty is pointing the way onward and upward and saying to America 
 Come 
 To you and the supporters of our cause in Senate and House and the number is large the 
 suffragists of the nation express their grateful thanks This address is not meant for you We 
 are more truly appreciative of all you have done than any words can express We ask you to 
 make a last hard fight for the amendment during the present session Since last we asked a 
 vote on this amendment your position has been   to suffrage territory 
 of Great Britain Canada and New York 
 Some of you have been too indifferent to give more than casual attention to this question It 
 is worthy of your immediate consideration A question big enough to engage the attention of 
 our allies in wartime is too big a question for you to neglect 
 Some of you have grown old in party service Are you willing that those who take your places 
 by   you for having failed to keep pace with the world and thus having lost 
 for them a party advantage Is there any real gain for you for your party for your nation by 
 delay Do you want to drive the progressive men and women out of your party 
 Some of you hold to the doctrine of states rights as applying to woman suffrage Adherence 
 to that theory will keep the United States far behind all other democratic nations upon this 
 question A theory which prevents a nation from keeping up with the trend of world progress 
 can not be justified 
 Gentlemen we hereby petition you our only designated representatives to redress our 
  passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and to use your 
 influence to secure its ratification in your own state in order that the women of our nation 
  
  
 
                             
     
     
           
      
      
             
 may be endowed with political freedom before the next presidential election and that our 
 nation may resume its world leadership in democracy

40,Harry S. Truman,The Truman Doctrine,1947," 
 
 
 Mr. President Mr. Speaker Members of the Congress of the United States  
 The gravity of the situation which confronts the world today necessitates my appearance 
 before a joint session of the Congress The foreign policy and the national security of this 
 country are involved One aspect of the present situation which I present to you at this time 
 for your consideration and decision concerns Greece and Turkey The United States has 
 received from the Greek Government an urgent appeal for financial and economic assistance 
 Preliminary reports from the American Economic Mission now in Greece and reports from the 
 American Ambassador in Greece corroborate the statement of the Greek Government that 
 assistance is imperative if Greece is to survive as a free nation  
 I do not believe that the American people and the Congress wish to turn a deaf ear to the 
 appeal of the Greek Government Greece is not a rich country Lack of   sufficient natural 
 resources has always forced the Greek people to work hard to make both ends meet Since 
 1940 this industrious peace loving country has suffered invasion four years of cruel enemy 
 occupation and bitter internal strife  
  
  
 
                                     
 When forces of liberation entered Greece they found that the retreating Germans had 
 destroyed virtually all the railways roads port facilities communications and merchant 
 marine More than a thousand villages had been burned Eighty five percent of the children 
 were tubercular Livestock poultry and draft animals had almost disappeared Inflation had 
 wiped out practically all savings As a result of these tragic conditions a militant minority 
 exploiting human want and misery was able to create political chaos which until now has 
 made economic recovery impossible  
 Greece is today without funds to finance the importation of those goods which are essential to 
 bare subsistence Under these circumstances the people of Greece can not make progress in 
 solving their problems of reconstruction Greece is in desperate need of financial and 
 economic assistance to enable it to resume purchases of food clothing fuel and seeds These 
 are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and are obtainable only from abroad 
 Greece must have help to import the goods necessary to restore internal order and security 
 so essential for economic and political recovery The Greek Government has also asked for the 
 assistance of experienced American administrators economists and technicians to insure that 
 the financial and other aid given to Greece shall be used effectively in creating a stable and 
 self sustaining economy and in improving its public administration  
 The very existence of the Greek state is today   activities of several 
 thousand armed men  defy the government 's authority at a number 
 of points particularly along the northern boundaries A Commission  
 Nations security Council is at present investigating disturbed conditions in northern Greece 
 and alleged border violations along the frontiers between Greece on the one hand and 
 Albania Bulgaria and Yugoslavia on the other  
 Meanwhile the Greek Government is unable to cope with the situation The Greek army is 
 small and poorly equipped It needs supplies and equipment if it is to restore authority of the 
 government throughout Greek territory Greece must have assistance if it is to become a self- 
 supporting and self respecting democracy The United States must supply this assistance We 
 have already extended to Greece certain types of relief and economic aid But these are 
 inadequate There is no other country to which democratic Greece can turn No other nation is 
 willing and able to provide the necessary support for a democratic Greek government  
 The British Government which has been helping Greece can give no further financial or 
 economic aid after March 31st Great Britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or 
 liquidating its commitments in several parts of the world including Greece  
  
  
 
                                     
 We have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis But the situation is an 
 urgent one requiring immediate action and the United Nations and its related organizations 
 are not in a position to extend help of the kind that is required  
 It is important to note that the Greek Government has asked for our aid in utilizing effectively 
 the financial and other assistance we may give to Greece and in improving its public 
 administration It is of the utmost importance that we supervise the use of any funds made 
 available to Greece in such a manner that each dollar spent will count toward making Greece 
 self supporting and will help to build an economy in which a healthy democracy can flourish  
 No government is perfect One of the chief virtues of a democracy however is that its defects 
 are always visible and under democratic processes can be pointed out and corrected The 
 Government of Greece is not perfect Nevertheless it represents eighty five percent of the 
 members of the Greek Parliament who were chosen in an election last year Foreign 
 observers including 692 Americans considered this election to be a fair expression of the 
 views of the Greek people  
 The Greek Government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos and extremism It has 
 made mistakes The extension of   does not mean that the United States 
 condones everything that the Greek Government has done or will do We have condemned in 
 the past and we condemn now extremist measures of the right or the left We have in the 
 past advised tolerance and we advise tolerance now  
 Greek 's sic neighbor Turkey also deserves our attention The future of Turkey as an 
 independent and economically sound state is clearly no less important to the freedom loving 
 peoples of the world than the future of Greece The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself 
 today are considerably different from those of Greece Turkey has been spared the disasters 
 that have beset Greece And during the war the United States and Great Britain furnished 
 Turkey with material aid  
 Nevertheless Turkey now needs our support Since the war Turkey has sought additional 
 financial assistance from Great Britain and the United States for the purpose of effecting that 
 modernization necessary for the maintenance of its national integrity That integrity is 
 essential to the preservation of order in the Middle East The British government has informed 
 us that owing to its own difficulties it can no longer extend financial or economic aid to 
 Turkey As in the case of Greece if Turkey is to have the assistance it needs the United 
 States must supply it We are the only country able to provide that help  
  
  
 
                                     
 I am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United States extends assistance to 
 Greece and Turkey and I shall discuss these implications with you at this time One of the 
 primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States is the creation of conditions in 
 which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion This was 
 a fundamental issue in the war with Germany and Japan Our victory was won over countries 
 which sought to impose their will and their way of life upon other nations  
 To ensure the peaceful development of nations free from coercion the United States has 
 taken a leading part in establishing the United Nations The United Nations is designed to 
 make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members We shall not realize our 
 objectives however unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free 
 institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose 
 upon them totalitarian regimes This is no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian 
 regimes imposed upon free  indirect aggression undermine the 
 foundations of international peace and hence the security of the United States  
 The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes 
 forced upon them against their will The Government of the United States has made frequent 
 protests against coercion and intimidation in violation of the Yalta agreement in Poland 
 Rumania and Bulgaria I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been 
 similar developments  
 At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative 
 ways of life The choice is too often not a free one One way of life is based upon the will of 
 the majority and is representative government free 
 elections guarantees of individual liberty freedom of speech and religion and freedom from 
 political oppression The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly 
 imposed upon the majority It relies upon terror and oppression a controlled press and radio 
 fixed elections and the suppression of personal freedoms  
 I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are 
 resisting attempted    
 I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way  
 I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is 
 essential to economic stability and orderly political processes  
  
  
 
                                     
 The world is not static and the status quo is not sacred But we can not allow changes in the 
 status quo in violation of the Charter of the United   as coercion or by 
 such subterfuges as political infiltration In helping free and independent nations to maintain 
 their freedom the United States will be giving effect to the principles of the Charter of the 
 United Nations  
 It is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival and integrity of the Greek 
 nation are of grave importance in a much wider situation If Greece should fall under the 
 control of an armed minority the effect upon its neighbor Turkey would be immediate and 
 serious Confusion and disorder might well spread throughout the entire Middle East 
 Moreover the disappearance of Greece as an independent state would have a profound effect 
 upon those countries in Europe whose peoples are struggling against great difficulties to 
 maintain their freedoms and their independence while they repair the damages of war  
 It would be an unspeakable tragedy if these countries which have struggled so long against 
 overwhelming odds should lose that victory for which they sacrificed so much Collapse of 
 free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for them but for the 
 world Discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples 
 striving to maintain their freedom and independence  
 Should we fail to aid Greece and Turkey in this fateful hour the effect will be far reaching to 
 the West as well as to the East  
 We must take immediate and resolute action I therefore ask the Congress to provide 
 authority for assistance to Greece and Turkey in the amount of $ 400,000,000 for the period 
 ending June 30 1948 In requesting these funds I have taken into consideration the 
 maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnished to Greece out of the 
 $ 350,000,000 which I recently requested that the Congress authorize for the prevention of 
 starvation and suffering in countries   
 In addition to funds I ask the Congress to authorize the detail of American civilian and 
 military personnel to Greece and Turkey at the request of those countries to assist in the 
 tasks of reconstruction and for the purpose of supervising the use of such financial and 
 material assistance as may be furnished I recommend that authority also be provided for the 
 instruction and training of selected Greek and Turkish personnel Finally I ask that the 
 Congress provide authority which will permit the speediest and most effective use in terms of 
 needed commodities supplies and equipment of such funds as may be authorized 
  
  
 
                                     
 If further funds or further authority should be needed for the purposes indicated in this 
 message I shall not hesitate to bring the situation before the Congress On this subject the 
 Executive and Legislative branches of the Government must work together  
 This is a serious course upon which we embark I would not recommend it except that the 
 alternative is much more serious The United States contributed $ 341,000,000,000 toward 
 winning World War II This is an investment in world freedom and world peace The assistance 
 that I am recommending for Greece and Turkey amounts to little more than 1 tenth of 1 
 percent of this investment It is only common sense that we should safeguard this investment 
 and make sure that it was not in vain The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by 
 misery and want They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife They reach their 
 full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died  
 We must keep that hope alive  
 The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms If we falter 
 in our leadership we may endanger the peace of the world And we shall surely endanger the 
 welfare of this nation  
 Great responsibilities have been placed upon   
 I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely",0.108898639678955,0.038454420864582,0.5775706768035889,0.0106087075546383,0.0335108786821365,0.2246239185333252,0.0063328314572572,0.1125226449275362,0.396385438233264,40.09596806843413,0.2874125874125874,0.016810007818608287,0.06354515050167224,0.0504704875962361,23.254545454545454,1.0
41,Hubert Humphrey,1948 Democratic National Convention Address,1948," 
 
 
 Mr. Chairman fellow Democrats fellow Americans  
 I realize that in speaking in behalf of the minority report on civil rights as presented by 
 Congressman DeMiller of Wisconsin that I 'm dealing with a charged issue with an issue 
 which has been   all sides of the fence I realize that there are 
 here today friends and colleagues of mine many of them who feel just as deeply and keenly 
 as I do about this issue and who are yet in complete disagreement with me 
 My respect and admiration for these men and their views was great when I came to this 
 convention It is now far greater because of the sincerity the courtesy and the forthrightness 
 with which many of them have argued in our prolonged discussions in the platform 
 committee 
 Because of this very great respect and because of my profound belief that we have a 
 challenging task to do here because good conscience decent morality demands it I feel I 
 must rise at this time to support a report the minority report a report that spells out our 
 democracy a report that the people of this country can and will understand and a report that 
 they will enthusiastically acclaim on the great issue of civil rights 
  
  
 
                           
       
       
            
     
     
                                                   
 Now let me say this at the outset that this proposal is made for no single region Our proposal 
 is made for no single class for no single racial or religious group in mind All of the regions of 
 this country all of the states have shared in our precious heritage of American freedom All 
 the states and all the regions have seen at least some of the infringements of that freedom 
 all people get this all people white and black all groups all racial groups have been the 
 victims at time[s in this nation of let me say vicious discrimination 
 The masterly statement of our keynote speaker the distinguished United States Senator from 
 Kentucky Alben Barkley made that point with great force Speaking of the founder of our 
 Party Thomas Jefferson he said this and I quote from Alben Barkley  
 He did not proclaim that all the white or the black or the red or the yellow men are equal 
 that all Christian or Jewish men are equal that all Protestant and Catholic men are equal that 
 all rich and poor men are equal that all good and bad men are equal What he declared was 
 that all men are equal and the equality which he proclaimed was the equality in the right to 
 enjoy the blessings of free government in which they may participate and to which they have 
 given their support 
 Now these words of Senator Barkley ’s are appropriate to this convention appropriate to this 
 convention of the oldest the most truly progressive political party in America From the time 
 of Thomas Jefferson the time when that immortal American doctrine of individual rights 
 under just and fairly administered laws the Democratic Party has tried hard to secure 
 expanding freedoms for all citizens Oh yes I know other political parties may have talked 
 more about civil rights but the Democratic party has surely done more about civil rights 
 We have made progress we 've made great progress in every part of this country We ’ve 
 made great progress in the South we ’ve made it in the West in the North and in the East 
 But we must now focus the direction of that progress towards the towards the realization of 
 a full program of civil rights to all This convention must set out more specifically the direction 
 in which our Party efforts are to go 
 We can be proud that we can be   trail blazing of two great 
 Democratic Presidents We can be proud of the fact that our great and beloved immortal 
 leader Franklin Roosevelt gave us guidance And we be proud of the fact we can be proud of 
 the fact that Harry Truman has had the courage to give to the people of America the new 
 emancipation proclamation 
  
  
 
                           
       
       
            
     
     
                                                   
 It seems to me It seems to me that the Democratic Party needs to to make definite pledges 
 of the kinds suggested in the minority report to maintain the trust and the confidence placed 
 in   of all races and all sections of this country Sure we ’re here as Democrats 
 But my good friends we ’re here as Americans we ’re here as the believers in the principle and 
 the ideology of democracy and I firmly believe that as men concerned with our country ’s 
 future we must specify in our platform the guarantees which we have mentioned in the 
 minority report 
 Yes this is far more than a Party matter Every citizen in this country has a stake in the 
 emergence of the United States as a leader in the free world That world is being challenged 
 by the world of slavery For us to play our part effectively we must be in a morally sound 
 position  
 We ca n’t use a double standard There ’s no room for double standards in American politics 
 for measuring our own and other people ’s policies Our demands for democratic practices in 
 other lands will be no more effective than the guarantee of those practices in our own country 
 Friends delegates I do not believe that there can be any compromise on the guarantees of 
 the civil rights which we have mentioned in the minority report In spite of my desire for 
 unanimous agreement on the entire platform in spite of my desire to see everybody here in 
 honest and unanimous agreement there are some matters which I think must be stated 
 clearly and without qualification There can be no hedging the newspaper headlines are 
 wrong There will be no hedging and there will be no watering down if you please of the 
 instruments and the principles of the civil rights program 
 My friends to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights I say to them we are 
 172 years late To those who say that this civil rights program is an infringement on states 
 rights I say this The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the 
 shadow of states rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights 
 People human beings this is the issue of the 20th century People of all kinds all sorts 
 of people and these people are looking to America for leadership and they ’re looking to 
 America for precept and example 
 My good friends my fellow Democrats I ask you for a calm consideration of our historic 
 opportunity Let us do forget the evil passions and the blindness of the past In these times of 
 world economic political and spiritual above all spiritual crisis we can not and we must not 
 turn from the path so plainly before us That path has already lead us through many valleys of 
  
  
 
                           
       
       
            
     
     
                                                   
 the shadow of death And now is the time to recall those who were left on that path of 
 American freedom 
 For all of us here for the millions who have sent us for the whole two billion members of the 
 human family our land is now more than ever before the last best hope on earth And I 
 know that we can and I know that we shall began sic here the fuller and richer realization of 
 that hope that promise of a land where all men are truly free and equal and each man uses 
 his freedom and equality wisely well 
 My good friends I ask my Party I ask the Democratic Party to march down the high road of 
 progressive democracy I ask this convention to say in unmistakable terms that we proudly 
 hail and we courageously support our President and leader Harry Truman in his great fight

42,Woodrow Wilson,Final Address in Support of the League of Nations,1919," 
 
 Mr. Chairman and fellow countrymen 
 It is with a great deal of genuine pleasure that I find myself in Pueblo and I feel it a 
 compliment in this beautiful hall One of the advantages of this hall as I look about is that 
 you are not too far away from me because there is nothing so reassuring to men who are 
 trying to express the public sentiment as getting into real personal contact with their fellow 
 citizens I have gained a renewed impression as I have crossed the continent this time of the 
 homogeneity of this great people to whom we belong They come from many stocks but they 
 are all of one kind They come from many origins but they are all shot through with the same 
 principles and desire the same righteous and honest things I have received a more inspiring 
 impression this time of the public opinion of the United States than it was ever my privilege to 
 receive before 
 The chief pleasure of my trip has been that it has nothing to do with my personal fortunes 
 that it has nothing to do with my personal reputation that it has nothing to do with anything 
 except great principles   all sorts and of all parties which we are now 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 trying to realize at this crisis of the affairs of the world But there have been unpleasant 
 impressions as well as pleasant impressions my fellow citizens as I have crossed the 
 continent I have perceived more and more that men have been busy creating an absolutely 
 false impression of what the treaty of peace and the Covenant of the League of Nations 
 contain and mean I find moreover that there is an organized propaganda against the 
 League of Nations and against the treaty proceeding from exactly the same sources that the 
 organized propaganda proceeded from which threatened this country here and there with 
 disloyalty and I want to say I can not say too often any man who carries a hyphen about 
 with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever 
 he gets ready  
 If I can catch any man with a hyphen in this great contest I will know that I have got an 
 enemy of the Republic My fellow citizens it is only certain bodies of foreign sympathies 
 certain bodies of sympathy with foreign nations that are organized against this great 
 document which the American representatives have brought back from Paris Therefore in 
 order to clear away the mists in order to remove the impressions in order to check the 
 falsehoods that have clustered around this great subject I want to tell you a few very simple 
 things about the treaty and the covenant 
 Do not think of this treaty of peace as merely a settlement with Germany It is that It is a 
 very severe settlement with Germany but there is not anything in it that she did not earn 
 Indeed she earned more than she can ever be able to pay for and the punishment exacted of 
 her is not a punishment greater than she can bear and it is absolutely necessary in order that 
 no other nation may ever plot such a thing against humanity and civilization But the treaty is 
 so much more than that It is not merely a settlement with Germany it is a readjustment of 
 those great injustices which underlie the whole structure of European and Asiatic society This 
 is only the first of several treaties They are all constructed upon the same plan The Austrian 
 treaty follows the same lines The treaty with Hungary follows the same lines The treaty with 
 Bulgaria follows the same lines The treaty with Turkey when it is formulated will follow the 
 same lines  
 What are those lines They are based upon the purpose to see that every government dealt 
 with in this great settlement is put in the hands of the people and taken out of the hands of 
 coteries and of sovereigns who had no right to rule over the people It is a people ’s treaty 
 that   sweep of practical justice the liberation of men who never could 
 have liberated themselves and the power of the most powerful nations ahs been devoted not 
 to their aggrandizement but to the liberation of people whom they could have put under their 
 control if they had chosen to do so Not one foot of territory is  
  
  
 
 
 
            
 their authority is  men who sat around the table in Paris knew that 
 the time had come when the people were no longer going to consent to live under masters 
 but were going to live the lives that they chose themselves to live under such governments 
 as they chose themselves to erect That is the fundamental principle of this great settlement 
 And we did not stop with that We added a great international charter for the rights of labor 
 Reject this treaty impair it and this is the consequence of the laboring men of the world that 
 there is no international tribunal which can bring the moral judgments of the world to bear 
 upon the great labor questions of the day What we need to do with regard to the labor 
 questions of the day my fellow countrymen is to lift them into the light is to lift them out of 
 the haze and distraction of passion of hostility out into the calm spaces where men look at 
 things without passion  
 The more men you get into a great discussion the more you exclude passion Just as soon as 
 the calm judgment of the worlds is directed upon the question of justice to labor labor is 
 going to have to forum such as it never was supplied with before and men everywhere are 
 going to see that the problem of labor is nothing more not less than the problem of the 
 elevation of humanity We must see that all the questions which have disturbed the world all 
 the questions which have disturbed the processes of industry shall be brought out where men 
 of all points of view Men of all attitudes of mind men of all kinds of experience may 
 contribute their part of the settlement of the great questions which we must settle and can not 
 ignore 
 At the front of this great treaty is put the Covenant of the League of Nations It will also be at 
 the front of the Austrian treaty and the Hungarian treaty and the Bulgarian treaty and the 
 treaty with Turkey Every one of them will contain the Covenant of the League of Nations 
 because you can not work any of them without the Covenant of the League of Nations 
 Unless you get the united concerted purpose and power of the great Governments of the 
 world behind this settlement it will fall down like a house of cards There is only one power to 
 put behinds the liberation of mankind and that is the power of mankind It is the power of the 
 united moral forces of the world and in the Covenant of the League of Nations the moral 
 forces of the world are mobilized  
 For what purpose Reflect my fellow citizens that the membership of this great League is 
 going to include all the great fighting nations of the world as well as the weak ones It is not 
 for the present going to include Germany but for the time being Germany is not a great 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 fighting country All the nations that have power that can be mobilized are going to be 
 members of this League including the United States  
 And what do they unite for They enter into a solemn promise to one another they will never 
 use their power against one another for aggression that they never will impair the territorial 
 integrity of a neighbor that they never will interfere with the political independence of a 
 neighbor that they will   that great populations are entitled to determine 
 their own destiny and that they will not interfere with that destiny and that no matter what 
 differences arise amongst them they will never resort to war without first having done one or 
 other of two things either submitted the matter of controversy to arbitration in which case 
 they agree to   without question or submitted it to the consideration of the 
 council of the League of Nations laying before that council all the documents all the facts 
 agreeing that the council can publish the documents all the facts agreeing that the council 
 can publish the documents and the facts to the whole world agreeing that there shall be six 
 months allowed for the mature consideration of those and agreeing that 
 at the expiration of the six months even if they are not then ready to accept the advice of the 
 council with regard to the settlement of the dispute they will still not go to war for another 
 three months  
 In other words they consent no matter what happens to submit every matter of difference 
 between them to the judgment of mankind and just so certainly as they do that my fellow 
 citizens war will be in the far background war will be pushed out of that foreground of terror 
 in which it has kept the world for generation after generation and men will know that there 
 will be a calm time of deliberate counsel The most dangerous thing for a bad cause is to 
 expose it to the opinion of the world 
 The most certain way that you can prove that a man is mistaken   his neighbors 
 know what he  his neighbors know what he  his 
 neighbors discuss what he thinks and if he is in the wrong you will notice that he will stay at 
 home he will not walk on the street He will be afraid of the eyes of his neighbors He will be 
 afraid of their judgment of his character He will know that his cause is lost unless he can 
 sustain   of right and of justice The same law that applies to individuals 
 applies to nations  
 But you say We have heard that we might be at a disadvantage in the League of Nations 
 Well whoever told you that either was deliberately falsifying or he had not read the Covenant 
 of the League of Nations I leave him the choice I want to give you a very simple account of 
 the organization of the League of Nations and let you judge for yourselves It is a very simple 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 organization The power of the League or rather the activities of the league lie in two bodies 
 There is the council which consists of one representative from each of the principal allied and 
 associated powers that is to say the United States Great Britain France Italy and Japan 
 along with four other representatives of smaller powers chosen out of the general body of the 
 membership of the League  
 The council is the source of very active policy of the League and no active policy of the 
 League can be adopted without a unanimous vote of the council That is explicitly stated in the 
 Covenant itself Does it not evidently follow that the League of Nations can adopt no policy 
 whatever without the consent of the United States The affirmative vote of the representative 
 of the United States is necessary in every case Now you have heard of six votes belonging to 
 the British Empire Those six votes are not in the council They are in the assembly and the 
 interesting thing is that the assembly does not vote I must qualify that statement a little but 
 essentially it is absolutely true In every matter in which the assembly is given a voice and 
 there are only four or five its vote does not count unless concurred  
 of all the nations represented on the council so the at there is no validity to any vote of the 
 assembly unless in that vote also the representative of the United States concurs That one 
 vote of the United States is as big as the six votes of the British Empire I am not jealous for 
 advantage my fellow citizens but I think that is a perfectly safe situation There is no validity 
 in a vote   or the assembly in which we do not concur So much for the 
 statements about the six votes for the British Empire 
 Look at it in another aspect The assembly is the talking body The assembly was created in 
 order that anybody that purposed anything wrong should be subjected to the awkward 
 circumstance that everybody could talk about it This is the great assembly in which all the 
 things that are likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding between 
 nations are to be exposed to the general view and I want to ask you if you think it was 
 unjust unjust to the United States that speaking parts should be assigned to the several 
 portions of the British Empire Do you think it unjust that there should be some spokesman in 
 debate for that fine little stout Republic down in the Pacific New Zealand Do you think it was 
 unjust that Australia should be allowed to stand up and take part in the debate Australia 
 from which we have learned some of the most useful progressive policies of modern time a 
 little nation only five million in a great continent but counting for several times five in its 
 activities and in its interest in liberal reform Do you think it unjust that that little Republic 
 down in South Africa whose gallant resistance to being subjected to any outside authority at 
 all we admired for so many months and whose fortunes we followed with such interest should 
 have a speaking part Great Britain obliged South Africa to submit to her sovereignty but she 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 immediately after that felt that it was convenient and right to hand the whole self government 
 of that colony over to the very men whom she had beaten  
 The representatives of South Africa in Paris were two of the most distinguished generals of the 
 Boer Army two of the realest men I ever met two men that could talk sober counsel and wise 
 advice along with the best statesmen in Europe To exclude Gen. Botha and Gen. Smuts from 
 the right to stand up in the parliament of the world and say something concerning the affairs 
 of mankind would be absurd And what about Canada Is not Canada a good neighbor I ask 
 you is not Canada more likely to agree with the United States than with Great Britain Canada 
 has a speaking part And then for the first time in the history of the world that great 
 voiceless multitude that throng hundreds of millions strong in India has a voice and I want 
 to testify that some of the wisest and most dignified figures in the peace conference at Paris 
 came form India men who seemed to carry in their minds an older wisdom than the rest of us 
 had whose traditions ran back into so many of the unhappy fortunes of mankind that they 
 seemed very useful counselors as to how some ray of hope and some prospect of happiness 
 could be opened to its people I for my part have no jealousy whatever of those five speaking 
 parts in the assembly Those speaking parts can not translate themselves into five votes that 
 can in any matter override the voice and purpose of the United States 
 Let us sweep aside all this language of jealousy Let us be big enough to know the facts and to 
 welcome the facts because the facts are based upon the principle that America has always 
 fought for namely the equality of self governing peoples whether they were big or little 
 not counting men but counting rights not counting representation but counting the purpose 
 of that representation When you hear an opinion quoted you do no count the number of 
 persons who hold it you ask Who said that You weigh opinions you do not count them 
 and the beauty of all democracies is that every voice can be heard every voice can have its 
 effect every voice can contribute to the general judgment that is finally arrived at That is the 
 object of democracy Let us accept what America has always fought for and accept it with 
 pride that America showed the way and made the proposal I do not mean that America made 
 the proposal in this particular instance I mean that the principle was an American principle 
 proposed by America 
 When you come to the heart of the Covenant my fellow citizens you will find it in article ten 
 and I am very much interested to know that the other things have been blown away like 
 bubbles There is nothing in the other contentions with regard to the league of nations but 
 there is something in article ten that you ought to realize and ought to accept or reject Article 
 ten is the heart of the whole matter What is article ten I never am certain that I can from 
 memory give a literal repetition of its language but I am sure that I can give an exact 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 interpretation of its meaning Article ten provides that every member of the league covenants 
 to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and existing political independence of every 
 other member of the league as against external aggression Not against internal disturbance 
 There was not a man at that table who did not admit the sacredness of the right of self- 
 determination the sacredness of the right of any body of people to say that they would not 
 continue to live under the Government they were then living under and under article eleven 
 of the Covenant they are given a place to say whether they will live under it or not For 
 following article ten is article eleven which makes it the right of any member of the League at 
 any time to call attention to anything anywhere that is likely to disturb the peace of the 
 world or the good understanding between nations upon which the peace of the world depends 
 I want to give you an illustration of what that would mean  
 You have heard a great deal something that was true and a great deal that was false-- 
 about the provision of the treaty which hands over to Japan the rights which Germany enjoyed 
 in the Province of Shantung in China In the first place Germany did not enjoy any rights 
 there that other nations had not already claimed 
 For my part my judgment my moral judgment is against the whole set of concessions They 
 were all of them unjust to China they ought never to have been exacted they were all 
  a great body of thoughtful and ancient and helpless people There 
 never was any right in any of them Thank God America never asked for any never dreamed 
 of asking for any  
 But when Germany got this concession in 1898 the Government of the United States made no 
 protest whatever That was not because the Government of the United States was not in the 
 hands of thigh minded and conscientious men It was William McKinley was President and 
 John Hay was Secretary of State as safe hands to leave the honor of the United States in as 
 any that you can cite They made no protest because the state of international law a that time 
 was that it was none of their business unless they could show that the interests of the United 
 States were affected and the only think that they could show with regard to the interests of 
 the United States was that Germany might close the doors of Shantung Province against the 
 trade of the United States  
 They therefore demanded and obtained promises that we could continue to sell merchandise 
 in Shantung Immediately following that concession to Germany there was a concession to 
 Russia of the same sort of Port Arthur and Port Arthur was handed over subsequently to 
 Japan on the very territory of the United States Do n’t you remember that when Russia and 
 Japan got into war with one another the war was brought to a   written at 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 Portsmouth N.H. and in that treaty without the slightest intimation from any authoritative 
 sources in America that the Government of the United States had any objection Port Arthur 
 Chinese territory was turned over to Japan I want you distinctly to understand that there is 
 no thought of criticism in my mind I am expounding to you a state of international law  
 Now read articles ten and eleven You will see that international law is revolutionized by 
 putting morals into it Article ten says that no member of the League and that includes all 
 these nations that have demanded these things unjustly of China shall impair the territorial 
 integrity or the political independence of any other member of the League China is going to 
 be a member of the League Article eleven says that nay member of the League can call 
 attention to anything that is likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding 
 between nations and China is for the first time in the history of mankind afforded a standing 
 before the jury of the world 
 I for my part have a profound sympathy for China and I am proud to have taken part in an 
 arrangement which promises the protection of the world to the rights o China The whole 
 atmosphere of the world is   like that my fellow citizens The whole 
 international practice of the world is revolutionized 
 But you will say What is the second sentence of article ten That is what gives very 
 disturbing thoughts The second sentence is that the council of the League shall advise what 
 steps if any are necessary to carry out the guaranty of the first sentence namely that the 
 members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of the 
 other members I do not know any other meaning for the word advise except advise The 
 council advises and it can not advise without the vote of the United States Why gentlemen 
 should fear that the Congress of the United States would be advised to do something that it 
 did not want to do I frankly can not imagine because they can not even be advised to do 
 anything unless their own representative has participated in the advice  
 It may be that that will impair somewhat the vigor of the League but nevertheless the fact 
 is so that we are not obliged to take any advice except our own which to any man who wants 
 to go his own course is a very satisfactory state of affairs Every man regards his own advice 
 as best and I dare say every man mixes his own advice with some thought of his own 
 interest Whether we use it wisely or unwisely we can use the vote of the United States to 
 make impossible drawing the United States into any enterprise that she does not care to be 
 drawn into 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 Yet article ten strikes at the taproot of war Article ten is a statement that the very things that 
 have always been sought in imperialistic wars are henceforth  
 nation in the world I would have felt very much disturbed if sitting at the peace table in 
 Paris I had supposed that I was expounding my own ideas Whether you believe it or not I 
 know the relative size of my own ideas I know how they stand related in bulk and proportion 
 to the moral judgments of my fellow countrymen and I proposed nothing whatever at the 
 peace table at Paris that I had not sufficiently certain knowledge embodied the moral 
 judgment of the citizens of the United States I had gone over there with so to say explicit 
 instruction Do n’t you remember that we laid down fourteen points which should contain the 
 principles of the settlement 
 They were not my points 
 In every one of them I was conscientiously trying to read the thought of the people of the 
 United States and after I uttered those points I had every assurance given me that could be 
 given me that they did speak the moral judgment of the United States and not my single 
 judgment  
 Then when it came to that critical period just a little less than a year ago when it was evident 
 that the war was coming to its critical end all the nations engaged in the war accepted those 
 fourteen principles explicitly as the basis of the armistice and the basis of the peace In those 
 circumstances I crossed the ocean under bond to my own people and to the other 
 governments with which I was dealing The whole specification of the method of settlement 
 was written down and accepted before hand and we were architects building on those 
 specifications It reassures me and fortifies my position to find how before I went over men 
 whose judgment the United States has often trusted were of exactly the same opinion that I 
 went abroad to express Here is something I want to read from Theodore Roosevelt 
 The one effective move for obtaining peace   among all the great powers in 
 which each should pledge itself no only to   of a common tribunal but to 
 back its  great civilized nations should  
 in a great would league for the peace of righteousness a court should be established A 
 changed and amplified Hague court would meet the requirements composed of 
 representatives from each nation whose representatives are sworn to act as judges in each 
 case and not in a representative capacity Now there is article ten He goes on and says this 
 The nations should agree on certain rights that should not be questioned such as territorial 
 integrity their right to deal with their domestic affairs and with such matters as whom they 
  
  
 
 
 
            0 
 should admit to citizenship All such guarantee each of their number in possession of these 
 rights 
 Now the other specification is the Covenant The Covenant in another portion guarantees to 
 the members the independent control of their domestic questions There is not a leg of these 
 gentlemen to stand on when they say that the interests of the United States are not 
 safeguarded in the very points where we are most sensitive You do not need to be told again 
 that the Covenant expressly says that nothing in this covenant shall be construed as affecting 
 the validity of the Monroe doctrine for example You could not be more explicit than that And 
 every point of interest is covered partly for one very interesting reason 
 This is not the first time that the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate of the United 
 States ahs read and considered this covenant I bought it to this country in March last in a 
 tentative provisional form in practically the form that it now has with the exception of 
 certain additions which I shall mention immediately I asked the Foreign Relations Committees 
 of both Houses to come to the White House and we spent a long evening in the frankest 
 discussion of every portion that they wished to discuss They made certain specific 
 suggestions as to what should be contained in this document when it was to be revised I 
 carried those suggestions to Paris and every one of them was adopted What more could I 
 have done What more could have been obtained The very matters upon which these 
 gentlemen were most concerned were the right of withdrawal which is now expressly stated 
 the safeguarding of the Monroe doctrine whish is now accomplished/ the exclusion from 
  of domestic questions which is now accomplished All along the line 
 every suggestion of the United States was adopted after the Covenant had been drawn up in 
 its first form and had been published of the criticism of the world There is a very true sense 
 in which I can say this is a tested American document 
 I am dwelling upon these points my fellow citizens in spite of the fact that I dare say to most 
 of you they are perfectly well know because in order to meet the present situation we have 
 go to know what we are dealing with We are not dealing with the kind of document which this 
 is   to be and inasmuch as we are dealing with a document 
 simon pure in respect of the very principles we have professed and lived up to we have got to 
 do one or other of two things we have go to adopt it or reject it There is no middle course 
 You can not go in on a special privilege basis of your own  
 
  
  
 
 
 
            1 
 I take it that you are too proud to ask to be exempted from responsibilities which the other 
 members of the League will carry We go in upon equal terms or we do not go in at all and if 
 we do not go in my fellow citizens think of the tragedy of that result the only sufficient 
 guaranty to the peace of the world withheld Ourselves drawn apart with that dangerous pride 
 which means that we shall be ready to take care of ourselves and that means that we shall 
 maintain great standing armies and an irresistible envy that means we shall have the 
 organization of a military nation that means we shall have a general staff with the kind of 
 power that the general staff of Germany had to mobilize this great manhood of the Nation 
 when it pleases all the energy of our young men drawn into the thought and preparation for 
 war What of our pledges to the men that lie dead in France 
 We said that they went over there not to prove the prowess of America or her readiness for 
 another war but to see to tit hat there never was such a war again It always seems to make 
 it difficult for me to say anything my fellow citizens when I think of my clients in this case My 
 clients are the children my clients are the next generation They do not know what promises 
 and bonds I undertook when I ordered the armies of the United States to the soil of France 
 but I know and I intend to redeem my pledges to the children they shall not be sent upon a 
 similar errand 
 Again and again my fellow citizens mothers who lost their sons in France have come to me 
 and taking my hand have shed tears upon it not only but they added God bless you Mr. 
 President Why my fellow citizens should they pray God to bless me I advised the Congress 
 of the United States to create the situation that led to the death of their sons I ordered their 
 sons overseas I consented to their sons being put in the most difficult parts of the battle line 
 where death was certain as in the impenetrable difficulties of the forest of Argonne Why 
 should they weep upon my hand and call down the blessings of God upon me Because they 
 believe that their boys died for something that vastly transcends any of the immediate and 
 palpable objects of the war They believe and they rightly believe that their sons saved the 
 liberty of the world They believe that wrapped up with the liberty of the world is the 
 continuous protection of that   powers of all civilized people They 
 believe that this sacrifice was made in order that other sons should not be called upon for a 
 similar gift the gift of life the gift of all that died and if we did not see this thing through 
 if we fulfilled the dearest present wish of Germany and now dissociated ourselves from those 
 alongside whom we fought in the world would not something of the halo go away from the 
 gun over the mantelpiece or the sword

 Would not the old uniform lose something of its significance These men were crusaders They 
 were not going forth to prove the might of the United States They were going forth to prove 
 the might of justice and right and all the world accepted them as crusaders and their 
 transcendent achievement has made all the world believe in America as it believes in no other 
 nation organized in the modern world There seem to me to stand between us and the 
 rejection or qualification of this treaty the serried ranks of those boys in khaki not only these 
 boys who came home but those dear ghosts that still deploy upon the fields of France 
 My friends on last Decoration day I went on a beautiful hillside near Paris where was located 
 the cemetery of Suresnes a cemetery given over to the burial of the American dead Behind 
 me on the slopes was rank upon rank of living American soldiers and lying before me upon 
 the levels of the plain was rank upon rank of departed American soldiers   of 
 the stand where I spoke there was a little group of French women who had adopted those 
 graves had made themselves mothers of those dear   every day 
 upon those graves taking them as their own sons their own beloved because they had died 
 in the same cause France was free and the world was free because America had come I 
 wish some men in public life who are now opposing the settlement for which these men died 
 could visit such a spot as that I wish that the thought that comes out of those graves could 
 penetrate their consciousness I wish that they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon 
 us not to go back on those boys but to see the thing through to see it through to the end 
 and make good their redemption of the world For nothing less depends upon this decision 
 nothing less than liberation and salvation of the world 
 You will say Is the League and absolute guaranty against war No I do not know any 
 absolute guaranty against the errors of human judgment or the violence of human passion 
 but I tell you this With a cooling space of nine months for human passion not much of it will 
 keep hot I had a couple of friends who were in the habit of losing their tempers and when 
 they lost their tempers they were in the habit of using very unparliamentary language Some 
 of their friends induced them to make a promise that they never would swear inside the town 
 limits When the impulse next came upon them they took a streetcar to go out of town to 
 swear   they got out of town they did not want to swear They came back 
 convinced that they were just what they were a couple of unspeakable fools and the habit of 
 getting angry and of swearing suffered great inroads upon  
 Now illustrating the that is true of the passion s of nations It is true of 
 the passions of men however you combine them Give them space to cool off I ask you this 
 If it is not an absolute insurance against war do you want no insurance at all Do you want 
 nothing Do you want not only no probability that war will not recur but the probability that it 
  
  
 
 
 
            3 
 will recur The arrangements of justice do not stand of themselves my fellow citizens The 
 arrangements of this treat are just but they need the support of the combined power of the 
 great nations of the world And they will have that support Now that the mists of this great 
 question have cleared away I believe that men will see the truth eye to eye and face to face  
 There is one thing that the American people always rise to and extend their hand to and that 
 is the truth of justice and of liberty and of peace We have accepted the truth and we are 
 going to be  it is going to lead us and through us the world out into pastures of 
 quietness and peace such as the world never dreamed of before",0.0150778824463486,0.015700839459896,0.1408657878637313,0.76255863904953,0.0525017865002155,0.0102009167894721,0.0030941360164433,0.1791112700858464,0.5145782277985669,55.61372874182382,0.198170731707317,0.008499787505312367,0.06219918548685672,0.02693965517241379,30.296137339055793,1.0
43,Barbara Bush,Commencement Address at Wellesley College,1990," 
 
 
 Thank you very very much President Keohane Mrs. Gorbachev Trustees faculty parents 
 and I should say Julia Porter class president and certainly my new best friend Christine 
 Bicknell and of course the Class of 1990 I am really thrilled to be here today and very 
 excited as I know all of you must be that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us 
 These These are exciting times They 're exciting in Washington and I have really looked 
 forward to coming to Wellesley I thought it was going to be fun I never dreamt it would be 
 this much fun So thank you for that 
 More than ten years ago when I was invited here to talk about our experiences in the 
 People 's Republic of China I was   natural beauty of your campus and the 
 spirit of this place 
 Wellesley you see is not just a place but an idea an experiment in excellence in which 
 diversity is not just tolerated but is embraced The essence of this spirit was captured in a 
 moving speech about tolerance given last   body president of one of your 
 sister colleges She related the   about a young pastor finding himself 
 in charge of some very energetic children hits upon the game called Giants Wizards and 
 Dwarfs 
  
  
 
               
     
     
             
 You have to decide now the pastor instructed the children which you are a giant a 
 wizard or a dwarf At that a small girl tugging at his pants leg asked But where do the 
 mermaids stand And the pastor tells her there are no mermaids And she says Oh yes 
 there are they are I am a mermaid 
 Now this little girl knew what she was and she was not about to give up on either her 
 identity or the game She intended to take her place wherever mermaids fit into the scheme 
 of things Where do the mermaids stand All of those who are different those who do not fit 
 the boxes and the pigeonholes Answer that question wrote Fulghum And you can build a 
 school a nation or a whole world As that very wise young woman said Diversity like 
 anything worth having requires effort effort to learn about and respect difference to be 
 compassionate with one another to cherish our own identity and to accept unconditionally 
 the same in others 
 You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit Now I know your first choice 
 today was Alice Walker guess how I know known for The Color Purple Instead you got 
 me known for the color of my hair Alice Walker 's book has a special resonance here At 
 Wellesley each class is   color For four years the Class of 90 has worn the 
 color purple Today you meet on Severance Green to say goodbye to all of that to begin a 
 new and a very personal journey to search for your own true colors 
 In the world that awaits you beyond the shores of Waban Lake Waban no one can say 
 what your true colors will be But this I do know You have a first class education from a first 
 class school And so you need not probably can not live a  Decisions 
 are not irrevocable Choices do come back And as you set off from Wellesley I hope that 
 many of you will consider making three very special choices 
 The first is to believe in something larger than yourself to get involved in some of the big 
 ideas of our time I chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read 
 write and comprehend we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems 
 that plague our nation and our society 
 And early on I made another choice which I hope you 'll make as well Whether you are 
 talking about education career or service you 're talking about life and life really must 
 have joy It 's supposed to be fun 
 
  
  
 
               
     
     
             
 One of the reasons I made the most important decision of my life to marry George Bush is 
 because he made me laugh It 's true sometimes we 've laughed through our tears but that 
 shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds Find the joy in life because as Ferris 
 Bueller said on his day off Life moves pretty fast and you do n't stop and look around once 
 in a while you 're going to miss it 
 I 'm not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than you clapped for George 
 The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human connections your 
 relationships with family and friends For several years you 've had impressed upon you the 
 importance to your career of dedication and hard work And of course that 's true But as 
 important as your obligations as a doctor a lawyer a business leader will be you are a 
 human being first And those human connections with spouses with children with friends 
 are the most important investments you will ever make 
 At the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test winning one 
 more verdict or not closing one more deal You will regret time not spent with a husband a 
 child a friend or a parent 
 We are in a transitional period right now We are in a transitional period right now 
 fascinating and exhilarating times learning to adjust to changes and the choices we men and 
 women are facing As an example I remember what a friend said on hearing her husband 
 complain to his buddies that he had to babysit Quickly setting him straight my friend told her 
 husband that when it 's your own kids it 's not called babysitting  
 Now maybe we should adjust faster maybe we should adjust slower But whatever the era 
 twenty whatever the era whatever the times one thing will never change fathers and 
 mothers if you have children they must come first You must read to your children and you 
 must hug your children and you must love your children Your success as a family our 
 success as a society depends not on what happens in the White House but on what happens 
 inside your house 
 For over fifty years it was said that the winner of Wellesley 's annual hoop race would be the 
 first to get married Now they say the winner will be the first to become a C.E.O. Both Both 
 of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those who want to know where the mermaids 
 stand So So I want to offer a new legend the winner of the hoop race will be the first to 
 realize her dream not society 's dreams   her own personal dream 
  
  
 
               
     
     
             
 And who Who knows Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one 
 day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the President 's spouse and 
 I wish him well 
 Well the controversy ends here But our conversation is only beginning And a worthwhile 
 conversation it has been So as you leave Wellesley today take with you deep thanks for the 
 courtesy and the honor you have shared with Mrs. Gorbachev and with me 
 Thank you God bless you And may your future be worthy of your dreams",0.0037771861534565,0.001062897965312,0.0051677711308002,0.9531596899032592,0.0134244682267308,0.0022185689304023,0.021189285442233,0.2540822510822511,0.4765945165945166,69.23504489216256,0.3,0.009696186166774402,0.13805309734513274,0.09552691432903715,20.905405405405407,1.0
44,Huey P. Long,Every Man A King,1934," 
 
 Is that a right of life when the young children of this country are being reared into a sphere 
 which is more owned by 12 men that is by 120 million people  
 Ladies and gentlemen I have only 30 minutes in which to speak to you this evening and I 
 therefore will not be able to discuss in detail so much as I can write when I have all of the 
 time and space that is allowed me for the subjects but I will undertake to sketch them very 
 briefly without manuscript or preparation so that you can understand them so well as I can 
 tell them to you tonight  
 I contend my friends that we have no difficult problem to solve in America and that is the 
 view of nearly everyone with whom I have discussed the matter here in Washington and 
 elsewhere throughout the United States that we have no very difficult problem to solve  
 It is not the difficulty of the problem which we have it is the fact that the rich people of this 
 country   I mean the super rich will not allow us to solve the problems 
 or rather the one little problem that is afflicting this country because in order to cure all of 
 our woes it is necessary to scale down the big fortunes that we may scatter the wealth to be 
  the people  
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 We have a marvelous love for this Government of ours in fact it is almost a religion and it is 
 well that it should be because we have a splendid form of government and we have a 
 splendid set of laws We have everything here that we need except that we have neglected 
 the fundamentals upon which the American Government was principally predicated  
 How may of you remember the first thing that the Declaration of Independence said It said 
 We hold these truths to be self evident that there are certain inalienable rights of the 
 people and among them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and it said further 
 We hold the view that all men are created equal  
 Now what did they  they mean my friends to say that all me were created 
 equal and that that meant that any one man was born to inherit $ 10,000,000,000 and that 
 another child was to be born to inherit nothing  
 Did that mean my friends that someone would come into this world without having had an 
 opportunity of course to have hit one lick of work should be born with more than it and all of 
 its children and children 's children could ever dispose of but that another one would have to 
 be born into a life of starvation  
 That was not the meaning of the Declaration of Independence when it said that all men are 
 created equal of That we hold that all men are created equal  
 Now was it the meaning of the Declaration of Independence when it said that they held that 
 there were certain rights that were inalienable the right of life liberty and the pursuit of 
 happiness Is that right of life my friends when the young children of this country are being 
 reared into a sphere which is more owned by 12 men than it is by 120,000,000 people  
 Is that my friends giving them a fair shake of the dice or anything like the inalienable right of 
 life liberty and the pursuit of happiness or anything resembling the fact that all people are 
 created equal when we have today in America thousands and hundreds of thousands and 
 millions of children on the verge of starvation in a land that is overflowing with too much to 
 eat and too much to wear I do not think you will contend that and I do not think for a 
 moment that they will contend it  
 Now let us see if we can not return this Government to the Declaration of Independence and 
 see if we are going to do anything regarding it Why should we hesitate or why should we 
 quibble or why should we quarrel with one another to find out what the difficulty is when we 
 know what the Lord told us what the difficulty is and Moses wrote it out so a blind man could 
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 see it then Jesus told us all about it and it was later written in the Book of James where 
 everyone could read it  
 I refer to the Scriptures now my friends and give you what it says not for the purpose of 
 convincing you of the wisdom of myself not for the purpose ladies and gentlemen of 
 convincing you of the fact that I am quoting the Scripture means that I am to be more 
 believed than someone else but I quote you the Scripture rather refer you to the Scripture 
 because whatever you see there you may rely upon will never be disproved so long as you or 
 your children or anyone may live and you may further depend upon the fact that not one 
 historical fact that the Bible has ever contained has ever yet been  
 discovery   anything that has been disclosed to man through his own individual 
 mind or through the wisdom of the Lord which the Lord has allowed him to have  
 But the Scripture says ladies and gentlemen that no country can survive or for a country to 
 survive it is necessary that we keep the wealth scattered among the people that nothing 
 should be held   person and that 50 years seems to be the year of 
 jubilee in which all property would be scattered about and returned to the sources from which 
 it originally came and every seventh year debt should be remitted  
 Those two things the Almighty said to be necessary I should say He knew to be necessary 
 or else He would not have so prescribed that the property would be kept among the general 
 run of the people and that everyone would continue to share in it so that no one man would 
 get half of it and hand it down to a son who takes half of what was left and that son hand it 
 down to another one who would take half of what was left until like a snowball going 
 downhill all of the snow was off of the ground except what the snowball had  
 I believe that was the judgment and the view and the law of the Lord that we would have to 
 distribute wealth every so often in order that there could not be people starving to death in a 
 land of plenty as there is in America today We have in American today more wealth more 
 goods more food more clothing more houses than we have ever had We have everything in 
 abundance here We have the farm problem my friends because we have too much cotton 
 because we have too much wheat and have too much corn and too much potatoes  
 We have a home loan problem because we have too many houses and yet nobody can buy 
 them and live in them  
 
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 We have trouble my friends in the country because we have too much money owing the 
 greatest indebtedness that has ever been given to civilization where it has been shown that 
 we are incapable of distributing to the actual things that are here because the people have 
 not money enough to supply themselves with them and because the greed of a few men is 
 such that they think it is necessary that they own everything and their pleasure consists in 
 the starvation of the masses and in their possessing things they can not use and their 
 children can not use but who bask in the splendor of sunlight and wealth casting darkness 
 and despair and impressing it on everyone else  
 So therefore said the Lord in effect if you see these things that now have occurred and 
 exist in this and other countries there must be a constant scattering of wealth in any country 
 if this country is to survive  
 Then said the Lord in effect every seventh year there shall be a remission of debts there 
 will be no debts after 7 years That was the law  
 Now let us take America today We have in American today ladies and gentlemen 
 $ 272,000,000,000 of debt Two hundred and seventy two thousand millions of dollars of debts 
 are   people of this country today Why my friends that can not be paid It 
 is not possible for that kind of debt to be paid  
 The entire currency of the United States is only $ 6,000,000,000 That is all of the money that 
 we have got in America today All the actual money you have got in all of your banks all that 
 you have got in the Government Treasury is $ 6,000,000,000 and if you took all that money 
 and paid it out today you would still owe $ 266,000,000,000 and if you took all that money 
 and paid again you would still owe $ 260,000,000,000 and if you took it my friends 20 times 
 and paid it you would still owe $ 150,000,000,000  
 You would have to have 45 times the entire money supply of the United States today to pay 
 the debts of the people of America and then they would just have to start out from scratch 
 without a dime to go on with  
 So my friends it is impossible to pay all of these debts and you might as well find out that it 
 can not be done The United States Supreme Court has definitely found out that it could not be 
 done because in a Minnesota case it held that when a State has postponed the evil day of 
 collecting a debt it was a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative power  
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 Now ladies and gentlemen if I may proceed to give you some other words that I think you 
 can understand I am not going to belabor   I am going to tell you 
 what the wise men of all ages and all times down even to the present day have all said That 
 you must keep the wealth of the country scattered and you must limit the amount that any 
 one man can own You can not let any man own $ 300,000,000,000 or $ 400,000,000,000 If 
 you do one man can own all of the wealth that they United States has in it  
 Now my friends if you were off on an island where there were 100 lunches you could not let 
 one man eat up the hundred lunches or take the hundred lunches and not let anybody else 
 eat any of them If you did there would not be anything else for the balance of the people to 
 consume  
 So we have in America today my friends a   10 men dominate the 
 means of activity in at least 85 percent of the activities that you own They either own directly 
 everything or they have got some kind of mortgage on it with a very small percentage to be 
 excepted They own the banks they own the steel mills they own the railroads they own the 
 bonds they own the mortgages they own the stores and they have chained the country from 
 one end to the other until there is not any kind of business that a small independent man 
 could go into today and make a living and there is not any kind of business that an 
 independent man can go into and make any money to buy an automobile with and they have 
 finally and gradually and steadily eliminated everybody from the fields in which there is a 
 living to be made and still they have got little enough sense to think they ought to be able to 
 get more business out of it anyway  
 If you reduce a man to the point where he is starving to death and bleeding and dying how 
 do you expect that man to get hold of any money to spend with you It is not possible Then 
 ladies and gentlemen how do you expect people to live when the wherewith can not be had 
 by the people  
 In the beginning I quoted from the Scriptures I hope you will understand that I am not 
 quoting Scripture to convince you of my goodness personally because that is a thing between 
 me and my Maker that is something as to how I stand with my Maker and as to how you 
 stand with your Maker That is not concerned with this issue except and unless there are 
 those of you who would be so good as to pray for the souls of some of us But the Lord gave 
 his law and in the Book of James they said so that the rich should weep and howl for the 
 miseries that had come upon them and therefore it was written that when the rich hold 
 goods they could not use and could not consume you will inflict punishment on them and 
 nothing but days of woe ahead of them  
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 Then we have heard of the great Greek philosopher Socrates and the greater Greek 
 philosopher Plato and we have read the dialog between Plato and Socrates in which one said 
 that great riches brought on great poverty and would be destructive of a country Read what 
 they said Read what Plato said that you must not let any one man be too poor and you 
 must not let any one man be too rich that the same mill that grinds out the extra rich is the 
 mill that will grind out the extra poor because in order that the extra rich can become so 
 affluent they must necessarily take more of what ordinarily would belong to the average man  
 It is a very simple process of mathematics that you do not have to study and that no one is 
 going to discuss with you  
 So that was the view of Socrates and Plato That was the view of the English statesmen That 
 was the view of American statesmen That was the view of American statesmen like Daniel 
 Webster Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln William Jennings Bryan and Theodore 
 Roosevelt and even as late as Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt  
 Both of these men Mr. Hoover and Mr. Roosevelt came out and said there had to be a 
 decentralization of wealth but neither one of them did anything about it But nevertheless 
 they recognized the principle The fact that neither one of them ever did anything about it is 
 their own problem that I am not undertaking to criticize but had Mr. Hoover carried out what 
 he says ought to be done he would be retiring from the President 's office very probably 3 
 years from now instead of 1 year ago and had Mr. Roosevelt proceeded along the lines that 
 he stated were necessary for the decentralization of wealth he would have gone my friends 
 a long way already and within a few months he would have probably reached a solution of all 
 of the problems that afflict this country  
 But I wish to warn you now that nothing that has been done up to this date has taken one 
 dime away from these big fortune holders they own just as much as they did and probably a 
 little bit more they hold just as many of the debts of the common people as they ever held 
 and probably a little bit more and unless we my friends are going to give the people of this 
 country a fair shake of the  will all get something out of the funds of this 
 land there is not a chance on the topside of this God 's eternal   can rescue 
 this country and rescue the people of this country  
 It is necessary to save the Government of the country but is much more necessary to save 
 the people of America We love this country We love this Government It is a religion I say 
 It is a kind of religion people have read of when women in the name of religion would take 
 their infant babes and throw them into the burning flame where they would be instantly 
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 -consuming fire in days  probably are some people of 
 the world even today who in the name of religion throw their tear dimmed eyes into the sad 
 faces of their fathers and mothers who can not given them food and clothing they both 
 needed and which is necessary to sustain them and that goes on day after day and night 
 after night when day gets into darkness and blackness knowing those children would arise in 
 the morning without being fed and probably to bed at night without being fed  
 Yet in the name of our Government and all alone those people undertake and strive as hard 
 as they can to keep a good government alive and how long they can stand that no one 
 knows If I were in their place tonight the place where millions are I hope that I would have 
 what I might say I can not give you the word to express the kind of fortitude they have that 
 is the word I hope that I might have the fortitude to praise and honor my Government that 
 had allowed me here in this land where there is too much to eat and too much to wear to 
 starve in order that a handful of men can have so much more than they can ever eat or they 
 can ever wear  
 Now we have organized a society and we call it Share Our Wealth Society a society with 
 the motto every man a king 
 Every man a king so there would be no such thing as a man or woman who did not have the 
 necessities of life who would not be dependent upon the whims and caprices and ipsi dixit of 
 the financial martyrs for a living What do we We propose to limit the 
 wealth of big men in the country There is an average of $ 15,000 in wealth to every family in 
 America That is right here today  
 We do not propose to divide it up equally We do not propose a division of wealth but we 
 propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted upon any man 's family We will not 
 say we are going to try to guarantee any equality or $ 15,000 to families No but we do say 
 that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold that there should be a 
 guaranty of a family wealth of around $ 5,000 enough for a home and automobile a radio 
 and the ordinary conveniences and the opportunity to educate their children a fair share of 
 the income of this land thereafter to that family so there will be no such thing as merely the 
 select to have those things and so there will be no such thing as a family living in poverty and 
 distress  
 
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 We have to limit fortunes Our present plan is that we will allow no one man to own more than 
 $ 50,000,000 We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the 
 program It may be necessary that we limit it to less than $ 50,000,000 It may be necessary 
 in working out of the plans that no man 's fortune would be more than $ 10,000,000 or 
 $ 15,000,000 But be that as it may it will still be more than any one man or any one man 
 and his children and their children will be able to spend in their lifetimes and it is not 
 necessary or reasonable to have wealth piled up beyond that point where we can not prevent 
 poverty among the masses  
 Another thing we propose is old age pension of $ 30 a month for everyone that is 60 years old 
 Now we do not give this pension to a man making $ 1,000 a year and we do not give it to 
 him if he has $ 10,000 in property but outside of that we do  
 We will limit hours of work There is not any necessity of having over production I think all 
 you have got to do ladies and gentlemen is just limit the hours of work to such an extent as 
 people will work only so long as is necessary to produce enough for all of the people to have 
 what they need Why ladies and gentleman let us say that all of these labor saving devices 
 reduce hours down to where you do not have to work but 4 hours a day that is enough for 
 these people and then praise be the name of the Lord if it gets that good Let it be good and 
 not a curse and then we will have 5 hours a day and 5 days a week or even less that that 
 and we might give a man a whole month off during a year or give him 2 months and we 
 might do what other countries have seen fit to do and what I did in Louisiana by having 
  could go back and learn the things that have been discovered since 
 they went to school  
 We will not have any trouble taking care of the agricultural situation All you have to do is 
 balance your production with your consumption You simply have to abandon a particular crop 
 that you have too much of and all you have to do is store the surplus for the next year and 
 the Government will take it over When you have good crops in the area in which the crops 
 that have been planted are sufficient for another year put in your public works in the 
 particular year when you do not need to raise any more   you get 
 everybody employed When the Government has enough of any particular crop to take care of 
 all of the people that will be all that is necessary and in order to do all of this our taxation is 
 going to be to take the billion dollar fortunes and strip them down to frying size not to exceed 
 $ 50,000,000 and it is necessary to come to $ 10,000,000 we will come to $ 10,000,000 We 
 have worked the proposition out to guarantee a limit upon property and no man will own less 
 than one third the average and guarantee a reduction of fortunes and a reduction of hours to 
 spread wealth throughout this country 
  
  
 
                                                           
       
 We would care for the old people above 60 and take them away from this thriving industry 
 and given them a chance to enjoy the necessities and live in ease and thereby lift from the 
 market the labor which would probably create a surplus of commodities  
 Those are the things we propose to do Every man a king Every man to eat when there is 
 something to eat all to wear something when there is something to wear That makes us all 
 sovereign 
 You can not solve these things through these various and sundry alphabetical codes You can 
 have the N.R.A. and P.W.A. and C.W.A. and the U.U.G. and G.I.N. and any other kind of dad- 
 gummed lettered code You can wait until doomsday and see 25 more alphabets but that is 
 not going to solve this proposition Why hide Why quibble You know what the trouble is The 
 man that says he does not know what the trouble is just hiding his face to keep from seeing 
 the sunlight 
 God told you what the trouble was The philosophers told you what the trouble was and when 
 you have a country where one man owns more than 100,000 people or a million people and 
 when you have a country where there are four men as in America that have got more control 
 over things than all the 120,000,000 people together you know what the trouble is  
 We had these great incomes in this country but the farmer who plowed from sunup to 
 sundown who labored here from sunup to sundown for 6 days a week wound up at the end 
 of the with practically nothing  
 And we ought to take care of the veterans of the wars in this program That is a small matter 
 Suppose it does cost a billion dollars a year that means that the money will be scattered 
 throughout this country We ought to pay them a bonus We can do it We ought to take care 
 of every single one of the sick and disabled veterans I do not care whether a man got sick on 
 the battlefield or did not every man that wore the uniform of this country is entitled to be 
 taken care of and there is money enough to do it and we need to spread the wealth of the 
 country which you did not do in what you call the N.R.A. 
 If the N.R.A. has done any good I can put it all in my eye without having it hurt All I can see 
 that N.R.A. has done is to put the little man out of business the little merchant in his store 
 the little Dago that is running a fruit stand or the Greek shoe shining stand who has to take 
 hold of a code of 275 pages and study with a spirit level and compass and looking glass he 
 has to hire a Philadelphia lawyer to tell him what is in the code   he learns 
 what the code is he is in jail or out of business and they have got a chain code system that

 has already put him out of business The N.R.A. is not worth anything and I said so when 
 they put it through  
 Now my friends we have got to hit the root with the axe Centralized power in the hands of a 
 few with centralized credit in the hands of a few is the trouble

45,Woodrow Wilson,War Message,1917," 
 
 Gentlemen of the Congress 
 I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious very serious 
 choices of policy to be made and made immediately which it was neither right nor 
 constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making 
 On the third of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the 
 Imperial German Government that on and after the first day of February it was its purpose to 
 put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that 
 sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of 
 Europe or any of the ports   of Germany within the Mediterranean 
 That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war but 
 since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of 
 its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should 
 not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines 
 might seek to destroy when no resistance was offered or escape attempted and care taken 
 that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 The precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough as was proved in distressing 
 instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain 
 degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside 
 Vessels of every kind whatever their flag their character their cargo their destination their 
 errand have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help 
 or mercy for those on board the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents 
 Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of 
 Belgium though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by 
 the German Government itself and were   of identity 
 haven been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle 
 I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any 
 government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations International 
 law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed 
 upon the seas where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the 
 world By painful stage after stage has that law been built up with meager enough results 
 indeed after all was accomplished that could be accomplished but always with a clear view 
 at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded 
 This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation 
 and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it 
 is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of 
 humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse 
 of the world 
 I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved immense and serious as that is but 
 only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of non combatants men women 
 and children engaged in pursuits which have always even in the darkest periods of modern 
 history been deemed innocent and legitimate Property can be paid for the lives of peaceful 
 and innocent people can not be 
 The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind 
 It is war against all nations 
 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 American ships have been sunk American lives taken in ways which it has stirred us very 
 deeply to learn of but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been 
 sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way There has been no discrimination The 
 challenge is to all mankind 
 Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it The choice we make for ourselves must 
 be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness of judgment befitting our character 
 and our motives as a nation We must put excited feeling away Our motive will not be 
 revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication 
 of right of human right of which we are only a single champion 
 When I addressed the Congress on the twenty sixth of February last I thought that it would 
 suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms our right to use the seas against unlawful 
 interference our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence But armed 
 neutrality it now appears is impracticable Because submarines are in effect outlaws when 
 used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping it is impossible to 
 defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would 
 defend themselves against privateers or cruisers visible craft giving chase upon the open sea 
 It is common prudence in such circumstances grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy 
 them before they have shown their own intention They must be dealt with upon sight if dealt 
 with at all 
 The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the 
 sea which it has proscribed even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever 
 before questioned their right to defend The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards 
 which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and 
 subject to be dealt with as pirates would be Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best in 
 such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual it is likely 
 only to produce what it was meant to prevent it is practically certain to draw us into the war 
 without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents There is one choice we can not 
 make we are incapable of making we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the 
 most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated The wrongs against 
 which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs they cut to the very roots of human 
 life 
 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and 
 of the grave responsibilities which it involves but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem 
 my constitutional duty I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial 
 German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of 
 the United States that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust 
 upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state 
 of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government 
 of the German Empire to terms and end the war 
 What this will involve is clear 
 It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments 
 now at war with Germany and as incident to that the extension to those governments of the 
 most liberal financial credits in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to 
 theirs 
 It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to 
 supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant 
 and yet the most economical and efficient way possible 
 It will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in 
 supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy ’s submarines 
 It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already 
 provided   case of war at least five hundred thousand men who should in my 
 opinion be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service and also the 
 authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be 
 needed and can be handled in training 
 It will involve also of course the granting of adequate credits to the Government sustained 
 I hope so far as they can equitably be    
 taxation 
 I say sustained so far as may be   it seems to me that it would 
 be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed 
 It is our duty I most respectfully urge to protect our people so far as we may against the 
 very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would 
 be  
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 In carrying out the   things are to be accomplished we should keep 
 constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and 
 in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty for it will be a very practical duty 
 of supplying the nations already at war with Germany with the materials which they can 
 obtain only from us   They are in the field and we should help them in 
 every way to be effective there 
 I shall take the liberty of suggesting through the several executive departments of the 
 government for the consideration of your committees measures for the accomplishment of 
 the several objects I have mentioned I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as 
 having been framed after very careful   of the Government upon which 
 the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall 
 While we do these things these deeply momentous things let us be very clear and make 
 very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are My own thought has not 
 been driven from its habitual and normal   events of the last two 
 months and I do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by 
 them I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the 
 Senate on the twenty second of January last the same that I had in mind when I addressed 
 the Congress on the third day of February and on the twenty sixth of February Our object 
 now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as 
 against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self governed 
 peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the 
 observance of those principles 
 Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the 
 freedom of its peoples and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of 
 autocratic governments   which is controlled not 
 by the will of their people We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances We are 
 at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and 
 responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are 
 observed among the individual citizens of civilized states 
 We have no quarrel with the German people We have no feeling towards them but one of 
 sympathy and friendship It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in 
 entering this war It was not with their previous knowledge or approval It was a war 
 determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old unhappy days when peoples 
 were nowhere   and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as 
 pawns and tools 
 Self governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue 
 to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and 
 make conquest Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no 
 one has the right to ask questions Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression 
 carried it may be from generation to generation can be worked out and kept from the light 
 only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and 
 privileged class They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon 
 full information concerning all the nation ’s affairs 
 A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained   of democratic 
 nations No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its 
 covenants It must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion Intrigue would eat its vitals 
 away the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no 
 one would be a corruption seated at its very heart Only free peoples can hold their purpose 
 and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow 
 interest of their own 
 Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace 
 of the   and heartening things that have been happening within the last 
 few weeks in Russia Russia was   knew it best to have been always in 
 fact democratic at heart in all the vital habits of her thought in all the intimate relationships 
 of her people that spoke their natural instinct their habitual attitude towards life 
 The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure long as it had stood and 
 terrible as was the reality of its power was not in fact Russian in origin character or 
 purpose and now it has been shaken off and the great generous Russian people have been 
 added in all their naïve majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the 
 world for justice and for peace Here is a fit partner for a League of Honor 
 One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and 
 could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our 
 unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal 
 intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel our peace within and 
 without our industries and our commerce Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here 
 even before the war began and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to 
 disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the 
 instigation wit the support and even under the personal direction of official agents of the 
 Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States 
 Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most 
 generous interpretation possible upon them because we know that their source lay not in any 
 hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us who were no doubt as ignorant 
 of them as we ourselves were but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what 
 it pleased and told its people nothing But they have played their part in serving to convince 
 us at last that that Government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against 
 our peace and security at its convenience That it means to stir up enemies against us at our 
 very doors that intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence 
 We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a 
 government following such methods we can never have a friend and that in the presence of 
 its organized power always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can 
 be no assured security of the democratic governments of the world We are now about to 
 accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the 
 whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power 
 We are glad now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them to fight thus 
 for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the German peoples 
 included for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to 
 choose their way of life and of obedience The world must be made safe for democracy Its 
 peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty We have no selfish 
 ends to serve 
 We desire no conquest no dominion We seek no indemnities for ourselves no material 
 compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make We are but one of the champions of 
 the rights of mankind We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as 
 the faith and the freedom of nations can make them 
 Just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seeking nothing for ourselves 
 but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples we shall I feel confident conduct our 
 operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the 
 principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany 
 because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor 
 The Austro Hungarian Government has indeed avowed its unqualified endorsement and 
 acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by 
 the Imperial German Government and it has therefore not been possible for this Government 
 to receive Count Tarnowski the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by the 
 Imperial and Royal Government of Austria Hungary but that Government has not actually 
 engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas and I take the liberty 
 for the present at least of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at 
 Vienna 
 We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means 
 of defending our rights 
 It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and 
 fairness because we act without animus not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to 
 bring any injury or disadvantage upon them but only armed opposition to an irresponsible 
 government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running 
 amuck 
 We are let me say again the sincere friends of the German people and shall desire nothing 
 so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us 
 however hard it may be for them for the time being to believe that this is spoken from our 
 hearts 
 We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that 
 friendship exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been 
 impossible 
 We shall happily still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and 
 actions towards the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who 
 live amongst us and share our life and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in 
 fact loyal to their neighbors and to the Government in the hour of test They are most of 
 them as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance 
 They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a 
 different mind and purpose If there should be disloyalty it will be dealt with a firm hand of 
  
  
 
                                
               
               
                
       
 stern repression but if it lifts its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without 
 countenance except from a lawless and malignant few 
 It is a distressing and oppressive duty Gentlemen of the Congress which I have performed in 
 thus addressing you There are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of 
 us It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and 
 disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance 
 But the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have 
 always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to 
 authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small 
 nations for a universal dominion of   concert of free peoples as shall bring 
 peace and safety to all nations and make the world at last free 
 To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and

46,Robert La Follette,Senate Address on Free Speech in War Time Title,1917," 
 
 Mr. President I rise to a question of personal privilege 
 I have no intention of taking the time of the Senate with a review of the events which led to our entrance into 
 the war except in so far as they bear upon the question of personal privilege to which I am addressing 
 myself 
 Six Members of the Senate and 50 Members of the House voted against the declaration of war Immediately 
 there was let loose upon those Senators and Representatives a flood of invective and abuse from 
 newspapers and individuals who had been clamoring for war unequaled I believe in the history of civilized 
 society 
 Prior to the declaration of war every man who had ventured to oppose our entrance into it had been 
 condemned as a coward or worse and even the President   been immune from these 
 attacks 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 Since the declaration of war the triumphant war press has pursued those Senators and Representations 
 who voted against war with malicious falsehood and recklessly libelous attacks going to the extreme limit of 
 charging them with treason against their country 
 This campaign of libel and character assassination directed against the Members of Congress who opposed 
 our entrance into the war has been continued down to the present hour and I have upon my desk 
 newspaper clippings some of them libels upon me alone some directed as well against other Senators who 
 voted in opposition to the declaration of war 
 One of these newspaper reports most widely circulated represents a Federal judge in the State of Texas as 
 saying in a charge to a grand jury I read the article as it appeared in the newspaper and the headline with 
 which it is introduced 
 DISTRICT JUDGE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE SHOT AT TRAITORS IN CONGRESS 
 By Associated Press leased wire 
 Houston Texas October 1,1917 
 Judge Waller T. Burns of the United States district court in charging a Federal grand jury at the beginning 
 of the October term today after   STONE of Missouri HARDWICK of Georgia 
 VARDAMAN of Mississippi GRONNA of North Dakota GORE of Oklahoma and LAFOLLETTE of 
 Wisconsin said 
 If I had a wish I would wish that you men had jurisdiction to return bills of indictment against these 
 men They ought to be tried promptly and fairly and I believe this court could administer the law 
 fairly but I have a conviction as strong as life that this country should stand them up against an 
 adobe wall tomorrow and give them what they deserve If any man deserves death it is a traitor I 
 wish that I could pay for the ammunition I would like to attend the execution and if I were in the 
 firing squad I would not want to be the marksman who had the blank shell 
 The above clipping Mr. President was sent to   judge who wrote upon the margin of 
 the clipping that it occurred to him that the conduct of this judge might very properly be the subject of 
 investigation He enclosed with the clipping a letter from which I quote the following 
 I have been greatly   and unjust attacks that great business interests have 
 organized against you It is a time when all the spirits of evil are turned loose The Kaisers of high 
 finance who have been developing hatred of you for a generation because you have fought against 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 them and for the common good see this opportunity to turn the war patriotism into an engine of 
 attack They are using it everywhere and it is a day when lovers of democracy not only in the 
 world but here in the United States need to go apart on the mountain and spend the night in fasting 
 and prayer I still have faith that the forces of good on this earth will be found to be greater than the 
 forces of evil but we all need resolution I hope you will have the grace to keep your center of 
 gravity on the inside of you and to keep a spirit that is  is a time for the 
 words with malice toward none and charity for all It is the office of great service to be a shield to 
 the good man 's character against malice Before this fight is over you will have a new revelation that 
 such a shield is yours 
 If this newspaper clipping were a single or exceptional instance of lawless defamation I should not trouble 
 the Senate with a reference to it But Mr. President it is not 
 In this mass of newspaper clippings which I have here upon my desk and which I shall not trouble the 
 Senate to read unless it is desired and which represent but a small part of the accumulation clipped from 
 the daily press of the country in the last three months I find other Senators as well as myself accused of 
 the highest crimes of which any man can be guilty --treason and disloyalty and sir accused not only with 
 no evidence to support the accusation but without the suggestion that such evidence anywhere exists It is 
 not claimed that Senators who opposed the declaration of war have since that time acted with any 
 concerted purpose either regarding war measured or any others They have voted according to their 
 individual opinions have often been opposed to each other on bills which have come before the Senate 
 since the declaration of war and according to my recollection have never all voted together since that time 
 upon any single proposition upon which the Senate has been divided  
 I am aware Mr. President that in pursuance of this general campaign of vilification and attempted 
 intimidation requests from various individuals and certain organizations have been submitted to the Senate 
 for my expulsion from this body and that such requests have been referred to and   the 
 committees of the Senate 
 If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks I should not take one moment of the Senate 's time for 
 their consideration and I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and unfairly assailed as I 
 have been hold the same attitude upon this that I do Neither the clamor of the mob nor the voice of power 
 will ever turn   of a hair from the course I mark out for myself  
 as I can obtain and controlled and   conviction of right and duty 
 But sir it is not alone Members of Congress that the war party in this country has sought to intimidate The 
 mandate seems to have gone forth to the sovereign people of this country that they must be silent while 
 those things are being   which most vitally concern their well being their 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 happiness and their lives Today and for weeks past honest and law abiding citizens of this country are 
 being terrorized and outraged in their   to uphold the laws and protect the rights of the 
 people I have in my possession numerous affidavits establishing the fact that people are being unlawfully 
 arrested thrown into jail held incommunicado for days only to be eventually discharged without ever 
 having been taken into court because they have committed no crime Private residences are being invaded 
 loyal citizens of undoubted integrity and probity arrested cross examined and the most sacred 
 constitutional rights guaranteed to every American citizen are being violated 
 It appears to be the purpose of those conducting this campaign to throw the country into a state of terror to 
 coerce public opinion to stifle criticism and suppress discussion of the great issues involved in this war 
 I think all men recognize that in time of war the citizen must surrender some rights for the common good 
 which he is entitled to enjoy in time of peace But sir the right to control their own Government according to 
 constitutional forms is not one of the rights that the citizens of this country are called upon to surrender in 
 time of war 
 Rather in time of war the citizen must be more alert to the preservation of his right to control his 
 Government He must be most watchful of the encroachment of the military upon the civil power He must 
 beware of those precedents in support of arbitrary which excused on the 
 plea of necessity in war time become the fixed rule when the necessity has passed and normal conditions 
 have been restored 
 More than all the citizen and his representative in Congress in time of war must maintain his right of free 
 speech More than in time of war must maintain his right of free speech More than in times of peace it is 
 necessary that the channels for free public discussion of governmental policies shall be open and 
 unclogged I believe Mr. President that I am now touching upon the most important question in this country 
 today and that is the right of the citizens of this country and their representatives in Congress to discuss in 
 an orderly way frankly and publicly and without fear from the platform and through the press every 
 important phase of this war its causes the manner in which it should be conducted and the terms upon 
 which peace should be made The belief which is becoming wide spread in this land that this most 
 fundamental right is being denied to the citizens of this country is a fact the tremendous significance of 
 which those in authority have not yet begun to appreciate I am contending Mr. President for the great 
 fundamental right of the sovereign people of this country to make their voice heard and have that voice 
 heeded upon the great questions arising out of this war including not only how the war shall be prosecuted 
 but the conditions upon which it may be terminated with a due regard for the rights and the honor of this 
 Nation and the interests of humanity 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 I am contending for this right because the exercise of it is necessary to the welfare to the existence of this 
 Government to the successful conduct of this war and to a peace which shall be enduring and for the best 
 interest of this country 
 Suppose success attends the attempt to stifle all discussion of the issues of this war all discussion of the 
 terms upon which it should be concluded all discussion of the objects and purposes to be accomplished by 
 it and concede the demand of the war mad press and war extremists that they monopolize the right of 
 public utterance upon these questions unchallenged what think you would be the consequences to this 
 country not only during the war but after the war 
 RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DISCUSS WAR ISSUES 
 Mr. President our Government above all others is founded on the right of the people freely to discuss all 
 matters pertaining to their Government in war not less than in peace for in this Government the people are 
 the rulers in war no less than in peace It is true sir that Members of the House of Representatives are 
 elected for two years the President for four years and the Members of the Senate for six years and during 
 their temporary official terms these officers constitute what is called the Government But back of them 
 always is the controlling sovereign power of the people and when the people can make their will known the 
 faithful officer will obey that will Though the right of the people to express their   suspended 
 during the term of office of the elected official nevertheless the duty of the official to obey the popular will 
 continues throughout this entire term of office How can that popular will express itself between elections 
   petitions   the representatives of 
 the people Any man who seeks to set a limit upon those rights whether in war or peace aims a blow at the 
 most vital part of our Government And then as the time for election approaches and the official is called to 
 account for his stewardship not a day not a week not a month before the election but a year or more 
 before it if the people choose they must have the right to the freest possible discussion of every question 
 upon which their representative has acted of the merits of every measure he has supported or opposed of 
 every vote he has cast and every speech that he has made And before this great fundamental right every 
 other must if necessary give way for in no other manner can representative government be preserved 
 Mr. President what I am saying has been exemplified in the lives and public discussion of the ablest 
 statesman of this country whose memories we most revere and whose deeds we most justly 
 commemorate I shall presently ask the attention of the Senate to the views of some of these men upon the 
 subject we are now considering 
 Closely related to this subject of the right of the citizen to discuss war is that of the constitutional power and 
 duty of the Congress to declare the purposes and objects of any war in which our country may be engaged 
 The authorities which I shall cite cover both the right of the people to discuss the war in all its phases and 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 the right and the duty of the people 's representatives in Congress to declare the purposes and objects of the 
 war For the sake of brevity I shall present these quotations together at this point instead of submitting them 
 separately 
 DISCUSSION BY AMERICAN STATESMEN 
 Henry Clay in a memorable address at Lexington Kentucky on the 13th day of November 1847 during 
 the Mexican War took a strong position in behalf of the right of the people to freely discuss every question 
 relating to the war even though the discussion involved a strong condemnation of the war policy of the 
 Executive He also declared it to be not only the right but the duty of the Congress to declare the objects of 
 the war AS a part of that address he presented certain resolutions embodying his views on these subjects 
 These resolutions were adopted at that   present and were adopted at many other 
 mass meetings throughout the country during the continuance of the Mexican War 
 For introducing in this body some time ago a resolution asserting the right of Congress to declare the 
 purposes of the present war I have as the newspaper clippings here will show been denounced as a traitor 
 and my conduct characterized as treasonable 
 As bearing directly upon the conduct for which I have been so criticized and condemned I invite your 
 attention to the language of Henry Clay in the address I have mentioned 
 He said 
 But the havoc of war is in progress and the no less deplorable havoc of an inhospitable and 
 pestilential climate Without indulging in an unnecessary retrospect and useless reproaches on the 
 past all hearts and heads should unite in the patriotic endeavor to bring it to a satisfactory close Is 
 there no way that this can be done Must we blindly continue the conflict without any visible object 
 or any prospect of a definite termination This is the important subject upon which I desire to 
 consult and to commune with you Who in this free Government is to decide upon the objects of a 
 war at its commencement of at any time during its existence Does the power belong to collective 
 wisdom of the Nation in congress assembled or is it vested solely in a single functionary of the 
 Government 
 A declaration of war is the highest and most awful exercise of sovereignty The convention which 
 framed our Federal constitution had learned from the pages of history that it had been often and 
 greatly abused 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 It had seen that war had often been commenced upon the most trifling pretexts that it had been 
 frequently waged to establish or exclude a dynasty to snatch a crown from the head of one 
 potentate and place it upon the head of another that it had often been prosecuted to promote alien 
 and other interests than those of the nation whose chief had proclaimed it as in the case of English 
 wars for Hanoverian interests and in short that such a vast and tremendous power ought not to be 
 confined to the perilous exercise of one single man The convention therefore resolved to guard the 
 war making power against those great abuses of which in the hands of a monarch it was so 
 susceptible And the security against those abuses which its wisdom devised was to vest the war- 
 making power in the congress of the united States being the immediate representatives of the 
 people and the States So apprehensive and jealous was the convention of its abuse in any State in 
 the Union without the consent of Congress Congress then in our system of government is the sole 
 depository of that tremendous power 
 Mr. President it is impossible for me to quote as extensively from this address as I should like to do and still 
 keep within the compass of the time that I have set down for myself but the whole of the address is 
 accessible to every Senator here together with all of the discussion which followed it over the country and 
 in these times it would seem to me worthy of the review of Senators and of newspaper editors and of those 
 who have duties to discharge in connection with this great crisis that is upon the world 
 I quote further 
 The Constitution provides that Congress shall have power to declare war and grant letters of 
 marque and reprisal to make rules concerning captures on land and water to raise and support 
 armies and provide and maintain a navy and to make rules for the government of the land and 
 naval forces Thus we perceive that the principal power in regard to war with all its auxiliary 
 attendants is granted to Congress Whenever called upon to determine upon the solemn question 
 of peace or war Congress must consider and deliberate and decide upon the motives objects and 
 causes of the war 
 If that be true is it treason for a Senator upon this floor to offer a resolution dealing with that question 
 I quote further from Mr. Clay 
 And if a war be commenced without any previous declaration of its objects as in the case of the 
 existing war with Mexico Congress must necessarily possess the authority at any time to declare 
 for what purposes it shall be further prosecuted If we suppose Congress does not possess the 
 controlling authority attributed to it if it be contended that a war having been once commenced the 
 President of the United States may direct it to the accomplishment of any object he pleases without 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 consulting and without any regard to the will of Congress the convention will have utterly failed in 
 guarding the Nation against the abuses and ambition of a single individual Either Congress or the 
 President possess if and may prosecute it for objects against the will of Congress where is the 
 difference between our free Government and that of any other nation which may be governed by an 
 absolute Czar Emperor or King 
 In closing his address Mr. Clay said 
 I conclude therefore Mr. President and fellow citizens with entire confidence that congress has 
 the right either at the beginning or during the prosecution of any war to decide the objects and 
 purposes for which it was proclaimed or for which it ought to be continued And I think it is the duty 
 of  and authentic act to declare for what objects the present war shall 
 be longer prosecuted I suppose the President would not hesitate to regulate his conduct by the 
 pronounced will of congress and to employ the force and the diplomatic power of the Nation to 
 execute that will But is the President should decline or refuse to do so and in contempt of the 
 supreme authority of congress should persevere in waging the war for other objects than those 
  it would be the imperative duty of that body to vindicate its authority 
 by the most stringent and effectual and appropriate measures And it on the contrary the enemy 
 should refuse to conclude a treaty containing stipulations securing the objects designated by 
 Congress it would become the duty of the whole Government to prosecute the war with all the 
 national energy until those objects were   of peace There can be no insuperable 
 difficulty in Congress making such an authoritative declaration Let it resolve simply that the war 
 shall or shall not be a war of conquest and if a war of conquest what is to be conquered should a 
 resolution pass disclaiming the design of conquest peace would follow in less than 60 days if the 
 President would conform to his constitutional duty 
 Mr. Clay as a part of that speech presented certain resolutions which were unanimously adopted by the 
 meeting and which declared that the power to determine the purposes of the war rested with Congress and 
 then proceeded clearly to state the purposes and the only purposes for which the war should be 
 prosecuted 
 The last one of these resolutions is so pertinent to the present discussion that I invite your attention to it at 
 this time It is as follows 
 Resolved That we invite our fellow citizens of the United States who are anxious for the restoration 
 of the blessings of peace or it the existing war shall continue to be prosecuted are desirous that its 
 purposes and objects shall be defined and know who are anxious to avert present and future perils 
 and dangers with which it may be fraught and who are also anxious to produce contentment and 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            
 satisfaction at home and to elevate the national character abroad to assemble together in their 
 respective communities and to express their views feelings and opinions 
 Abraham Lincoln was a Member of congress at the time of the Mexican War He strongly opposed the war 
 while it was in progress and severely criticized President Polk on the floor of the House because he did not 
 state in his message when peace might be expected In the course of his speech Lincoln said 
 At its beginning Gen. Scott   President driven into disfavor if not disgrace for 
 intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months But now at the end 
 of 20 months this same President gives a long message without showing us that as to the end 
 he himself has even an imaginary conception AS I have said he knows not where he is He is a 
 bewildered confounded and miserably perplexed man God grant he may be able to show there is 
 not something about his conscience more painful than his mental perplexity 
 Writing to a friend who had objected to his opposition to Polk in relation to this power of the President in war 
 Lincoln said 
 The provision of the constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated as I 
 understand  reasons Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their 
 people in wars pretending generally if not always that the good of the people was the object This 
 our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions and they resolved to 
 so frame the constitution that no man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us 
 But your view destroys the whole matter and places our President where kings have always stood 
 I now quote from the speech of Charles Sumner delivered at Tremont Temple Boston November 5 1846 
 John A. Andrew who was the great war governor of Massachusetts as I remember presided at this public 
 meeting which was in support of the independent nomination of Dr. I.G. Howe as Representative in 
 Congress Mr. Sumner was  Francis Adams who also delivered an address at this 
 meeting This is the view of Mr. Sumner on the Mexican War which was then in progress as expressed by 
 him on this occasion 
 The Mexican War is an enormity born of slavery Base in object atrocious in beginning 
 immoral in all its influences vainly prodigal of treasure and life it is a war of infamy which must blot 
 the pages of our history 
 In closing his eloquent and powerful address he said 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            0 
 Even if we seem to fail in this election we shall not fail in reality The influence of this effort will help 
 to awaken and organize that powerful public   war will at last be arrested Hand 
 out fellow citizens the white banner of peace let the citizens of Boston rally about it and may it be 
 borne conscientious people aroused to condemnation of this 
 murderous war until Mexico now wet with blood unjustly shed shall repose undisturbed beneath its 
 folds 
 Contrast this position   at Tremont Temple with that of the Secretary of the 
 Treasury Mr. McAdoo He is now touring the country with all the prestige of his great financial mission and 
 the authority of his great financial mission and the authority of his high place in the administration I quote 
 the language of the authorized report of his speech before the Bankers Association of West Virginia 
 September 21 1917 According to daily press reports he is making substantially the same denunciation in 
 all his addresses 
 America intends that those well meaning but misguided people who talk inopportunity of peace 
 when there can be no peace until the cancer which has rotted civilization in Europe is extinguished 
 and destroyed forever shall be silenced I want to say here and now and with due deliberation that 
 every pacifist speech in this country made at this inopportune and improper time is in effect 
 traitorous 
 In these times we had better turn the marble bust of Charles Sumner to the wall It ill becomes those who 
 tamely surrender the right of free speech to look upon that strong noble patriotic face 
 Mr. President Daniel Webster then in the zenith of his power and with the experience and knowledge of 
 his long life and great public service in many capacities to add weight to his words spoke at Faneuil Hall 
 November 6 1846 in opposition to the Mexican War He said 
 Mr. Chairman I wish to speak with all soberness in this respect and I would say nothing here 
 tonight which I would not say in my place in Congress or before the whole world The question now 
 is For what purposes and to what ends is this present war to be prosecuted 
 What will you say to the stature of the statesmanship that imputes treason to his country to a Member of this 
 body who introduces a resolution having no other import than that 
 Webster saw no reason why the purposes of the war in which his country was engaged should not be 
 discussed in Congress or out of 's representatives   themselves 
 After referring to Mexico as a weak and distracted country he proceeded 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            1 
 It is time for us to know what are the objects and designs of our Government It is not the habit of 
 the American people nor natural to their character to consider the expense of a war which they 
 deem just and necessary Not only just but necessary but it is their habit and belongs to their 
 character to inquire into the justice and necessity of a war in which it is proposed to involve them 
 Mr. Webster discussed the Mexican War at Springfield Mass. September 29 1847 and again while the 
 war was in progress he did not hesitate to express his disapproval in plain language 
 Many battles had been fought and won and our victorious armies were in the field on foreign soil 
 Sir free speech had not been suppressed The right of the people to assemble and to state their grievances 
 was still an attribute of American freedom Mr. Webster said We are in my opinion in a most unnecessary 
 and therefore a most unjustifiable war 
 Whoever expects to whip men free men in this country into a position where they are to be denied the right 
 to exercise the same freedom of speech and discussion that Webster exercised in that speech little 
 understand the value which the average citizen of this country places upon the liberty guaranteed to him by 
 the Constitution Sir until the sacrifices of every battle field consecrated to the establishment of 
 representative government and of constitutional freedom shall be obliterated from the pages of history and 
 forgotten of men the plain citizenship of this country will jealously guard that liberty and that freedom and 
 will not surrender it 
 To return to my text Mr. Webster said 
 We are in my opinion in a most unnecessary and therefore a most unjustifiable war I hope we are 
 nearing the close of it I attend carefully and anxiously to every rumor and every breeze that brings 
 to us any report that the effusion of blood caused in my  and unjustifiable 
 proceeding on the part of the Government may cease 
 He makes the charge that the war was begun under false pretexts as follows 
 Now sir the law of nations instructs us that there are wars of pretexts The history of the world 
 proves that there have been and we are not now without proof that there are wars waged on 
 pretexts that is on pretenses where the cause assigned is not the true cause That I believe on my 
 conscience is the true character of the war now waged against Mexico IF believe it to be a war of 
 pretexts a war in which the true motive is not distinctly avowed but in which pretenses 
 afterthoughts evasions and other method are employed to put a case before the community which 
 is not the true case

 Think you Mr. Webster was not within his constitutional rights in thus criticizing the character of the war its 
 origin and the reasons which were given from time to time in justification of it 
 Mr. Webster discusses at length what he considers some of the false pretexts of the war Later on he says 
 Sir men there are whom we see and whom we hear speak of the duty of extending our free 
 institutions over the whole world if possible We owe it to benevolence they think to confer the 
 blessings we enjoy on every other people But while I trust that liberty and free civil institutions as 
 we have experienced them may ultimately spread over the globe I   sure that all 
 people are fit for them nor am I desirous of imposing or forcing our peculiar forms upon any nation 
 that does not wish to embrace them 
 Taking up the subject that war does now exist Mr. Webster asks 
 What is our duty I say for one that I suppose it to be true I hope it to be true that a majority of 
 the next House of Representatives will be Whigs will be opposed to the war I think we have heard 
 from the East and the West the North and the South some things that make that pretty clear 
 Suppose it to be so What then Well sir I say for one and at once that unless the President of the 
 United States shall make out a case which shall show to congress that the aim and object for which 
 the war is now prosecuted is no purpose not connected with the safety of the Union and the just 
 rights of the American people then Congress ought to pass resolutions against the prosecution of 
 the war and grant no further supplies I would speak here with caution and all just limitation It must 
 be admitted to be the clear intent of the constitution that no foreign war would exist without the 
 assent of Congress This was meant as a restraint on the Executive power But if when a war has 
 once begun the President may continue it as long as he pleases free of all control of Congress 
 then it is clear that the war power is substantially in his own single hand Nothing will be done by a 
 wise Congress hastily or rashly nothing that partakes of the nature of violence or recklessness a 
 high and delicate regard must of course be had for the honor and credit of the Nation but after all 
 if the war should become odious to the people if they shall disapprove the objects for which it 
 appears to be prosecuted then it will be the bounden duty of their Representatives in Congress to 
 demand of the President a full statement of his objects and purposes And if these purposes shall 
 appear to them not to be founded in the public good or not consistent with the honor and character 
 of the country then it will be their duty to put an end to   of their constitutional 
 authority 
 If this be not so then the whole balance of the Constitution is overthrown and all just restraint on 
 the Executive power in a matter of the highest concern to the peace and happiness of the country 
 is over thrown and all just restraint on the Executive power in a matter of the highest concern to 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            3 
 the peace and happiness of the country entirely destroyed If we do not maintain this doctrine if it is 
 not so if Congress in whom the war making power is expressly made to reside is to have no 
 voice in the declaration or continuance or war if it is not to judge of the propriety of beginning or 
 carrying it on then we depart at once and broadly from the Constitution 
 Mr. Webster concluded his speech in these memorable words 
 We may be tossed upon an ocean where we can see no land nor perhaps the sun or stars But 
 there is a chart and a compass for us to study to consult and to obey That chart is the Constitution 
 of the country That compass is an honest single eyed purpose to preserve the institutions and the 
 liberty with which God has blessed us 
 In 1847 Senator Tom Corwin made a memorable speech in the Senate on the Mexican War It was one of 
 the ablest addresses   able statesman and one of the great contributions to the discussion 
 of the subject we are now considering At the time of Senator Corwin 's address the majority in Congress 
 were supporting the President The people up to that time had had no chance to express their views at an 
 election After referring to the doctrine then   faction of the Senate that after war is 
 declared it must be prosecuted to the bitter end as the President may direct until one side of the other is 
 hopelessly beaten and with one man the President in sole command of the 
 destinies of the Nation MR Corwin said 
 With these doctrines for our guide I will thank any Senator to furnish me with any means of 
 escaping from the prosecution of this or any other war for an hundred years to come if it please the 
 President who shall be to continue it so long Tell me ye who contend that being in war duty 
 demands of Congress for its prosecution all the money and every able bodied man in America to 
 carry it on if need be who also contend that it is the right of the President without the control of 
 Congress to march your embodied hosts to Monterey to Yucatan to Mexico to Panama to China 
 and that under penalty of death to the officer who disobeys him tell me I demand it of you tell 
 me tell the American people tell the nations of Christendom what is the difference between your 
 democracy and the most odious most hateful despotism that a merciful God has ever allowed a 
 nation to be afflicted with since government on earth began You may call this free government but 
 it is such freedom and no other as of old was established at Babylon at Susa at Bactrina or 
 Persepolis Its parallel is scarcely to be found when thus falsely understood in any even the worst 
 forms of civil polity in modern times Sir it is not so such is not your Constitution it is something 
 else something other and better than this

 Lincoln Webster Clay Sumner what a galaxy of names in American history They all believed and 
 asserted and advocated in the midst of war that it was the right the constitutional right and the patriotic 
 duty of American citizens after the declaration of war and while the war was in progress to discuss the 
 issued of the war and to criticize the policies employed in its prosecution and to work for the election of 
 representatives opposed to prolonging war 
 The right of Lincoln Webster Clay Sumner to oppose the Mexican War criticize its conduct advocate its 
 conclusion on a just basis is exactly the same right and privilege as that possessed by every 
 Representative in Congress   every American citizen in our land today in respect to the war 
 in which we are now engaged Their arguments as to the power of Congress to shape the war policy and 
 their opposition to what they believed to be the usurpation of power on the part of the Executive are potent 
 so long as the Constitution remains the law of the land 
 English history like our own shows that it has ever been the right of the citizen to criticize and when he 
 thought necessary to condemn the war policy of his Government 
 DISCUSSION BY ENGLISH STATESMEN 
 John Bright consistently fought the Crimean War with all the power of his great personality and noble mind 
 he fought it    the floor of the English Parliament After his death Gladstone 
 although he had been a part of the ministry that Bright had opposed because of the Crimean War selected 
 this as the theme for his eulogy of the great statesman as best portraying his high character and great 
 service to the English people 
 Lloyd George aggressively opposed the Boer War Speaking in the House of Commons July 25 1900 in 
 reply to the prime minister he said 
 He has led us into two blunders The first was the war But worse than the war is the change that 
 has been effected in the purpose for which we are prosecuting the war We went into the war for 
 equal rights we are prosecuting the war We went into the war for equal rights we are prosecuting 
 it for annexation You entered into these two Republics for philanthropic purposes and 
 remained to commit burglary A war of annexation however against a proud people must be a 
 war of extermination and that is unfortunately what it seems we are now committing ourselves to 
 burning homesteads and turning men and women out of their homes 
 I am citing this language Mr. President as showing the length to which statesmen have gone in opposing 
 wars which have been   and the latitude that has been accorded them 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            5 
 The right honorable gentleman has made up his mind that this war shall produce electioneering 
 capital to his own side He is in a great hurry to go to the country before the facts are known He 
 wants to have the judgment of the people in the very height and excitement of the fever He wants a 
 verdict before the pleadings are closed and before discovery has been obtained He does not want 
 the documents to come but he wants to have the judgment of the country upon censured news 
 suppressed dispatches and unpaid bills 
 In a speech delivered October 23 1901 Lloyd George charged that the English Army had burned villages 
 blown up farmhouses swept away the cattle burned thousands of tons of grain destroyed all agricultural 
 implements all the mills the irrigation works and left the territory a blackened devastated wilderness He 
 said 
 In June the death rate among the children in the Orange River Colony camps was at the rate of 192 
 per thousand per annum and in Transvaal 233 per thousand per annum In July the figures were 
 220 and 336 per thousand per annum respectively In August they had risen to 250 and 468 and in 
 September to 442 in Orange River Colony and to 457 in the Transvaal These are truly appalling 
 figures It means that at that rate in two years time there would not be a little child left in the whole 
 of these two new territories The worst of it is that I can not resist the conclusion that their lives 
 could have been saved had it not been that these camps had been deliberately chosen for military 
 purposes In the few camps near the coast there is hardly any mortality at all 
 Observe that here is a criticism of the military policies of his Government 
 and if the children had been removed from the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal to the 
 seacoasts where they could have been easily fed and clothed and cared for their lives might be 
 saved but as long as they were kept up in the north there was a terrible inducement offered to the 
 Boer commanders not to attack the lines of communication If I were to despair for the future of 
 this country it would not be because of trade competition from either American or Germany or the 
 ineffectiveness of its army or anything that might happen to its ships but rather because it used its 
 great hulking strength to torture a little child Had it not been that his ministry had shown distinct 
 symptoms of softening of the brain I would call the torpor and indifference they are showing in face 
 of all this criminal It is a maddening horror and it will haunt the Empire to its dying hour What 
 wonder is it that Europe should mock and hiss at us Let any honest Britisher fearlessly search his 
 heart and answer this question Is there any ground for the reproach flung at  
 world that having failed to crush the men we have now taken to killing babes

 Mr. President while we were struggling for our independence the Duke of Grafton in the House of Lords 
 October 26 1775 speaking against voting thanks to British officers and soldiers after the battles of 
 Lexington and Bunker Hill declared 
 I pledge myself to your lordships and my country that if necessity should require it and my health 
 otherwise permit it I mean to come down to this House in a litter in order to express my full and 
 hearty disapproval of the measures now pursued and as I understand from the noble lords in 
 office meant to be pursued 
 On the same occasion Mr. Fox said 
 I could not consent to the bloody consequences of so silly a contest about so silly an object 
 conducted in the silliest manner than history or observation had ever furnished an instance of and 
 from which we are likely to derive poverty misery disgrace defeat and ruin 
 In the House of Commons May 14 1777 Mr. Burke is reported in the parliamentary debates against the 
 war on the American Colonies as saying he was and ever would be ready to support a just war whether 
 against subjects or alien enemies but where justice or color of justice was wanting he would ever be the 
 first to oppose it 
 Lord Chatham November 18 1777 spoke as follows regarding the war between England and the American 
 Colonies 
 I would sell my shirt off my back to assist in proper measures properly and wisely conducted but I 
 would not part with a single shilling to the present ministers Their plans are founded in destruction 
 and disgrace It is my lords a ruinous and destructive war it is full of danger it teems with disgrace 
 and must end in ruin If I were an American as I am an Englishman while a foreign troop was 
 landed in my country I never would lay down my arms Never Never Never 
 Mr. President I have made these quotations from some of the leading statesmen of England to show that 
 the principle of free speech was no new doctrine born of the Constitution of the United States Our 
 Constitution merely declared the principle It did not create it It is a heritage of English speaking peoples 
 which has been and which they must preserve so long as they hope to live as 
 free men I say without fear of contradiction that there has never been a time for more than a century and a 
 half when the right of free speech and free press and the right of the people to peaceably assemble for 
 public discussion have been so violated among English speaking people as they are violated today 
 throughout the United States Today in the land we have been wo nt to call the free United States 
 governors mayors and policemen are preventing or breaking up peaceable meetings called to discuss the 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            7 
 questions growing out of this war and judges and courts with some notable and worthy exceptions are 
 failing to protect the citizens in their rights 
 It is no answer to say that when the war is over the citizen may once more resume his rights and feel some 
 security in his liberty and his person As I have already tried to point out now is precisely the time when the 
 country needs the counsel of all its citizens In time of war even more than in time of peace whether citizens 
 happen to agree with the ruling administration or not these precious fundamental personal rights free 
 speech free press and right of assemblage so explicitly and emphatically  
 should be maintained inviolable There is no rebellion in the land no martial law no courts are closed no 
 legal processes suspended and there is no threat even of invasion 
 But more than this if every preparation for war can be made the excuse for destroying free speech and a 
 free press and the right of the people to assemble together for peaceful discussion then we may well 
 despair of ever again finding ourselves for a long period in a state of peace With the possessions we 
 already have in remote parts of the world with the obligations we seem almost certain to assume as a result 
 of the present war a war can be made any time overnight and the destruction of personal rights now 
 occurring will be pointed to then as precedents for a still further invasion of the rights of the citizen This is 
 the road which all free governments have heretofore traveled to their destruction and how far we have 
 progressed along it is shown when we compare the standard of liberty of Lincoln Clay and Webster with 
 the standard of the present day  
 This leads me Mr. President to the next thought to which I desire to invite the attention of the Senate and 
 that is the power of Congress to declare the purpose and objects of the war and the failure of Congress to 
 exercise that power in the present crisis 
 POWER OF CONGRESS TO DECLARE OBJECTS OF WAR 
 For the mere assertion of that right in the form of a resolution to be considered and discussed which I 
 introduced August 11 1917 I have been denounced throughout this broad land as a traitor to my country 
 Mr. President we are in a war the awful consequences of which no man can foresee which in my 
 judgment could have been avoided if the Congress had exercised its constitutional power to influence and 
 direct the foreign policy of this country 
 On the 8th day of February 1915 I introduced in the Senate a resolution authorizing the President to invite 
 the representatives of the neutral nations of the world to assemble and consider among other things 
 whether it would not be possible to lay out lanes of travel upon the high seas and through proper negotiation 
 with the belligerent powers have those lanes recognized as neutral territory through which the commerce of 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            8 
 neutral nations might pass This together with other provisions constituted a resolution as I shall always 
 regard it of most vital and supreme importance in the world crisis and one that should have been 
 considered and acted upon by Congress 
 I believe sir that had some such action been taken the history of the world would not be written at this hour 
 in the blood of more than one half of the nations of the earth with the remaining nations in danger of 
 becoming involved 
 I believe that had Congress exercised the power in this respect which I contend it possesses we could and 
 probably would have avoided the present war 
 Mr. President I believe that if we are to extricate ourselves from this war and restore this country to an 
 honorable and lasting peace the Congress must exercise in full the war powers entrusted to it by the 
 Constitution I have already called your attention sufficiently no doubt to the opinions upon this subject 
  the greatest lawyers and statesmen of the country and I now venture to ask your 
 attention to a little closer examination of the subject viewed in the light of distinctly legal authorities and 
 principles 
 CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS INVOLVED 
 Section 8 Article I of the Constitution provides 
 The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the 
 debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States 
 In this first sentence we find that no war can be prosecuted without the consent of the Congress No war 
 can be prosecuted without money There is no power to raise the money for war except the power of 
 Congress From this provision alone it must follow absolutely and without qualification that the duty of 
 determining whether a war shall be prosecuted or not whether the people 's money shall be expended for 
 the purpose of war or not rests upon the Congress and with that power goes necessarily the power to 
 determine the purposes of the war for if the Congress does not approve the purposes of the war it may 
 refuse to lay the tax upon the people to prosecute it 
 Again section 8 further provides that Congress shall have power 
 To declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land 
 and water 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            9 
 To raise and support armies but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term 
 than two years 
 To provide and maintain a Navy 
 To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces 
 To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union suppress insurrection and 
 repel invasion 
 To provide for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as 
 may be employed in the service of the United States reserving to the States respectively the 
 appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline 
 prescribed by Congress 
 In the foregoing grants of power which are as complete as language can make them there is no mention of 
 the President Nothing is omitted from the powers conferred upon the Congress Even the power to make 
 the rules for the government and the regulation of all the national forces both on land and on the sea is 
 vested in the Congress 
 Then not content with this to make certain that no question could possibly arise the framers of the 
 Constitution declared that Congress shall have power 
 To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing 
 powers and all other powers   in the Government of the United States or 
 in any department or officer thereof 
 We all know from the debates which took place in the constitutional convention why it was that the 
 constitution was so framed as to vest in the Congress the entire war making power The framers of the 
 Constitution knew that to give to one man that power meant danger to the rights and liberties of the people 
 They knew that it mattered not whether you call the man king or emperor czar or president to put into his 
 hands the power of making war or peace meant despotism It meant that the people would be called upon to 
 wage wars in which they had no interest or to which they might even be opposed It meant secret diplomacy 
 and secret treaties It meant that in those things most vital to the lives and welfare of the people they would 
 have nothing to say The framers of the constitution believed that they had guarded against this in the 
 language I have quoted They placed the entire control of this subject in the hands of the Congress And it 
 was assumed that debate would be free and open that many men representing all the sections of the 
 country would freely frankly and calmly exchange their views unafraid of the power of the Executive 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            0 
  their own convictions and a desire to obey the will of the people expressed 
 in a constitutional manner 
 Another reason for giving this power to the congress was that the Congress particularly the House of 
 Representatives was assumed to be directly responsible to the people and would most nearly represent 
 their views The term of office for a Representative was fixed at only two years One third of the Senate 
 would be elected each two years It was believed that this close relation to the people would insure a fair 
 representation of the popular will in the action which the Congress might take Moreover if the congress for 
 any reason was unfaithful to its trust and declared a war which the people did not desire to support or to 
 continue they could in two years at most retire from office their unfaithful Representatives and return others 
 who would terminate the war It is true that within two years much harm could be  
 declaration of war especially a war of aggression where men were e sent abroad The framers of the 
 Constitution made no provision for such a condition for they apparently never contemplated that such a 
 condition would arise 
 Moreover under the system of voluntary enlistment which was the only system of raising an army for use 
 outside the country of which the framers of the Constitution had any idea the people could force a 
 settlement of any war to which they were   means of not volunteering to fight it 
 The only power relating to war with which the Executive was entrusted was that of acting as Commander in 
 Chief of the Army and Navy and of the militia when called into actual service This provision is found in 
 section 2 of Article II and is as follows 
 The President shall be commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the 
 militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States 
 Here is found the sum total of the President 's war powers After the Army is raised he becomes the General 
 in Command His function is purely military He is the General in Command of the entire Army just as there 
 is a general in command of a certain field of operation The authority of each is confined strictly to the field 
 of military service The Congress must raise and support and equip and maintain the Army which the 
 President is to command Until the Army is raised the President has no military authority over any of the 
 persons that may compose it He can not enlist a man or provide a uniform or a single gun or pound of 
 powder The country may be invaded from all sides and except for the command of the Regular Army the 
 President as Commander in Chief of the Army is as powerless as any citizen to stem the tide of the 
 invasion In such case his only resort would be to the militia as provided in the Constitution Thus 
 completely did the fathers of the Constitution strip the Executive of military power 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            1 
 It may be said that the duty of the President to enforce the laws of the country carries with it by implication 
 control over the military forces for that purpose and that the decision as to when the laws are violated and 
 the manner in which they should be redressed rests with the President This whole matter was considered 
 in the famous case of Ex parte Milligan 4 Wall 2 The question of enforcing the laws of the United States 
 however does not arise in the present discussion The laws of the United States have no effect outside the 
 territory of the United States Our Army in France or our Navy on the high seas may be engaged in worthy 
 enterprises but they are not enforcing the laws of the United States and the President derives from his 
 constitutional obligation to enforce the laws of the country no power to determine the purposes of the 
 present war 
 
 The only remaining provision of the Constitution to be considered on the subject is that provision of Article II 
 section 2 which provides that the President 
 Shall have no   the consent of the Senate to make treaties providing two thirds of 
 the Senate present concur 
 This is the same section of the Constitution which provides that the President Shall nominate and by and 
 with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers consuls 
 judges of the Supreme Court and so forth 
 Observe the President under this constitutional provision gets no authority to declare the purposes and 
 objects of any war in which the country may be engaged It is true that a treaty of peace can not be 
 executed except the President and the Senate concur in its execution If a President should refuse to agree 
 to terms of peace which were proposed for  of Congress and accepted by the 
 parliament of an enemy nation against the will we will say of an emperor the war would simply stop if the 
 two parliaments agreed and exercised their powers respectively to withhold supplies and the formal 
 execution of a treaty of peace would be postponed until the people could select another President It is 
 devoutly to be hoped that such a situation will never arise and it is hardly conceivable that it should arise 
 with both an Executive and a Senate anxious respectively to discharge the constitutional duties of their 
 office But if it should arise under the Constitution the final authority and the power to ultimately control is 
  The President can no more make a treaty of peace without the 
 approval not only of the Senate but of two thirds of the Senators present than he can appoint a judge of the 
 Supreme Court without the concurrence of the Senate A decent regard for the duties of the President as 
 well as the duties of the Senators and the consideration of the interests of the people whose servants both 
 the Senators and the President are requires that the negotiations which lead up to the making of peace 
 should be participated in    for Senators to take any other 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            2 
 position is to shirk a plain duty is to avoid an obligation imposed upon   and letter of the 
 Constitution   oath of office each has taken 
 PRECEDENTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 As might be expected from the plain language of the Constitution the precedents and authorities are all one 
 way I shall not attempt to present them all here but only refer to those which have peculiar application to 
 the present situation 
 Watson in his work on the Constitution Volume II page 915 says 
 The authority of the President over the Army and Navy to command and control is only subject to 
 the restrictions of Congress to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval 
 forces Neither can impair or invade the authority of the other  
 The powers of the President under the war clause are only those which may be called military 
 The same author on the same and succeeding page points out that the President as Commander in Chief of 
 the Army may direct the military force in such a way as to most effectively injure the enemy 
 He may even direct an invasion of enemy territory But says the author this can be done temporarily 
 however only until Congress has defined what the permanent policy of the country is to be 
 How then can the President declare the purposes of the war to be to extend permanently the territory of 
 an ally or secure for an ally damages either in the form of money or new territory 
 Pomeroy in his Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States 9th edition 1886 p. 373 says 
 The organic law nowhere prescribes or limits the causes for which hostilities may be waged against 
 a foreign country The causes of war it leaves to the discretion and judgment of the legislature 
 In other words it is for Congress to determine what we are fighting for The President as Commander in 
 Chief of the Army is to determine the best method of carrying on the fight But since the purposes of the war 
 must determine what are the best methods of conducting it the primary duty at all times rests upon 
 Congress to declare either in the declaration of war or subsequently what the objects are which it is 
 expected to  
 In Elliot 's Debates supplement 2d edition 1866 p. 439 vol 5 it is said

 There is a material difference between the cases of making war and making peace It should be 
 more easy to get out of war than into it 
 In the same volume at page 140 we find 
 Mr. Sherman said he considered the executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for 
 carrying the will of the legislature into effect 
 Story in his work on the Constitution 5th edition 1891 p.92 says 
 The history of republics has but too fatally proved that they are too ambitious of military fame and 
 conquest and too easily devoted to the interests of demagogues who flatter their pride and betray 
 their interests It should therefore be difficult in a republic to declare war but not to make peace 
 The representatives of the people are to lay the taxes to support a war and therefore have aright to 
 be consulted as to its propriety and necessity 
 I commend this language to those gentlemen both in and out of public office who condemn as treasonable 
 all efforts    in Congress to discuss terms of peace or who 
 even venture to suggest that a peace is not desirable until such time as the President acting solely on his 
 own responsibility shall declare for peace It is a strange doctrine we hear these days that the mass of the 
 people who pay in money misery and blood all the costs of this war out of which a favored few profit so 
 largely may not freely and publicly discuss terms of peace I believe that I have shown that such an odious 
 and tyrannical doctrine has never been   who have stood for liberty and representative 
 government in this country 
 Ordronaux in his work on Constitutional Legislation says 
 This power the war making power the Constitution has lodged in Congress as the political 
 department of the Government and more immediate representative of the will of the people P. 
 495 
 On page 496 the same author points out that 
 The general power to declare war and the consequent right to conduct it as long as the public 
 interests may seem to require  
 is vested in Congress 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            4 
 The right to determine when and upon what terms the public interests require that war shall cease must 
 therefore necessarily vest in Congress 
 I have already referred to the fact that Lincoln Webster Clay Sumner Corwin and others all contended 
 and declared in the midst of war that it was the right the constitutional right and the patriotic duty of 
 American citizens after the declaration of war as well as before the declaration of war and while the war 
 was in progress to discuss the issues of the war to criticize the policies employed in its prosecution and to 
 work for the election of representatives pledged to carry out the will of the people respecting the war 
 Let me call your attention to what James Madison who became the fourth President of the United States 
 said on the subject in a speech at the constitutional convention June 29 1787 
 A standing military force with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty 
 The means of defense against foreign dangers have always been the instrument of tyranny at 
 home Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite war whenever a revolt was 
 apprehended Throughout all Europe the armies kept up under the pretense of defending have 
 enslaved the people It is perhaps questionable whether the best concerted system of absolute 
 power in Europe could maintain itself in a situation where no alarms of external danger could tame 
 the people to the domestic yoke 
 I now invite your attention to some of the precedents   that it has exercised 
 almost from the time of the first Congress substantially the powers I am urging it should assert now 
 CONGRESSIONAL PRECEDENTS 
 Many of the precedents to which I shall now briefly refer will be found in Hinds Precedents volume 2 
 chapter 49 My authority for the others are the records of Congress itself as contained in the Congressional 
 Globe and Congressional Record 
 In 1811 the House originated and the Senate agreed to a resolution as follows 
 Taking into view the present state of the world the peculiar situation of Spain and of her American 
 Provinces and the intimate relations of the territory eastward of the River Perdido adjoining the 
 United States to their security and tranquility Therefore 
 Resolved etc That the United States can not see with indifference any part of the Spanish 
 Provinces adjoining the said States eastward of the River Perdido pass from the hands of Spain into 
 those of any other foreign power 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            5 
 In 1821 Mr. Clay introduced the following resolution which passed the House 
 Resolved That the House of Representatives participates with the people of the United States in 
 the deep interest which they feel for the success of the Spanish Provinces of South America which 
 are struggling to establish their liberty and independence and that it will give its constitutional 
 support to the President of the United States whenever he may deem it expedient to recognize the 
 sovereignty and independence of any of the said Provinces 
 In 1825 there was a long debate in the House relating to an unconditional appropriation for the expenses of 
 the ministers to the Panama Congress According to Mr. Hinds 's summary of this debate the opposition to 
 the amendment led by Mr. Webster was that 
 While the Hose had an undoubted right to express its general opinion in regard to questions of 
 foreign policy in this case it was proposed to decide what should be  
 ministers already appointed If such instructions might be   in this case they 
 might be furnished in all thus usurping the power of the Executive 
 James Buchanan and John Forsythe who argued in favor of the amendment contended that it did not 
 amount to any instruction to diplomatic agents but was a proper expression of   The 
 House had always exercised the right of expressing its opinion on great questions either foreign or 
 domestic and such expressions were never thought to be an improper interference with the Executive 
 In April 1864 the House originated and passed a resolution declaring that 
 It did not accord with the policy of the United States to acknowledge a monarchical government 
 erected on the ruins of any republican government in America under the auspices of any European 
 power 
 On May 23 the House passed a resolution requesting the President to communicated any explanation given 
 by the Government of the United States to France respecting the sense and bearing of the joint resolution 
 relative to Mexico 
 The President transmitted the correspondence to the House The correspondence disclosed that Secretary 
 Seward had transmitted a copy of the resolution to our minister to France with the explanation that 
 This is a practical and purely executive question and the decision of its constitutionality belongs not 
 to the House of Representatives or even to Congress but to the President of the United States 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            6 
 After a protracted struggle evidently accompanied with much feeling the House of Representatives 
 adopted the following resolution which had been reported by Mr. Henry Winter Davis from the Committee 
 on Foreign Affairs 
 Resolved That Congress has a constitutional right to an authoritative voice in declaring and 
 prescribing the foreign policy of the United States as well in the recognition of new powers as in 
 other matters and it is the constitutional duty of the President to respect that policy no less in 
 diplomatic negotiations than in the use of the national force when authorized by law 
 It will be observed from the language last read that it was assumed as a matter of course that Congress had 
 an authoritative voice as to the use of the national forces to be made in time of war and that it was the 
 constitutional duty of the President to respect the policy of the Congress in that regard and Mr. Davis in the 
 resolution just read argued that it was the duty of the President to respect the authority of Congress in 
 diplomatic negotiations even as he must respect it when the Congress determined the policy of the 
 Government in the use of the national forces The portion of the resolution I have just read was adopted by 
 a vote of 119 to 8 The balance of the resolution was   majority and was as follows 
 And the propriety of any declaration of foreign   sufficiently   which 
 pronounces it and such proposition while pending and undetermined is not a fit topic of diplomatic 
 explanation with any foreign power 
 The joint resolution of 1898 declaring the intervention of the United States to remedy conditions existing in 
 the island of Cuba is recent history and familiar to all This resolution embodied a clear declaration of foreign 
 policy regarding Cuba as well as a declaration of war It passed both branches of Congress and was signed 
 by the President 
 After reciting the abhorrent conditions existing in Cuba it reads as follows 
 Resolved etc First That the people of the island of Cuba are and of right ought to be free and 
 independent 
 Second That it is the duty of the United States to demand and the Government of the United 
 States does hereby demand that the Government of the United States does hereby demand that 
 the Government of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cuba and 
 withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters 
 Third That the President of the United States be and he hereby is directed and empowered to use 
 the entire land and naval forces of the United States and to call into the actual service of the United 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            7 
 States the militia of the several States to such extent as my be necessary to carry these resolutions 
 into effect 
 Fourth That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty 
 jurisdiction or control over said island except for the pacification thereof and asserts its 
 determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its 
 people 
 On April 28 1904 a joint resolution was   of Congress in the following terms 
 That it is the sense of the Congress of the united States that it is desirable in the interests of uniformity of 
  in time of war that the President endeavor to bring about an understanding 
 among the principal maritime powers with a view to incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations 
 the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea not contraband of war from capture or 
 destruction by belligerents 
 Here it will be observed that the Congress   direct the President as to the policy of 
 exempting from capture private property at sea no contraband of war in not only one war merely but in all 
 wars providing that other maritime powers could be brought to adopt the same policy So far as I am aware 
 there is an unbroken line of   this subject down to the time of the present 
 administration It is true that in 1846 President Polk without consulting Congress assumed to send the 
 Army of the United States into territory the title of which was in dispute between the United States and 
 Mexico thereby precipitating bloodshed and the Mexican War But it is also true that this act was 
 condemned as   constitutional lawyers of the country and Abraham Lincoln 
 when he became a Member of the next Congress voted for and supported the resolution called the 
 Ashmun amendment which passed the House of Representatives declaring that the Mexican War had 
 been unnecessarily and unconstitutionally   of the United States 
 That the full significance of this resolution was   of Representatives is shown by the 
 speech of Mr. Venable Representative from North Carolina and a warm supporter of President Polk made 
 in the House January 12 1848 where referring to this resolution he says 
 Eighty five members of this House sustained that amendment and it now constitutes one of our 
 recorded acts I will not here stop to inquire as to the moral effect upon the Mexican people and the 
 Mexican government which will result to us from such a vote in the midst of a war I suppose 
 gentlemen have fully weighed this matter Neither will I now inquire how much such a vote will 
 strengthen our credit or facilitate the Government in furnishing the necessary supply of troops  
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            8 
 They have   that the President has violated the Constitution in the most flagrant manner 
 that every drop of blood which has been shed every bone which now whitens the plains of Mexico every 
 heart wringing agony which has been produced must be placed to his account who has so flagitiously 
 violated the Constitution and involved the Nation in the horrors or war This the majority of this House have 
 declared on oath The grand inquest of the Nation have asserted the fact and fixed it on their records and I 
 here demand of them to impeach the President 
 That Mr. Lincoln was in no manner deterred from the discharge of his duty as he saw it is evidenced by the 
 fact that on the day following the speech of Representative Venable Lincoln replied with one of the ablest 
 speeches of his career the opening sentences of which I desire to quote He said 
 Some if not all the gentlemen of the other side of the House who have addressed the committee within the 
 last two days have spoken rather complainingly if I have rightly understood them if the vote given a week 
 or 10 days ago declaring that the War with Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by 
 the President 
 I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness and that the one given is justly 
 censurable if it have no other or better foundation I am one of those who joined in that vote and I did so 
 under my best impression of the truth of the case 
 Lincoln then proceeded to demonstrate the truth of the charge as he regarded it Evidently he did not think 
 that patriotism in war more than in peace required the suppression of the truth respecting anything 
 pertaining to the conduct of the war 
 And yet today Mr. President for merely suggesting a possible disagreement with the administration on any 
 measure submitted or the offering of amendments to increase the tax upon incomes or on war profits is 
 treason to our country and an effort to serve the enemy  
 Since the Constitution vests in Congress the supreme power to determine when and for what purposes the 
 country will engage in war and the objects to attain which the war will be prosecuted it seems to me to be 
 an evasion of a solemn duty on the part of the Congress not to exercise that power at this critical time in the 
 Nation 's affairs The Congress can no more avoid its responsibility in this matte than it can in any other As 
 the Nation 's purposes in conducting this war are of supreme importance to the country it is the supreme 
 duty of Congress to exercise the function conferred upon   of guiding the foreign policy 
 of the Nation in the present crisis 
 A minor duty may be  minor responsibility avoided without disaster resulting but on 
 this momentous question there can be no evasion no shirking of duty of the Congress without subverting

 our form of government If our Constitution is to be changed so as to give the President the power to 
 determine the purposes for which this Nation will engage in war and the conditions on which it will make 
 peace then let that change be made   to the constitution proposed and 
 adopted in a constitutional manner It would be bad enough if the Constitution clothed the President with any 
 such power but to exercise such power without constitutional authority can not long be tolerated if even the 
 forms of free government are to remain We all know that no amendment to the constitution giving the 
 President the powers suggested would be   We know that if such an amendment 
 were to be proposed it would be overwhelmingly defeated 
 The universal conviction of those who yet believe in the rights of the people is that the first step toward the 
 prevention of war and the establishment of peace permanent peace is to give the people who must bear 
 the brunt of war 's awful burden more to say about it The masses will understand that it was the evil of a 
 one man power exercised in a half dozen nations through the malevolent influences of a system of secret 
 diplomacy that plunged the helpless peoples of Europe into the awful war that has been raging with 
 increasing horror and fury ever since it began and that now threatens to engulf the world before it stops 
 No conviction is stronger with the people today than that there should be no future wars except in case of 
 actual invasion unless a plebiscite a vote of ratification upon the declaration of 
 war before it shall become effective 
 And because there is no clearness of understanding no unity of opinion in this country on the part of the 
 people as to the conditions upon which we are prosecuting this war or what the specific objects are upon the 
 attainment of which the present administration would be willing to conclude a peace it becomes still more 
 imperative each day that Congress should assert its constitutional power to define and declared the objects 
 of this war which will afford the basis for a conference and for the establishment of permanent peace The 
 President has asked the German people to speak for themselves on this great world issue why should not 
 the American people voice their convictions through their chosen representatives in Congress 
 Ever since new Russia appeared upon the map she has been holding out her hands to free America to 
 come to her support in declaring for a clear understanding of the objects to be attained to secure peace 
 Shall we let this most remarkable revolution the world has ever witnessed appeal to us in vain 
 We have been six months at war We have incurred financial obligation and made expenditures of money in 
 amounts already so large that the human mind can not comprehend them The Government has drafted 
 from the peaceful occupations of civil life a million of our finest young men and more will be taken if 
 necessary to be transported 4,000 miles over the sea with their equipment and supplies to the trenches 
 of Europe

 The first chill winds of autumn remind us that another winter is at hand The imagination is paralyzed at the 
 thought of the human misery the indescribable suffering which the winter months with their cold and sleet 
 and ice and snow must bring to the war swept lands not alone to the soldiers at the front but to the 
 noncombatants at home 
 To such excesses of cruelty has this war descended that each nation is now as a part of its strategy 
 planning to starve the women and children of the enemy countries Each warring nation is carrying out the 
 unspeakable plan of starving noncombatants Each nurses the hope that it may break the spirit of the men 
 of the enemy country at the   wives and babes at home and woe be it that we have 
 become partners in this awful business and are even cutting off food shipments from neutral countries in 
 order to force them to help starve women and children of the country against whom we have declared war 
 There may be some necessity overpowering enough to justify these things but the people of America 
 should demand to know what results are expected to satisfy the sacrifice of all that civilization holds dear 
 upon the bloody altar of a conflict which employs such desperate methods of warfare 
 The question is Are we to sacrifice millions of our young men the very promise of the land --and spend 
 billions and more billions and pile up the cost of living until we starve and for what Shall the fearfully 
 overburdened people of this country continue to bear the brunt of a prolonged war for any objects not openly 
 stated and defined 
 The answer sir rests in my judgment with the Congress whose duty it is to declare our specific purposes 
 in the present war and to state the objects upon the attainment of which we will make peace 
 CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE MADE ON CONSTITUTIONAL LINES 
 And sir this is the ground on which I stand I maintain that Congress has the right and the duty to declare 
 the objects of the war and the people have the right and the obligation to discuss it 
 American citizens may hold all shades of opinion as to the war one citizen may glory in it another may 
 deplore it each has the same right to voice his judgment An American citizen may think and say that we 
 are not justified in prosecuting this war for the purpose of dictating the form of government which shall be 
  or our ally and not be subject to punishment at law He may pray aloud that our 
 boys shall not be sent to fight and die on European battle fields for the annexation of territory or the 
 maintenance of trade agreements and be within his legal rights He may express the hope that an early 
 peace may be secured on the terms set   Russia   in his speech of 
 January 22 1917 and he can not lawfully be sent to jail for the expression of his convictions 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            1 
 It is the citizen 's duty to obey the law until it is repealed or declared unconstitutional But he has the 
 inalienable right to fight what he deems an obnoxious law or a wrong policy in the courts and at the ballot 
 box 
 It is the suppressed emotion of the masses that breeds revolution 
 If the American people are to carry on this great war if public opinion is to be enlightened and intelligent 
 there must be free discussion 
 Congress as well as the people of the United States entered the war in great confusion of mind and under 
 feverish excitement The President 's leadership was followed in the faith that he had some big unrevealed 
  that would exalt him before all the world would soon be achieved 
 Gradually reluctantly Congress and the country are beginning to perceive that we are in this terrific world 
 conflict not only to right our wrongs not only to aid the allies not only to share its awful death toll and its 
 fearful tax burden but perhaps to bear the brunt of the war 
 And so I say if we are to forestall the danger of being drawn into years of war perhaps finally to maintain 
 imperialism and exploitation the people must unite in a campaign along constitutional lines for free 
 discussion of the policy of the war and its conclusion on a just basis 
 Permit me sir this word in conclusion It is   for whose opinions I have profound 
 respect and whose motives I know to be sincere that we are in this war and must go through to the end 
 That is true But it is not true that we must go through to the end to accomplish an undisclosed purpose or 
 to reach an unknown goal 
 I believe that whatever there is of honest difference of opinion concerning this war arises precisely at this 
 point 
 There is and of course can be no real difference of opinion concerning the duty of the citizen to discharge 
 to the last limit whatever obligation the war lays upon him 
 Our young men are being   of thousands for the purpose of waging this war on the 
 Continent of Europe possibly Asia or Africa or anywhere else that they may be ordered Nothing must be 
 left undone for their protection They must have the best army ammunition and equipment that money can 
 buy 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            2 
 They must have the best training and the best officers which this great country can provide The dependents 
 and relatives they leave at home must be provided for not meagerly but generously so far as money can 
 provide for them 
 I have done some of the hardest work of my life during the last few weeks on the revenue bill to raise the 
 largest possible amount of money from surplus incomes and war profits for this war and upon other 
 measures to provide for the protection of the soldiers and their families That I was not able to accomplish 
 more along this line is a great disappointment to me I did all that I could and I shall continue to fight with all 
 the power at my command until wealth is made to bear more of the burden of this war than has been laid 
 upon   Congress Concerning these matters there can be no difference of opinion We have 
 not yet been able to muster the forces to conscript wealth as we have conscripted men but no one has 
 ever been able to advance even a plausible argument for not doing so 
 No Mr. President it is on the other point suggested where honest differences of opinion may arise Shall we 
 ask the people of this country to shut their eyes and take the entire war program on faith There are no 
 doubt many honest and well meaning persons who are willing to answer that question in the affirmative 
 rather than risk the dissensions which they fear may follow a free discussion of the issues of this war With 
 that position I do not I can not agree Have the people no intelligent contribution to make to the solution of 
 the problems of this war I believe that they have and that in this matter as in so many others they may be 
 wiser than their leaders and that if left free to discuss the issues of the war they will find the correct 
 settlement of these issues 
 But it is said that Germany will fight with greater determination if her people believe that we are not in 
 perfect agreement Mr. President that is the same worn out pretext which has been used for three years to 
 keep the plain people of Europe engaged in killing each other in this war And sir as applied to this country 
 at least it is a pretext with nothing to support it 
 The way to paralyze the German arm to weaken the German military force in my opinion is to declare our 
 objects in this war and   to the German people that we are not seeking to dictate a 
 form of government to Germany or to render more secure England 's domination of the seas 
 A declaration of our purposes in this war so far from strengthening our enemy I believe would 
 immeasurably weaken her for it would no longer be possible to misrepresent our purposes to the German 
 people Such a course on our part so far from endangering the life of a single one of our boys I believe 
 would result in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of   an earlier and more 
 lasting instead of securing a   exhaustion of one or 
 the other of the belligerents 
  
  
 
                  
              
              
                          
            
            
                                                            3 
 Such a course would also immeasurably I believe strengthen our military force in this country because 
 when the objects of this war are clearly stated and the people approve of those objects they will give to the 
 war a popular support it will never otherwise receive 
 Then again honest dealing with the entente allies as well as with our own people requires a clear 
 statement of our objects in this war If we do not expect to support the entente allies in the dreams of 
 conquest we know some of them entertain then in all fairness to them that fact should be stated now 
 If we do expect to support them in their plans for conquest and aggrandizement then our people are entitled

47,John L. Lewis,Labor and the Nation,1937," 
 
 Out of the agony and travail of economic America the Committee for Industrial Organization 
 was born To millions of Americans exploited without   and socially 
 debased beyond the understanding of the fortunate its coming was as welcomed as the dawn 
 to the night watcher To a lesser group of Americans infinitely more fortunately situated 
 blessed with larger quantities of the world ’s goods and insolent in their assumption of 
 privilege its coming was heralded as a harbinger of ill sinister of purpose of unclean 
 methods and non virtuous objectives But the Committee for Industrial Organizations is here 
 It is now henceforth a definite instrumentality destined greatly to influence the lives of our 
 people and the internal and external course of the republic 
 This is true only because the purposes and objectives of the Committee for Industrial 
 Organization find economic social political and moral justification in the hearts of the millions 
 who are its members and the millions more who support it The organization and constant 
 onward sweep of this movement exemplifies the resentment of the many toward the 
 selfishness greed and the neglect of the few 
  
  
 
                                                          
 The workers of the nation were tired of waiting for corporate industry to right their economic 
 wrongs to alleviate their social agony and to grant them their political rights Despairing of 
 fair treatment they resolved to do something for themselves They therefore have organized 
 a new labor movement conceived within the principles of the national bill of rights and 
 committed to the proposition that the workers are free to assemble in their own forums voice 
 their own grievances declare their own hopes and contract on even terms with modern 
 industry for the sale of their only material possession their labor 
 The Committee for Industrial Organization has a numerical enrollment of 3,718,000 members 
 It has 32 affiliated national and international unions Of this number 11 unions account for 
 2,765,000 members This group is organized in the textile auto garment lumber rubber 
 electrical manufacturing power steel coal and transport industries The remaining 
 membership exists in the maritime oil production and refining ship building leather 
 chemical retail meat packing vegetable canning metalliferous mining miscellaneous 
 manufacturing agricultural labor and service and miscellaneous industries Some 200,000 
 workers are organized into 507 chartered local unions not yet attached to a national industrial 
 union 
 This record bespeaks progress It is a development without precedent in our own country 
 Some of this work was accomplished with the enlightened cooperation or the tolerant 
 acquiescence of employers who recognized that a new labor movement was being forged and 
 who were not disposed in any event to flout the law of the land On the other hand much of 
 this progress was made in the face of violent and deadly opposition which reached its climax 
 in the slaughter of workers paralleling the massacres of Ludlow and Homestead 
 In the steel industry the corporations generally have accepted collective bargaining and 
 negotiated wage agreements with the Committee for Industrial Organization Eighty five per 
 cent of the industry is thus under contract and a peaceful relationship exits between the 
 management and the workers Written wage contracts have been negotiated with 399 steel 
 companies covering 510,000 men One thousand thirty one local lodges in 700 communities 
 have been organized 
 Five of the corporations in the steel industry elected to resist collective bargaining and 
 undertook to destroy the steel workers union These companies filled their plants with 
 industrial spies assembled depots of guns and gas bombs established barricades controlled 
 their communities with armed thugs leased the police power of cities and mobilized the 
 military power of a state to guard them against the intrusion of collective bargaining within 
 their plants 
  
  
 
                                                          
 During this strike 18 steel workers were either shot to death or had their brains clubbed out 
 by police or armed thugs in the pay of the steel companies In Chicago Mayor Kelly 's police 
 force was successful in killing ten strikers before they could escape the fury of the police 
 shooting eight of them in the back One hundred sixty strikers were maimed and injured by 
 police clubs riot guns and gas bombs and were hospitalized Hundreds of strikers were 
 arrested jailed treated with brutality while incarcerated and harassed by succeeding 
 litigation None but strikers were murdered gassed injured jailed or maltreated No one had 
 to die except the workers who were standing for the right guaranteed  
 and written in the law 
 The infamous Governor Davey of Ohio successful in the last election because of his reiterated 
 promises of fair treatment to labor used the military power of the Commonwealth on the side 
 of the Republican Steel Company and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company Nearly half 
 of the staggering military expenditure incident to the crushing of this strike in Ohio was borne 
 by the federal government through the allocation of financial aid to the military establishment 
 of the state 
 The steel workers have now buried their dead while the widows weep and watch their 
 orphaned children become objects of public charity The murder of these unarmed men has 
 never been publicly   officer of the state or federal government 
 Some of them in extenuation plead lack of jurisdiction but murder as a crime against the 
 moral code can always be rebuked without regard to the niceties of legalistic jurisdiction by 
 those who profess to be the keepers of the public conscience 
 Shortly after Kelly 's police force in Chicago had indulged in their bloody orgy Kelly came to 
 Washington looking for political patronage That patronage was forthcoming and Kelly must 
 believe that the killing of the strikers is no liability in partisan politics 
 Meanwhile the steel puppet Davey is still Governor of Ohio but not for long I think not for 
 long The people of Ohio may be relied upon to mete our political justice to one who has 
 betrayed his state outraged the public conscience and besmirched the public honor 
 While the men of the steel industry were going through blood and gas in defense of their 
 rights and their homes and their families elsewhere on the far flung C.I.O. front the hosts of 
 labor were advancing and intelligent and permanent progress was being made In scores of 
 industries plant after plant and company after company were negotiating sensible working 
 agreements 
  
  
 
                                                          
 The men in the steel industry who sacrificed their all were nor merely aiding their fellows at 
 home but were adding strength to the cause of their comrades in all industry Labor was 
 marching toward the goal of industrial democracy and contributing constructively toward a 
 more rational arrangement of our domestic economy 
 Labor does not see industrial strife It wants peace but a peace with justice In the long 
 struggle for labor ’s rights it has been patient and forbearing Sabotage and destruction 
 syndicalism have had no part in the American labor movement Workers have kept faith in 
 American institutions Most of the conflicts which have occurred have been when labor ’s right 
 to live has been challenged and denied 
 If there is to be peace in our industrial life let the employer recognize his obligation to his 
 employees at least to the degree set forth in existing statutes Ordinary problems affecting 
 wages hours and working conditions in most instances will quickly respond to negotiation in 
 the council room 
 The United States Chamber of Commerce the National Association of Manufacturers and 
 similar groups representing industry and financial interests are rendering a disservice to the 
 American people in their attempts to frustrate the organization of labor and in their refusal to 
 accept collective bargaining as one of our economic institutions 
 These groups are encouraging a systematic organization of vigilante groups to fight 
 unionization under the sham pretext of local interests They equip these vigilantes with tin 
 hats wooden clubs gas masks and lethal weapons and train them in the arts of brutality and 
 oppression They bring in snoops finks hatchet gangs and Chowderhead Cohens to infest 
 their plants and disturb the communities 
 Fascist organizations have been launched and financed under the shabby pretext that the 
 C.I.O. movement is communistic The real breeders of discontent and alien doctrines of 
 government and philosophies subversive of good citizenship are such as these who take the 
 law into their own hands 
 No tin hat brigade of goose stepping vigilantes or bibble babbling mob of blackguarding and 
 corporation paid scoundrels will prevent the onward march of labor or divert its purpose to 
 play its natural and rational part in the development of the economic political and social life of 
 our nation 
  
  
 
                                                          
 Unionization as opposed to communism presupposes the relation of employment it is based 
 upon the wage system and it recognizes fully and unreservedly the institution of private 
 property and the right to investment profit It is upon the fuller development of collective 
 bargaining the wider expansion of the labor movement the increased influence of labor in our 
 national councils that the perpetuity of our democratic institutions must largely depend 
 The organized workers of America free in their industrial life conscious partners in 
 production secure in their homes and enjoying a decent standard of living will prove the 
 finest bulwark against the intrusion of alien doctrines of government  
 Do those who have hatched this foolish cry of communism in the C.I.O. fear the increased 
 influence of labor in our democracy Do they fear its influence will be cast on the side of 
 shorter hours a better system of distributed employment better homes for the under- 
 privileged social security for the aged a fairer distribution of the national income 
 Certainly the workers that are being organized want a voice in the determination of these 
 objectives of social justice Certainly labor wants a fairer share in the national income 
 Assuredly labor wants a larger participation in increased productive efficiency Obviously the 
 population is entitled to participate in the fruits of the genius of our men of achievement in the 
 field of the material sciences 
 Labor has suffered just as our farm population has suffered from a viciously unequal 
 distribution of the national income In the exploitation of both classes of workers has been the 
 source of panic and depression and upon the economic welfare of both rests the best 
 assurance of a sound and permanent prosperity 
 In this connection let me call attention to the propaganda which some of our industrialists are 
 carrying on among the farmers By pamphlets in the milk cans or attached to machinery and 
 in countless other ways of direct and indirect approach the farmers of the nation are being 
 told that the increased price of farm machinery and farm supplies is due to the rising wage 
 level brought   And yet it is the industrial 
 millions of this country who constitute the substantial market for all agricultural products 
 The interest of the two groups are mutually dependent It is when the pay roll goes down that 
 the farmer 's realization is diminished so that his loans become overdue at the bank and the 
 arrival of the tax collector is awaited with fear On the other hand it is the prosperity of the 
 farmer that quickness the tempo of manufacturing activities and brings buying power to the 
 millions of urban and industrial workers 
  
  
 
                                                          
 As we view the years that have passed this has always been true and it becomes increasingly 
 imperative that the farm population and the millions of workers in industry must learn to 
 combine their strength for the attainment of mutual and desirable objectives and at the same 
 time learn to guard themselves against the sinister propaganda of those who would divide and 
 exploit them 
 Under the banner of the Committee for Industrial Organization American labor is on the 
 march Its objectives today are those it had in the beginning to strive for the unionization of 
 our unorganized millions of workers and for the acceptance of collective bargaining as a 
 recognized American institution 
 It seeks peace with the industrial world It seeks cooperation and mutuality of effort with the 
 agricultural population It would avoid strikes It would have its rights determined under the 
  negotiations and contract relationships that are supposed to characterize 
 American commercial life 
 Until an aroused public opinion demands that employers accept that rule labor has no 
 recourse but to surrender its rights or struggle for their realization with its own economic 
 power 
 The objectives of this movement are not political in a partisan sense Yet it is true that a 
 political party which seeks the support of labor and makes pledges of good faith to labor must 
 in equity and good conscience keep that faith and redeem those pledges 
 The spectacle of august and dignified members of Congress servants of the people and 
 agents of the republic skulking in hallways and closets hiding their faces in a party caucus to 
 prevent a quorum from acting upon a labor measure is one that emphasizes the perfidy of 
 politicians and blasts the confidence of labor 's millions in politician 's promises and statesmen 's 
 vows 
 Labor next year can not avoid the necessity of a political assay of the work and deeds of its 
 so called friends and its political beneficiaries It must determine who are its friends in the 
 arena of politics as elsewhere It feels that its cause is just and that its friends should not view 
 its struggle with neutral detachment or intone constant criticism of its activities 
 Those who chant their praises of democracy but who lose no chance to drive their knives into 
 labor 's defenseless back must feel the weight of labor 's woe even as its open adversaries must 
 ever feel the thrust of labor 's power 
  
  
 
                                                          
 Labor like Israel has many sorrows Its women weep for their fallen and they lament for the 
 future of the children of the race It ill behooves one who has supped at labor 's table and who 
 has been sheltered in labor 's house to curse with equal fervor and fine impartiality both labor 
 and its adversaries when they become locked in deadly embrace 
 I repeat that labor seeks peace and guarantees its own loyalty but the voice of labor 
 insistent upon its rights should not be annoying to the ears of justice or offensive to the 
 conscience of the American people",0.0246391166001558,0.0178723726421594,0.0604609549045562,0.0485459305346012,0.0324513390660285,0.8138461709022522,0.0021840739063918,0.0621270621270621,0.3781984906984908,32.32069691470056,0.3703470031545741,0.009025270758122744,0.10798816568047337,0.04941176470588235,28.26530612244898,1.0
48,Franklin D. Roosevelt,The Great Arsenal of Democracy,1940," 
 
 
 My friends  
 This is not a fireside chat on war It is a talk on national security because the nub of the 
 whole purpose of your President is to keep you now and your children later and your 
 grandchildren much later out of a last ditch war for the preservation of American 
 independence and all of the things that American independence means to you and to me and 
 to ours 
 Tonight in the presence of a world crisis my mind goes back eight years to a night in the 
 midst of a domestic crisis It was a time when the wheels of American industry were grinding 
 to a full stop when the whole banking system of our country had ceased to function I well 
 remember that while I sat in my study in the White House preparing to talk with the people 
 of the United States I had before my eyes the picture of all those Americans with whom I was 
 talking I saw the workmen in the mills the mines the factories the girl behind the counter 
 the small shopkeeper the farmer doing his spring plowing the widows and the old men 
  
  
 
                                            
 wondering about their life 's savings I tried to convey to the great mass of American people 
 what the banking crisis meant to them in their daily lives 
 Tonight I want to do the same thing with the same people in this new crisis which faces 
 America We met the issue of 1933 with courage and realism We face this new crisis this 
 new threat to the security of our nation with the same courage and realism Never before 
 since Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization been in such danger as 
 now For on September 27th 1940 this  signed in Berlin three 
 powerful nations two in Europe and one in Asia joined themselves together in the threat that 
 if the United States of America interfered with or blocked the expansion program of these 
 three nations a program aimed at world control they would unite in ultimate action 
 against the United States 
 The Nazi masters of Germany have made it clear that they intend not only to dominate all life 
 and thought in their own country but also to enslave the whole of Europe and then to use 
 the resources of Europe to dominate the rest of the world It was only three weeks ago that 
 their leader stated this There are two worlds that stand opposed to each other And then in 
 defiant reply to his opponents he said this Others are correct when they say With this 
 world we can not ever reconcile ourselves I can beat any other power in the world So said 
 the leader of the Nazis 
 In other words the Axis not merely admits but the Axis proclaims that there can be no 
 ultimate peace between their philosophy their philosophy of government and our 
 philosophy of government In view of the nature of this undeniable threat it can be asserted 
 properly and categorically that the United States has no right or reason to encourage talk of 
 peace until the day shall come when there is a clear intention on the part of the aggressor 
 nations to abandon all thought of dominating or conquering the world 
 At this moment the forces of the States that are leagued against all peoples who live in 
 freedom are being held away from our shores The Germans and the Italians are being 
 blocked on the other side of the    
 soldiers and sailors who were able to escape from subjugated countries In Asia the Japanese 
 are being   nation in another great defense In the Pacific Ocean is our 
 fleet 
  
  
 
                                            
 Some of our people like to believe that wars in Europe and in Asia are of no concern to us But 
 it is a matter of most vital concern to us that European and Asiatic war makers should not 
 gain control of the oceans which lead to this hemisphere One hundred and seventeen years 
 ago the Monroe Doctrine was   as a measure of defense in the 
 face of a threat against this   Thereafter we 
 stood guard in the Atlantic with the British as neighbors There was no treaty There was no 
 unwritten agreement And yet there was the feeling proven  we as 
 neighbors could settle any disputes in peaceful fashion And the fact is that during the whole 
 of this time the Western Hemisphere has remained free from aggression from Europe or from 
 Asia 
 Does anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack anywhere in the Americas while a 
 free Britain remains our most powerful naval neighbor in the Atlantic And does anyone 
 seriously believe on the other hand that we could rest easy if the Axis powers were our 
 neighbors there If Great Britain goes down the Axis powers will control the Continents of 
 Europe Asia Africa Austral Asia and the high seas And they will be in a position to bring 
 enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere It is no exaggeration to say 
 that all of us in all the Americas would be living at the point of a gun a gun loaded with 
 explosive bullets economic as well as military We should enter upon a new and terrible era in 
 which the whole world our hemisphere included would be   brute force And 
 to survive in such a world we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic 
 power on the basis of war economy 
 Some of us like to believe that even if Britain falls we are still safe because of the broad 
 expanse of the Atlantic and of the Pacific But the width of those oceans is not what it was in 
 the days of clipper ships At one point between Africa and Brazil the distance is less than it is 
 from Washington to Denver Colorado five hours for the latest type of bomber And at the 
 north end of the Pacific Ocean America and Asia almost touch each other Why even today 
 we have planes that could fly from the British Isles to New England and back again without 
 refueling And remember that the range of the modern bomber is ever being increased 
 During the past week many people in all parts of the nation have told me what they wanted 
 me to say tonight Almost all of them expressed a courageous desire to hear the plain truth 
 about the gravity of the situation One telegram however expressed the attitude of the small 
 minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil even though they know in their hearts that 
  
  
 
                                            
 evil exists That telegram begged me not to tell again of the ease with which our American 
 cities could be   power which had gained bases in this Western 
 Hemisphere The gist of that telegram was Please Mr. President do n't frighten us by telling 
 us the facts Frankly and definitely there is danger ahead danger against which we must 
 prepare But we well know that we can not escape danger or the fear of danger by crawling 
 into bed and pulling the covers over our heads 
 Some nations of Europe were   Other 
 nations were   they need never fear invasion Nonintervention pact or 
 not the fact remains that they were attacked overrun thrown into modern slavery at an 
 hour 's notice or even without any notice at all As an exiled leader of one of these nations 
 said to me the other day The notice was a minus quantity It was given to my government 
 two hours after German troops had poured into my country in a hundred places The fate of 
 these nations tells us what it means to live at the point of a Nazi gun 
 The Nazis have justified such   frauds One of these frauds is the claim 
 that they are occupying a nation for the purpose of restoring order Another is that they are 
 occupying or controlling a nation on the excuse that they are protecting it against the 
 aggression of somebody else For example Germany has said that she was occupying Belgium 
 to save the Belgians from the British Would she then hesitate to say to any South American 
 country We are occupying you to protect you from   States 
 Belgium today is being used as an invasion base against Britain now fighting for its life And 
 any South American country in Nazi hands would always constitute a jumping off place for 
 German attack on any one of the other republics of this hemisphere 
 Analyze for yourselves the future of two other places even nearer to Germany if the Nazis 
 won Could Ireland hold out Would Irish freedom be permitted as an amazing pet exception 
 in an unfree world Or the islands of the Azores which still fly the flag of Portugal after five 
 centuries You and I think of Hawaii as an outpost of defense in the Pacific And yet the 
 Azores are closer to our shores in the Atlantic than Hawaii is on the other side 
 There are those who say that the Axis powers would never have any desire to attack the 
 Western Hemisphere That is the same dangerous form of wishful thinking which has 
 destroyed the powers of resistance of so many conquered peoples The plain facts are that the 
 Nazis have proclaimed time and again that all other races are their inferiors and therefore 
  
  
 
                                            
 subject to their orders And most important of all the vast resources and wealth of this 
 American hemisphere constitute the most tempting loot in all of the round world 
 Let us no longer blind ourselves to the undeniable fact that the evil forces which have crushed 
 and undermined and corrupted so many others are already within our own gates Your 
 government knows much about them and every day is ferreting them out Their secret 
 emissaries are active in our own and in neighboring countries They seek to stir up suspicion 
 and dissension to cause internal strife They try to turn capital against labor and vice versa 
 They try to reawaken long slumbering racial and religious enmities which should have no place 
 in this country They are active in every group that promotes intolerance They exploit for 
 their own ends our own natural   abhorrence of war These trouble breeders have but one 
 purpose It is to divide our people to divide them into hostile groups and to destroy our unity 
 and shatter our will to defend ourselves 
 There are also American citizens many of them in high places who unwittingly in most 
 cases are aiding and abetting the work of these agents I do not charge these American 
 citizens with being foreign agents But I do charge them with doing exactly the kind of work 
 that the dictators want done in the United States These people not only believe that we can 
 save our own   eyes to the fate of other nations Some of them go much 
 further than that They say that we can and should become the friends and even the partners 
 of the Axis powers Some of them even suggest that we should imitate the methods of the 
 dictatorships But Americans never can and never will do that 
 The experience of the past two years has proven beyond doubt that no nation can appease 
 the Nazis No man can tame a tiger into a   There can be no appeasement 
 with ruthlessness There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb We know now that a 
 nation can have peace with the Nazis only at the price of total surrender Even the people of 
 Italy have been forced to become accomplices of the Nazis but at this moment they do not 
 know how soon they will be embraced to  
 The American appeasers ignore the warning to be found in the fate of Austria Czechoslovakia 
 Poland Norway Belgium the Netherlands Denmark and France They tell you that the Axis 
 powers are going to win anyway that all of this bloodshed in the world could be saved that 
 the United States might just as well throw its influence into the scale of a dictated peace and 
 get the best out of it that we can They call it a negotiated peace Nonsense 
  
  
 
                                            
 Is it a negotiated peace if a gang of outlaws surrounds your community and on threat of 
 extermination makes you pay tribute to save your own skins For such a dictated peace would 
 be no peace at all It would be only another armistice leading to the most gigantic armament 
 race and the most devastating trade wars in all history And in these contests the Americas 
 would offer the only real resistance to the Axis power With all their vaunted efficiency with 
 all their parade of pious purpose in this war there are still in their background the 
 concentration camp and the servants of God in chains 
 The history of recent years proves that the shootings and the chains and the concentration 
 camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altars of modern dictatorships They 
 may talk of a new order in the world but what they have in mind is only a revival of the 
 oldest and the worst tyranny In that there is no liberty no religion no hope The proposed 
 new order is the very opposite of a United States of Europe or a United States of Asia It is 
 not a government based upon the consent of the governed It is not a union of ordinary self- 
 respecting men and women to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from 
 oppression It is an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and to enslave the human 
 race 
 The British people and their allies today are conducting an active war against this unholy 
 alliance Our own future security is greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight Our ability 
 to keep out of war is going to be   Thinking in terms of today and 
 tomorrow I make the direct statement to the American people that there is far less chance of 
 the United States getting into war if we do all we can now to support the nations defending 
 themselves against   than if   we acquiesce in their defeat submit tamely to 
 an Axis victory and wait our turn to be the object of attack in another war later on  
 If we are to be completely honest with ourselves we must admit that there is risk in any 
 course we may take But I deeply believe that the great majority of our people agree that the 
 course that I advocate involves the least risk now and the greatest hope for world peace in 
 the future 
 The people of Europe who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their fighting They 
 ask us for the implements of war the planes the tanks the guns the freighters which will 
 enable them to fight for their liberty and for our security Emphatically we must get these 
  
  
 
                                            
 weapons to them get them to them in sufficient volume and quickly enough so that we and 
 our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which others have had to endure 
 Let not the defeatists tell us that it is too late It will never be earlier Tomorrow will be later 
 than today  
 Certain facts are self evident  
 In a military sense Great Britain and the British Empire are today the spearhead of resistance 
 to world conquest And they are putting up a fight which will live forever in the story of human 
 gallantry There is no demand for sending an American expeditionary force outside our own 
 borders There is no   of your government to send such a force You 
 can therefore nail nail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth Our 
 national policy is not directed toward war Its sole purpose is to keep war away from our 
 country and away from our people 
 Democracy 's fight against world conquest is being greatly aided and must be more greatly 
  of the United States   ounce and every ton of 
 munitions and supplies that we can possibly spare to help the defenders who are in the front 
 lines And it is no more un neutral for us to do that than it is for Sweden Russia and other 
 nations near Germany to send steel and ore and oil and other war materials into Germany 
 every day in the week 
 We are planning our own defense with the utmost urgency and in its vast scale we must 
 integrate the war needs of Britain and the other free nations which are resisting aggression 
 This is not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion It is a matter of 
 realistic practical military policy based on the advice of our military experts who are in close 
 touch with existing warfare These military and naval experts and the members of the 
 Congress and the Administration have a single minded purpose the defense of the United 
 States  
 This nation is making a great effort to produce everything that is necessary in this emergency 
 and with all possible speed And this great effort requires great sacrifice I would ask no one 
 to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend every one in the nation against want

 to protect the economic well being of its citizens If our capacity to produce is limited by 
 machines it must ever be remembered that these machines are   and the 
 stamina of the workers  
 As the government is determined to protect the rights of the workers so the nation has a 
 right to expect that the men who man the machines will discharge their full responsibilities to 
 the urgent needs of defense The worker possesses the same human dignity and is entitled to 
 the same security of position as the engineer or the manager or the owner For the workers 
 provide the human power that turns out the destroyers and the planes and the tanks The 
 nation expects our defense industries to continue operation without  
 lockouts It expects and insists that management and workers will reconcile their differences 
 by voluntary or legal means to continue to produce the supplies that are so sorely needed 
 And on the economic side of our great defense program we are as you know bending every 
 effort to maintain stability of prices and with that the stability of the cost of living 
 Nine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our 
 gigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions The appropriation of vast sums of 
 money and a well coordinated executive direction of our defense efforts are not in themselves 
 enough Guns planes ships and many other things have to be built in the factories and the 
 arsenals of America They have to be   managers and engineers with 
 the aid of machines which in turn have to be   thousands of workers 
 throughout the land In this great work there has been splendid cooperation between the 
 government and industry and labor And I am very thankful 
 American industrial genius unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production 
 problems has been called upon to bring its resources and its talents into action 
 Manufacturers of watches of farm implements of Linotypes and cash registers and 
 automobiles and sewing machines and lawn mowers and locomotives are now making fuses 
 and bomb packing crates and telescope mounts and shells and pistols and tanks 
 But all of our present efforts are not enough We must have more ships more guns more 
 planes more of everything And this can be accomplished only if we discard the notion of 
 business as usual This job can not be done   the existing 
 productive facilities the added requirements of the nation for defense Our defense efforts 
 must not be   fear the future consequences of surplus plant capacity The 
  
  
 
                                            
 possible consequences of failure of our defense efforts now are much more to be feared And 
 after the present needs of our defense are past a proper handling of the country 's peacetime 
 needs will require all of the new productive capacity if not still more No pessimistic policy 
 about the future of America shall delay the immediate expansion of those industries essential 
 to defense We need them 
 I want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed 
 every machine every arsenal every factory that we need to manufacture our defense 
 material We have the men the skill the wealth and above all the will I am confident that if 
 and when production of consumer or luxury goods in certain industries requires the use of 
 machines and raw materials that are essential for defense purposes then such production 
 must yield and will gladly yield to our primary and compelling purpose 
 So I appeal to the owners of plants to the managers to the workers to our own government 
 employees to put every ounce of effort into producing these munitions swiftly and without 
 stint With this appeal I give you the pledge that all of us who are officers of your government 
 will devote ourselves to the same whole hearted extent to the great task that lies ahead 
 As planes and ships and guns and shells are produced your government with its defense 
 experts can then determine how best to use them to defend this hemisphere The decision as 
 to how much shall be sent abroad and how much shall remain at home must be made on the 
 basis of our overall military necessities 
 We must be the great arsenal of democracy  
 For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself We must apply ourselves to our task with 
 the same resolution the same sense of urgency the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as 
 we would show were we at war 
 We have furnished the British great material support and we will furnish far more in the 
 future There will be no bottlenecks in our determination to aid Great Britain No dictator no 
 combination of dictators will weaken that   how they will construe 
 that determination The British have received invaluable military support from the heroic 
 Greek Army and from the forces of all the governments in exile Their strength is growing 
  
  
 
                                            0 
 It is the strength of men and women who value their freedom more highly than they value 
 their lives 
 I believe that the Axis powers are not going to win this war I base that belief on the latest 
 and best of information 
 We have no excuse for defeatism We have every good reason for hope hope for peace 
 yes and hope for the defense of our civilization and for the building of a better civilization in 
 the future I have the profound conviction that the American people are now determined to 
 put forth a mightier effort than they have ever yet made to increase our production of all the 
 implements of defense to meet the threat to our democratic faith 
 As President of the United States I call for that national effort I call for it in the name of this 
 nation which we love and honor and which we are privileged and proud to serve I call upon 
 our people with absolute confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed",0.0172297842800617,0.0040844283066689,0.932176947593689,0.007169724907726,0.0223351828753948,0.0137160364538431,0.0032879959326237,0.1049168869105578,0.4279110797781681,57.26554085508616,0.2802964254577157,0.014081455805892547,0.09129738387613455,0.03847980997624703,24.423280423280424,1.0
49,McCarthy Welch Exchange Point of Order edition,Have You Left No Sense of Decency,1954," 
 
 
 Senator McCarthy Mr. Chairman in view of that request by Mr.  
 Senator Mundt Do you have a point of order 
   Senator McCarthy Not exactly Mr. Chairman But in view of Mr. 
 Welch 's request that the information be given once we know of anyone who might be 
 performing any work for the Communist Party I think we should tell him that he has in his 
 law firm a young man named Fisher whom he recommended incidentally to do the work on 
 this committee who has been for a number of years a member of an organization which is 
 named oh years and years ago as the legal bulwark of the Communist Party an 
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
 organization which always springs to the defense of anyone who dares to expose Communists 
 I certainly assume that Mr. Welch did not know of this young man at the time he 
 recommended as the assistant counsel for this committee But he has terror and such a great 
 desire to know where anyone is located who may be serving the communist cause Mr. Welch 
 And I thought we should just call your attention to the fact that your Mr. Fisher who is still in 
 your law firm today whom you asked to have down here looking over the secret and classified 
 material is a member of an organization not  named by various 
 committees   General as I recall And be belonged to it long after it 
 had been exposed as the legal arm of the Communist Party      
   Senator McCarthy Knowing that Mr. Welch I just felt that I had 
 a duty to respond to your urgent request that before sundown when we know of anyone 
 serving the Communist cause we let the agency know Now we 're now letting you know that 
 your man did belong to this organization for either three or four years belonged to it long 
 after he was out of law school Now I have hesitated bringing that up but I have been rather 
 bored with your phony requests to Mr. Cohn here that he personally get every Communist 
 out of Government before sundown therefore we will give you the information about the 
 young man in your own organization Now I 'm not asking you at this time to explain why you 
 tried to foist him on this committee that you did the committee knows Whether you knew 
 that he was a member of that Communist organization or not I do n't know I assume you did 
 not Mr. Welch because I get the impression that while you are quite an actor you play for a 
 laugh I do n't think you have any conception of the danger of the Communist Party I do n't 
 think you yourself would ever knowingly aid the Communist cause I think you 're 
 unknowingly aiding it when you try to burlesque this hearing in which we 're attempting to 
 bring out the facts however  
 Mr. Welch Mr. Chairman 
 Senator Mundt The Chair should say that he has no recognition no no memory of Mr. 
 Welch recommending either Mr. Fisher or anybody else as counsel for this committee 
 Mr. Welch Mr. Chairman 
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
 Senator Mundt Mr. Welch  
 Senator McCarthy I refer to the record then Mr. Chairman the  
 Mr. Welch Mr. Chairman 
 Senator McCarthy the news story on that 
 Mr. Welch Under these circumstances I must myself have something approaching a 
 personal privilege  
 Senator Mundt You may have it sir It will not be taken out of your time 
 Mr. Welch Senator McCarthy I did not know Senator Senator sometimes you say May 
 I have your attention McCarthy is consulting with and aide 
 Senator McCarthy I 'm listening I did n't know  
 Mr. Welch May I have your attention 
   Senator McCarthy I I can listen with one ear and talk with him 
   Mr. Welch   Now this time sir 
 Senator McCarthy Okay 
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
 Mr. Welch I want you to listen with both 
 Senator McCarthy All right got it 
 Mr. Welch Senator McCarthy I think until this moment 
 Senator McCarthy Good   Just just a minute Let me ask Jim Juliana Jim will you 
 get the news story to the effect that this man belonged to the to this Communist front 
 organization Would you get the  
 Mr. Welch I will tell you that he belonged to it 
 Senator McCarthy will will you get the the citations order the citations showing that 
 this was the legal arm of the Communist Party and the length of time that he belonged and 
 the fact that he was recommended by Mr. Welch I think that should be in the record for Mr. 
 Welch 
 Mr. Welch Senator 
 Senator Mundt The Chair recognizes Mr. Welch 
   Mr. Welch You wo n't need anything in the record when I finish 
 telling you this Until this moment Senator I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your 
 recklessness Fred Fisher is a young man who went to the Harvard Law School and came into 
 my firm and is starting what looks to be a brilliant career with us When I decided to work for 
 this committee I asked Jim St. Clair who sits on my right to be my first assistant I said to 
 Jim Pick somebody in the firm to work under you that you would like He chose Fred Fisher 
 and they came down on an afternoon plane That night when we had taken a little stab at 
 trying to see what the case is about Fred Fisher and Jim St. Clair and I went to dinner 
 together I then said to these two young men Boys I do n't know anything about you except 
 I 've always liked you But if there 's anything funny in the life of either one of you that would 
 hurt anybody in this case you speak up quick 
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
  Mr. Welch   And Fred Fisher said Mr. Welch when I was in the 
 law school and for a period of months after I belonged to the Lawyers Guild as you have 
 suggested Senator He went on to say I am Secretary of the Young Republican 's League in 
 Newton with the son of the Massachusetts governor and I have the respect and admiration 
 of my community and I 'm sure I have the respect and admiration of the twenty five lawyers 
 or so in Hale Dorr And I said Fred I just do n't think I 'm going to ask you to work on the 
 case If I do one of these days that will come out and go over national television and it will 
 just hurt like the dickens And so Senator I asked him to go back to Boston Little did I 
 dream you could be so reckless and so cruel as to do an injury to that lad It is true he is still 
 with Hale Dorr It is true that he will continue to be with Hale Dorr It is I regret to say 
 equally true that I fear he shall always bear a scar needlessly  it were in my 
 power to forgive you for your reckless cruelty I would do so I like to think I 'm a gentle man 
 but your forgiveness will have to come from someone other than me 
 Senator McCarthy Mr. Chairman 
 Senator Mundt inaudible 
 Senator McCarthy   May may I say that Mr. Welch talks about this being cruel and 
 reckless He was just baiting He has been baiting Mr. Cohn here for hours requesting that 
 Mr. Cohn before sundown get out of any department of the government anyone who is 
 serving the Communist cause Now I just give this man 's record and I want to say Mr. 
 Welch that it has been labeled long before he became a member as early as 1944 
 Mr. Welch Senator  
 Senator McCarthy   Let let me finish 
 Mr. Welch may we not drop this  
 Senator McCarthy   Let me finish 
 Mr. Welch We know he belonged to the Lawyers Guild   
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
 Senator McCarthy No let me finish 
 Mr. Welch And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me I did you I think no personal injury Mr. 
 Cohn 
   Mr. Cohn No sir  
 Mr. Welch I meant to do you no personal injury 
 Mr. Cohn No sir 
 Mr. Welch And if I did  
 Senator McCarthy No  
 Mr. Welch I beg your pardon Let us not assassinate this lad further Senator 
 Senator McCarthy Let 's let 's 
 Mr. Welch You 've done enough Have you no sense of decency sir at long last Have you 
 left no sense of decency 
 
 Senator McCarthy I know this hurts you Mr. Welch 
 Mr. Welch I 'll say it hurts 
  
  
 
                                                
                       
                       
                        
 Senator McCarthy May I say Mr. Chairman as point of personal privilege I 'd like to finish 
 this 
 Mr. Welch Senator I think it hurts you too sir 
 Senator McCarthy I 'd I 'd like to finish this I know Mr. Cohn would rather not have me go 
 into this I intend to however And Mr. Mr. Welch talks about any sense of decency It 
 seems that Mr. Welch is pained so deeply he thinks it 's improper for me to give the record  
 the Communist front record of the man whom he wanted to foist upon this committee But it 
 does n't pain him at all there 's no pain in his chest about the attempt to destroy the 
 reputation and the take the jobs away from the young men who are working on my 
 committee And Mr. Welch if if I have said anything here which is untrue then tell me I 
 have heard you and everyone else talk so much about laying the truth upon the table But 
 when I heard the completely phony Mr. Welch I 've been listening now for a long time 
 he 's saying Now before sundown you must get these people out of government So that I 
 just want you to have it very clear very clear that you were not so serious about that when 
 you tried to recommend this man for this committee But the point is  
 Senator Mundt The Chair would like to say again that  
 Senator McCarthy inaudible crosstalk  
 Senator Mundt he does n't believe that Mr. Welch recommended Mr. Fisher as counsel for 
 this committee because he has through his office all the recommendations which were made 
 and does not recall any of them coming from Mr. Welch and that would include Mr. Fisher  
 Senator McCarthy Well let me ask Mr. Welch You you brought him down did you not to 
 act as your assistant 
 Mr. Welch Mr. McCarthy I will not discuss this further with you You have sat within six feet 
 of me and could ask could have asked me about Fred Fisher You have seen fit to bring it 
 out and if there is a God in heaven it will do neither you nor your cause any good I will not 
 discuss it further I will not ask Mr. Cohn any more witnesses You Mr. Chairman may if you 
 will call the next witness",0.0243915058672428,0.0118977380916476,0.8870529532432556,0.0052220160141587,0.0465298257768154,0.0117379492148756,0.0131681095808744,0.0563556067588325,0.4911034306195595,68.34051090419018,0.1501524390243902,0.01014370245139476,0.06365503080082136,0.06708799222168206,20.22222222222222,1.0
50,Russell Conwell,Acres of Diamonds,5000," 
 
 When going down the Tigris and Euphrates rivers many years ago with a party of English 
 travelers I found myself under the direction of an old Arab guide whom we hired up at 
 Baghdad and I have often thought how that guide resembled our barbers in certain mental 
 characteristics He thought that it was not only his duty to guide us down those rivers and do 
 what he was paid for doing but to entertain us with stories curious and weird ancient and 
 modern strange and familiar Many of them I have forgotten and I am glad I have but there 
 is one I shall never forget 
 The old guide was leading my   along the banks of those ancient rivers and 
 he told me story after story until I grew weary of his story telling and ceased to listen I have 
 never been irritated with that guide when he lost his temper as I ceased listening But I 
 remember that he took off his Turkish cap and swung it in a circle to get my attention I could 
 see it through the corner of my eye but I determined not to look straight at him for fear he 
 would tell another story But although I am not a woman I did finally look and as soon as I 
 did he went right into another story Said he I will tell you a story now which I reserve for 
 my particular friends When he emphasized the words particular friends I listened and I 
 have ever been glad I did I really feel devoutly thankful that there are 1,674 young men who 
 have been carried through   who are also glad that I did listen 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 The old guide told me that there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient Persian by 
 the name of Ali Hafed He said that Ali Hafed owned a very large farm that he had orchards 
 grain fields and gardens that he had money at interest and was a wealthy and contented 
 man One day there visited that old Persian farmer one of those ancient Buddhist priests one 
 of the wise men of the East He sat   and told the old farmer how this old 
 world of ours was made  
 He said that this world was once a mere bank of fog and that the Almighty thrust His finger 
 into this bank of fog and began slowly to move His finger around increasing the speed until 
 at last He whirled this bank of fog into a solid ball of fire Then it went rolling through the 
 universe burning its way through other banks of fog and condensed the moisture without 
 until it fell in floods of rain upon its hot surface and cooled the outward crust Then the 
 internal fires bursting outward through the crust threw up the mountains and hills the valleys 
 the plains and prairies of this wonderful world of ours If this internal molten mass came 
 bursting out and cooled very quickly it became granite less quickly copper less quickly 
 silver less quickly gold and after gold diamonds were made Said the old priest A diamond 
 is a congealed drop of sunlight Now that is literally scientifically true that a diamond is an 
 actual deposit of carbon from the sun 
 The old priest told Ali Hafed that if he had one diamond the size of his thumb he could 
 purchase the county and if the had a mine of diamonds he could place his children upon 
 thrones through the influence of their great wealth Ali Hafed heard all about diamonds how 
 much they were worth and went to his bed that night a poor man He had not lost anything 
 but he was poor because he was discontented and discontented because he feared he was 
 poor He said I want a mine of diamonds and he lay awake all night Early in the morning 
 he sought out the priest I   a priest is very cross when awakened 
 early in the morning and when he shook that old priest out of his dreams Ali Hafed said to 
 him  
 Will you tell me where I find diamonds 
 Diamonds What do you want with diamonds 
 Why I wish to be immensely rich 
 Well then go along and find them That is all you have to do go and find them and then 
 you have them 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 But I do n’t know where to go 
 Well if you will find a river that runs through white sands between high mountains in those 
 white sands you will always find diamonds 
 I do n’t believe there is any such river 
 Oh yes there are plenty of them All you have to do is to go and find them and then you 
 have them 
 Said Ali Hafed I will go 
 So he sold his farm collected his money left his family in charge of a neighbor and away he 
 went in search of diamonds He began his search very properly to my mind at the Mountains 
 of the Moon Afterward he came around into Palestine then wandered on into Europe and at 
 last when his money was all spent and he was in rags wretchedness and poverty he stood 
 on the shore of that bay at Barcelona in Spain when a great tidal wave came rolling in 
 between the pillars of Hercules and the poor afflicted suffering dying man could not resist 
 the awful temptation to cast himself into that incoming tide and he sank beneath its foaming 
 crest never to rise in this life again 
 Then after that old guide had told me that awfully sad story he stopped the camel I was 
 riding on and went back to fix the baggage that was coming off another camel and I had an 
 opportunity to muse over his story while he was gone I remember saying to myself Why did 
 he reserve that story for his particular friends There seemed to be no beginning no middle 
 no end nothing to it  
 That was the first story I had ever heard told in my life and would be the first one I ever 
 read in which the hero was killed in the first chapter I had but one chapter of that story and 
 the hero was dead When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel he went 
 right ahead with the story into the second chapter just as though there had been no break 
 The man who purchased Ali Hafed ’s farm one day led his camel into the garden to drink and 
 as that camel put its nose into the shallow water of that garden brook Ali Hafed ’s successor 
 noticed a curious flash of light from the white sands of the stream He pulled out a black stone 
 having an eye of light reflecting all the hues of the rainbow He took the pebble into the house 
 and put it on the mantel which covers the central fires and forgot all about it 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 A few days later this same old priest came in to visit Ali Hafed ’s successor and the moment 
 he opened that drawing room door he saw that flash of light on the mantel and he rushed up 
 to it and shouted  
 Here is a diamond Has Ali Hafed returned 
 Oh no Ali Hafed has not returned and that is not a diamond That is nothing but a stone we 
 found right out here in our own garden 
 But said the priest I tell you I know a diamond when I see it I know positively that is a 
 diamond  
 Then together they rushed out into that old garden and stirred up the white sands with their 
 fingers and lo There came up other more beautiful and valuable gems then the first Thus 
 said the guide to me was discovered the diamond mine of Golconda the most magnificent 
 diamond mine in all the history of mankind excelling the Kimberly itself The Kohinoor and 
 the Orloff of the crown jewels of England and Russia the largest on earth came from that 
 mine 
 When that old Arab guide told me the second chapter of his story he then took off his Turkish 
 cap and swung it around in the air again to get my attention to the moral Those Arab guides 
 have morals to their stories although they are not always moral As he swung his hat he said 
 to me Had Ali Hafed remained at home and dug in his own cellar or underneath his own 
 wheat fields or in his own garden instead of wretchedness starvation and  
 a strange land he would have had acres of diamonds For every acre of that old farm yes 
 every shovelful afterward revealed gems which since have decorated the crowns of 
 monarchs 
 When he had added the moral of his story I saw why he reserved it for his particular friends 
 But I did not tell him that I could see it It was that mean old Arab ’s way of going around a 
 thing like a lawyer to say indirectly what he did not dare say directly that in his private 
 opinion there was a certain young man then traveling down the Tigris River that might better 
 be at home in America I did not tell him I could see that but I told it to him quick and I 
 think I will tell it to you 
 I told him of a man out in California in 1847 who owned a ranch He heard they had 
 discovered gold in southern California and so with a passion for gold he sold his ranch to 
 Colonel Sutter and away he went never to come back Colonel Sutter put a mill upon a 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 stream that ran through that ranch and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the 
 raceway into their home and sifted it through her fingers before the fire and in that falling 
 sand a visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were ever discovered in California 
 The man who had owned that ranch wanted gold and he could have secured it for the mere 
 taking Indeed thirty eight millions of dollars has been taken out of a very few acres since 
 then  
 About eight years ago I delivered this lecture in a city that stands on that farm and they told 
 me that a one third owner for years and years had been getting one hundred and twenty 
 dollars in gold every fifteen minutes sleeping or waking without taxation You and I would 
 enjoy an income like that if we did n’t have to pay an income tax 
 But a better illustration really than that occurred here in our town of Pennsylvania If there is 
 anything I enjoy above another on the platform it is to get one of these German audiences in 
 Pennsylvania and fire that at them and I enjoy it tonight There was a man living in 
 Pennsylvania not unlike some Pennsylvanians you have seen who owned a farm and he did 
 with that farm just what I should do with a farm if I owned one in Pennsylvania- he sold it 
 But before he sold it he decided to secure employment collecting coal oil for his cousin who 
 was in the business in Canada where they first discovered oil on this continent They dipped it 
 from the running streams at that early time So this Pennsylvania farmer wrote to his cousin 
 asking for employment You see friends this farmer was not altogether a foolish man No he 
 was not He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do Of all the simpletons the 
 stars shine on I do n’t know of a worse one than the man who leaves one job before he has 
 gotten another 
 That has especial reference to my profession and has no reference whatever to a man 
 seeking a divorce When he wrote to his cousin for employment his cousin replied I can not 
 engage you because you know nothing about the oil business   Well then the old farmer 
 said I will know and with most commendable zeal characteristic of the students of Temple 
 University he sat himself at the study of the whole subject He began away back at the 
 second day of God ’s creation when this world was covered thick and deep with that rich 
 vegetation which since has turned to the primitive beds of coal He studied the subject until he 
 found that the drainings really of those rich beds of coal furnished the coal oil that was worth 
 pumping and then he found how it came up with the living springs He studied until he knew 
 what it looked like smelled like tasted like and how to refine it Now said he in his letter to 
 his cousin I understand the oil business His cousin answered All right come on 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 So he sold his farm according to the county record for $ 833 even money no cents He 
 had scarcely gone from that place before the man who purchased the spot went out to 
 arrange for the watering of the cattle He found the previous owner had gone out years before 
 and put a plank across the brook back of the barn edgewise into the surface of the water just 
 a few inches The purpose of that plank at that sharp angle across the brook was to throw 
 over to the other bank a dreadful looking scum through which the cattle would not put their 
 noses But with that plank there to throw it all over to one side the cattle would drink below 
 and thus that man who had gone to Canada had been himself damming back for twenty three 
 years a flood of coal oil which the state geologists of Pennsylvania declared to us ten years 
 later was even then worth a hundred millions of dollars to our state a thousand millions of 
 dollars The man who owned that territory on which the city to Titusville now stands and 
 those Pleasantville valleys had studied the subject from the second day of God ’s creation 
 clear down to the present time He studied it until he knew all about it and yet he is said to 
 have sold the whole of it for $ 833 and again I say no sense 
 But I need another illustration I found it in Massachusetts and I am sorry I did because that 
 is the state I came from This young man in Massachusetts furnishes just another phase of my 
 thought He went to Yale College and studied mines and mining and became such an adept as 
 a mining engineer that he was   of the university to train students 
 who were behind their classes During his senior years he earned $ 15 a week for doing that 
 work When he graduated they raised his pay from $ 15 to $ 45 a week and offered him a 
 professorship as soon as they did he went right home to his mother If they had raised that 
 boy ’s pay from $ 14 to $ 15.60 he would have stayed and been proud of the place but when 
 they put it up to $ 45 at one leap he said Mother I wo n’t work for $ 45 a week The idea of a 
 man with a brain like mine working for $ 45 a week Let ’s go out to California and stake out 
 gold mines and silver mines and be immensely rich Said his mother Now Charlie it is just 
 as well to be happy as it is to be rich Yes said Charlie But it is just as well to be rich and 
 happy too And they were both right about it As he was an only son and she a widow of 
 course he had his way They always do 
 They sold out in Massachusetts and instead of going to California they went to Wisconsin 
 where he went into the employ of the superior Copper Mining Company at $ 15 a week again 
 but with the proviso in his contract that he should have an interest in any mines he should 
 discover for the company I do n’t believe he ever discovered a mine and if I am looking in the 
 face of any stockholder of that copper company you wish he had discovered something or 
 other I have friends who are not here because they could not afford a ticket who did have 
 stock in that company at the time this young man was employed there This young man went 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 out there and I have not heard a word from him I do n’t know what became of him and I 
 do n’t know whether he found any mines or not but I do n’t believe he ever did 
 But I do know the other end of the line He had scarcely gotten the other end of the old 
 homestead before the succeeding owner went out to dig potatoes The potatoes were already 
 growing in the ground when he bought the farm and as the old farmer was bringing in a 
 basket of potatoes it hugged very tight between the ends of the stone fence You know in 
 Massachusetts our farms are nearly all stone wall There you are obliged to be very 
 economical of front gateways in order to have some place to put the stone When that basket 
 hugged so tight he set it down on the ground and then dragged on one side and pulled on 
 the other side and as he was dragging that basket though this farmer noticed in the upper 
 and outer corner of that stone wall right next the gate a block of native silver eight inches 
 square That professor of mines mining and mineralogy who knew so much about the subject 
 that he would not work for $ 45 a week when he sold that homestead in Massachusetts sat 
 right on that silver to make the bargain He was born on that homestead was brought up 
 there and had gone back and forth rubbing the stone with his sleeve until it reflected his 
 countenance and seemed to say Here is a hundred thousand dollars right down here just for 
 the taking But he would not take it It was in a home in Newburyport Massachusetts and 
 there was no silver there all away off well I do n’t know were and he did not but somewhere 
 else and he was a professor of mineralogy 
 My friends that mistake is very universally made and why should we even smile at him I 
 often wonder what has become of him I do not know at all but I will tell you what I guess 
 as a Yankee I guess that he sits out   to night with his friends gathered 
 around him and he is saying to them something like this Do you know that man Conwell 
 who lives in Philadelphia Oh yes I have heard of him Do you know of that man Jones 
 that lives in Philadelphia Yes I have heard of him too 
 Then he begins to laugh and shakes his sides and says to his friends Well they have done 
 just the same thing I did precisely”-and that spoils the whole joke for you and I have done 
 the same thing he did and while we sit here and laugh at him he has a better right to sit out 
 there and laugh at us I know I have made the same mistakes but of course that does not 
 make any difference because we do n’t expect the same man to preach and practice too 
 As I come here to night and look around this audience I am seeing again what through these 
 fifty years I have continually seen men that are making precisely that same mistake I often 
 wish I could see the younger people and would that the Academy had been filled to night 
 with our high school scholars and our grammar school scholars that I could have them to talk 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 to While I would have preferred such an audience as that because they are most susceptible 
 as they have not gotten into any custom that they can not break they have not met with any 
 failures as we have and while I could perhaps do such an audience as that more good than I 
 can do grown up people yet I will do the best I can with the material I have I say to you that 
 you have acres of diamonds in Philadelphia right where you now live Oh but you will say 
 you can not know much about your city if you think there are any acres of diamonds here 
 I was greatly interested in that account in the newspaper of the young man who found that 
 diamond in North Carolina It was one of the purest diamonds that has ever been discovered 
 and it has several predecessors near the same locality I went to a distinguished professor in 
 mineralogy and asked him where he thought those diamonds came from The professor 
 secured the map of the geologic formations of our continent and traced it He said it went 
 either through the underlying carboniferous strata adapted for such production westward 
 through Ohio and the Mississippi or in more probability came eastward through Virginia and 
 up the shore of the Atlantic Ocean It is a fact that the diamonds were there for they have 
 been discovered and sold and that they were carried down there during the drift period from 
 some northern locality Now who can say but some person going down with his drill in 
 Philadelphia will find some trace of a diamond mine yet down here Oh friends You can not 
 say that you are not over one of the greatest diamond mines in the world for such a diamond 
 as that only comes from the most profitable mines that are found on earth 
 But it serves to simply to illustrate my thought which I   you do not 
 have the actual diamond mines literally you have all that they would be good for to you 
 Because now that the Queen of England has given the greatest compliment ever conferred 
 upon American woman for her attire because she did not appear with any jewels at all at the 
 late reception in England it has almost done away with the use of diamonds anyhow All you 
 would care for would be the few you would wear if you wish to be modest and the rest of you 
 would sell for money 
 Now then I say again that the opportunity to get rich to attain unto great wealth is here in 
 Philadelphia now within the reach of almost every man and woman who hears me speak to- 
 night and I mean just what I say I have not come to this platform even under these 
 circumstances to recite something to you I have come to tell you what in God ’s sight I believe 
 to be the truth and if the years of life have been of any value to me in the attainment of 
 common sense I know I am right that the men and women sitting here who found it difficult 
 perhaps to buy a ticket to this lecture or gathering to night have within their reach acres of 
 diamonds opportunities to get largely wealthy There never was a place on earth more 
 adapted than the city of Philadelphia to day and never in the history of the world did a poor 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     
 man without capital have such an opportunity to get rich quickly and honestly as he has now 
 in our city 
 I say it is the truth and I want you to accept it as such for if you think I have come to simply 
 recite something then I would better not be here I have no time to waste in any such talk 
 but to say the things I believe and unless some of you get richer for what I am saying to 
 night my time is wasted 
 I say that you ought to get rich and it is our duty to get rich How many of my pious brethren 
 say to me Do you a Christian minister spend your time going up and down the country 
 advising young people to get rich to get money Yes of course I do They say Is n’t that 
 awful Why do n’t you preach the gospel instead of preaching about man ’s making money 
 Because to make money honestly is to preach the gospel That is the reason The men who 
 get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community Oh but says some young 
 man here to night I have been told all my life that if a person has money he is very 
 dishonest and dishonorable and mean and contemptible 
 My friend that is the reason why you have none because you have that idea of people The 
 foundation of your faith is altogether false Let me say here clearly and say it briefly though 
 subject to discussion which I have not time for here ninety eight out of one hundred of the 
 rich men of America are honest That is why they are rich That is why they carry on great 
 enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them It is because they are honest men 
 Says another young man I hear sometimes of men that get millions of dollars dishonestly 
 Yes of course you do and so do I. But they are so rare a thing in fact that the newspapers 
 talk about them all the time as a matter of news until you get the idea that all the other rich 
 men got rich dishonestly 
 My friend you take and drive me if you furnish the auto out into the suburbs of 
 Philadelphia and introduce me to the people who own their homes around this great city 
 those beautiful homes with gardens and flowers those magnificent homes so lovely in their 
 art and I will introduce you to the very best people in character as well as in enterprise in our 
 city and you know I will A man is not really a true man until he owns his own home and 
 they that own their homes are made more honorable and honest and pure true and 
 economical and  home

 For a man to have money even in large sum is not an inconsistent thing We preach against 
 covetousness and you know we do in the pulpit and oftentimes preach against it so long and 
 use the terms about filthy lucre so extremely that Christians get the idea that when we 
 stand in the pulpit we believe it is wicked for any man to have money until the collection- 
 basket goes around and then we almost swear at the people because they do n’t give more 
 money Oh the inconsistency of such doctrines as that 
 Money is power and you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it You ought because you 
 can do more good with it than you could without it Money printed your Bible money builds 
 your churches money sends your missionaries and money pays your preachers and you 
 would not have many of them either if you did not pay them I am always willing that my 
 church should raise my salary because the church that pays the largest salary always raises it 
 the easiest You never knew an exception to it in your life The man who gets the largest 
 salary can do the most good with the power that is furnished to him Of course he can if his 
 spirit be right to use it for what it is given to him 
 I say then you ought to have money If you can honestly attain unto riches in Philadelphia it 
 is our Christian and godly duty to do so It is an awful mistake of these pious people to think 
 you must be awfully poor in order to be pious 
 Some men say Do n’t you sympathize with the poor people of course I do or else I would 
 not have been lecturing these years I wo nt give in but what I sympathize with the poor but 
 the number of poor who are to be with is very small To sympathize with a man whom God 
 has punished for his sins thus to help him when God would still continue a just punishment is 
 to do wrong no doubt about it and we do that more than we help those who are deserving 
 While we should sympathize with God ’s poor that is those who can not help themselves let us 
 remember that is not a poor person in the United States who was not made  
 shortcomings   of some one else It is all wrong to be poor anyhow 
 Let us give in to that argument and pass that to one side 
 A gentleman gets up back there and says Do n’t you think there are some things in this 
 world that are better than money Of course I do but I am talking about money now Of 
 course there are some things higher than money Oh yes I   that has left 
 me standing alone that there are some things in this world that are higher and sweeter and 
 purer than money Well do I know there are some things higher and grander than gold Love 
 is the grandest thing on God ’s earth but fortunate the lover who has plenty of money Money 
 is power money is force money will do good as harm In the hands of good men and women 
 it could accomplish and it has accomplished good

 I hate to leave that behind me I heard a man get up in a prayer meeting in our city and 
 thank the Lord he was one of God ’s poor Well I wonder what his wife thinks about that 
 She earns all the money that comes into that house and he smokes a part of that on the 
 veranda I do n’t want to see any more of the Lord ’s poor of that kind and I do n’t believe the 
 Lord does And yet there are some people who think in order to be pious you must be awfully 
 poor and awfully dirty That does not follow at all While we sympathize with the poor let us 
 not teach a doctrine like that 
 Yet the age is prejudiced against advising a Christian man or as a Jew would say a godly 
 man from attaining unto wealth The prejudice is so universal and the years are far enough 
 back I think for me to safely mention that years ago up at Temple University there was a 
 young man in our theological school who thought he was the only pious student in that 
 department He came into my office on evening and sat and said to me 
 Mr. President I think it is my duty sir to come in and labor with you What has happened 
 now Said he I heard you say at the Academy at the pierce School commencement that 
 you thought it was an honorable ambition for a young man to desire to have wealth and that 
 you thought it made him temperate made him anxious to have a good name and made him 
 industrious You spoke to make him a good man Sir I have come to tell you the Holy Bible 
 says that money is the root of all evil I told him I had never seen it in the Bible and 
 advised him to go out into the chapel and get the Bible and show me the place So out he 
 went for the Bible and soon he stalked into my office with the Bible open with all the bigoted 
 pride of the narrow sectarian of one who founds his Christianity on some misinterpretation of 
 Scripture He flung the Bible down on my desk and fairly squealed into my ear There it is 
 Mr. President you can read it yourself I said to him Well young man you will learn when 
 you get a little older that you can not trust another denomination to read the Bible for you You 
 belong to another denomination You are taught in the theological school however that 
 emphasis is the exegesis Now will you take that Bible and read it yourself and give the 
 proper emphasis to it 
 He took the Bible and proudly read The love of money is the root of all evil   Then he had 
 it right and when one does quote aright from that same old Book he quotes the absolute 
 truth I have lived through fifty years of the mightiest battle that old Book has ever fought 
 and I have lived to see its banners flying free for never in the history of this world did the 
 great minds of earth so universally agree that the Bible is true all true as they do at this very 
 hour 
 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     2 
 So I say that when he quoted right of course he quoted the absolute truth The love of 
 money is the root of all evil He who tries to attain unto it too quickly or dishonestly will fall 
 into many snares no doubt about that The love of money What is that It is making an idol 
 of money and idolatry pure and simple every where is   Scriptures and 
 by man ’s common sense The man that worships the dollar instead of thinking of the purposes 
 for which it ought to be used the man who idolizes simply money the miser that hordes his 
 money in the cellar or hides it in his staking or refuses to invest it where it will do the world 
 good that man who hugs the dollar until the eagle squeals has in him the root of all evil 
 I think I will leave that behind me now and answer the question of nearly all of you who are 
 asking Is there opportunity to get rich in Philadelphia Well now how simple a thing it is to 
 see where it is and the instant you see where it is it is yours Some old gentleman gets up 
 back there and says Mr. Conwell have you lived in Philadelphia for thirty one years and 
 do n’t know that the time has   can make anything in this city No I do n’t 
 think it is Yes it is I have tried it 
 What business are you in I kept a store here for twenty years and never made a thousand 
 dollars in the whole twenty years Well then you can measure the good you have been to 
 this   city has paid you because a man can judge very well what he is worth 
 by what he receives that is in what he is to the world at this time If you have not made over 
 a thousand dollars in twenty years in Philadelphia it would have been better for Philadelphia if 
 they had kicked you out of the city nineteen years and nine months ago A man has no right 
 to keep a store in Philadelphia twenty years and not make at least five hundred thousand 
 dollars even thought it be a corner grocery up town You say You can not make five 
 hundred thousand dollars in a store now Oh my friends if you will just take only four blocks 
 around you and find out what the people want and what you ought to supply them you 
 would very soon see it There is wealth right within the sound of your voice 
 Some one says You do n’t know anything about business A preacher never knows a thing 
 about business Well then I will have to prove that I am an expert I do n’t like to do this but 
 I have to do it because my testimony will not be taken if I am not an expert My father kept a 
 country store and if there is any place under the stars where a man gets all sorts of 
 experience in every kind of mercantile transactions it is in the country store I am not proud 
 of my experience but sometimes when my father was away he would leave me in charge of 
 the store thought fortunately for him that was not very often But this did occur many times 
 friends A man would come onto the store and say to me Do you keep jack knives No we 
 do n’t keep jack knives and I went off whistling a tune What did I care about that man 
 anyhow 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     3 
 Then another farmer would come in and say Do you keep jack knives No we do n’t keep 
 jack knives Then I went away and whistled another tune Then a third man came right in the 
 same door and said Do you keep jack knives No Why is every one around here asking for 
 jack knives Do you suppose we are keeping this store to supply the whole neighborhood with 
 jack knives Do you carry on your store like that in Philadelphia The difficulty was I had not 
 then learned that the foundation of godliness and the foundation principle of success in 
 business are both the same precisely 
 The man who says I can not carry my religion into business advertises himself either as 
 being an imbecile in business or on the road to bankruptcy or a thief one of the three sure 
 He will fail within a very few years He certainly will if he does n’t carry his religion into 
 business If I had been carrying on my father ’s store on a Christian plan godly plan I would 
 have had a jack knife for the third man when he called for it Then I would have actually done 
 him a kindness and I would have received a reward myself which it would have been my 
 duty to take 
 There are some over pious Christian people who think if you take any profit on anything you 
 sell that you are an unrighteous man On the contrary you would be a criminal to sell goods 
 for less than they cost You have no right to do that You can not trust a man with your money 
 who can not take care of his own You can not trust a man in your family that is not true to his 
 wife You can not trust a man in the world that does not begin with his own heart his own 
 character and his own life It would have been my duty to have furnished a jack knife to the 
 third man or to the second and to have sold it to him and actually profited myself I have no 
 more right to sell goods without making a profit on them than I have to overcharge him 
 dishonestly beyond what they are worth But I should so sell each bill of goods that the person 
 to whom I sell shall make as much as I make 
 To live and let live is the principle of the gospel and the principle of every day common 
 sense Oh young man hear me live as you go along Do not wait until you have reached my 
 years before you begin to enjoy anything of this life If I had the millions back of fifty cents of 
 it which I have tried to earn in these years it would not do me anything like the good that it 
 does me now in this almost sacred presence to night Oh yes I am paid over and over a 
 hundredfold to night for dividing as I have tried to do in some measure as I went along 
 through the years I ought not to speak that way it sounds egotistic but I am old enough 
 now to be excused for that I should have helped my fellow men which I have tried to do 
 and everyone should try to do and get the happiness of it The man who goes home with the 
 sense that he has stolen a dollar that day that he has robbed a man of what was his honest 
 due is not going home to sweet rest He arises tired in the morning and goes with an unclean 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     4 
 conscience to his work the next day He is not a successful man at all although he may have 
 laid up millions But the man who has gone through life dividing always with is fellow men 
 making and demanding his own rights and his own profits and giving to every other man his 
 rights and profits lives every day and not only that but it is the royal road to great wealth 
 The history of the thousands of millionaires shows that to be the case 
 Then man over there who said he could not make anything in a store in Philadelphia has been 
 carrying on his store on the wrong principle Suppose I go into your store to morrow morning 
 and ask Do you know a neighbor A who lives one square away at house No 1240 Oh 
 yes I have met him He deals here at the corner store Where did he come from I do n’t 
 know How many does he have in his family I do n’t know What ticket does he vote I 
 do n’t know What church does he go to I do n’t know and do n’t care What are you asking 
 all these questions for 
 If you had a store in Philadelphia would you answer me like that If so then you are 
 conducting your business just as I carried on my father ’s business in Worthington 
 Massachusetts You do n’t know where your neighbor came from when he moved to 
 Philadelphia and you do n’t care If you had cared you would  you had cared 
 enough about him to take an interest in his affairs to find out what he needed you would 
 have been rich But you go through the world saying No opportunity to get rich and there 
 is the fault right at your door  
 But another young man gets up over there and says I can not take the mercantile business 
 While I am talking of trade it applies to every occupation Why ca n't you go into the 
 mercantile business Because I have n’t any capital Oh the weak and dudish creature that 
 ca n't see over its collar It makes a person weak to see these little dudes standing around the 
 corners and saying Oh if I had plenty of capital how rich would I get Young man do you 
 think you are going to get rich on capital Certainly Well I say Certainly not If your 
 mother has plenty of money and she will set you up in business you will set her up in 
 business supplying you with capital 
 The moment a young man or woman gets more money than he or she has grown to by 
 practical experience that moment he has gotten a curse It is no help to a young man or 
 woman to inherit money It is no help to your children to leave them money but if you leave 
 them education if you leave them Christian and noble character if you leave them a wide 
 circle of friends if you leave them an honorable name it is far better than that they should 
 have money It would be worse for them worse for the nation that they should have any 
 money at all Oh young man if you have inherited money do n’t regard it as a help It will

 curse you through your years and deprive you of the very best things of human life There is 
 no class of people to be pitied so much as the inexperienced sons and daughters of the rich of 
 our generation I pity the rich man ’s son He can never know the best things in life 
 One of the best things in our life is when a young man has earned his own living and when he 
 becomes engaged to some lovely young woman and makes up his mind to have a home of 
 his own Then with that same love comes also that divine inspiration toward better things and 
 he begins to save his money He begins to leave off his bad habits and put money in the bank 
 When he has a few hundred dollars he goes out in the suburbs to look for a home He goes to 
 the savings bank perhaps for half of the value and then goes for his wife and when he 
 takes his bride over the threshold of that door for the first time he says in words of eloquence 
 my voice can never touch I have earned this home myself It is all mine and I divide with 
 thee That is the grandest moment a human heart may ever know 
 But a rich man ’s son can never know that He takes his bride into a finer mansion it may be 
 but he is obliged to go all the way through it and say to his wife My mother gave me that 
 my mother gave me that and my mother gave me this until his wife wishes she had married 
 his mother I pity the rich man ’s son 
 The statistics of Massachusetts showed that not one rich man ’s son out of seventeen ever dies 
 rich I pity the rich man ’s sons unless they have the good sense of the elder Vanderbilt which 
 sometimes happens He went to his father and said Did you earn all your money I did my 
 son I began to work on a ferry boat for twenty five cents a day Then said his son I will 
 have none of your money and he too tried to get employment on a ferry boat that 
 Saturday night He could not get one there but he did get a place for three dollars a week Of 
 course if a rich man ’s son will do that he will get the discipline of a poor boy that is worth 
 more than a university education to any man He would then be able to take care of the 
 millions of his father But as a rule the rich men will not let their sons do the very thing that 
 made them great As a rule the rich man will not allow his son to work and his mother Why 
 she would think it was a social disgrace if her poor weak little lily fingered sissy sort of a 
 boy had to earn his living with honest toil I have no pity for such rich men ’s sons 
 I remember one at Niagara Falls I think I remember one a great deal nearer I think there are 
 gentlemen present who were at a great banquet and I beg pardon of his friends 
 At a banquet here in Philadelphia there sat beside me a kind hearted young man and he said 
 Mr. Conwell you have been sick for two or three years When you go out take my limousine 
 and it will take you up to your house on Broad Street I thanked him very much and perhaps

 I ought not to mention the incident in this way but I follow the facts I got on to the seat with 
 the driver of that limousine outside and when we were going up I asked the driver How 
 much did this limousine cost Six thousand eight hundred and he had to pay the duty on 
 it Well I said does the owner of this machine ever drive it himself At that the chauffeur 
 laughed so heartily that he lost control of his machine He was so surprised at the question 
 that he ran up on the sidewalk and around a corner lamp post into the street again 
 And when he got into the street he laughed till the whole machine trembled He said He 
 drive this machine Oh he would be lucky if he knew enough to get our when we get there 
 I must tell you about a rich man ’s son at Niagara Falls I came in from the lecture to the hotel 
 and as I approached the desk of the clerk there stood a millionaire ’s son from New York He 
 was an indescribable specimen of anthropologic potency He had a skull cap on one side of his 
 head with a gold tassel in the top of it and a gold headed cane under his arm with more in it 
 than in his head It is a very difficult thing to describe that young man He wore an eye glass 
 that he could not see through patent leather boots that he could not walk in and pants that 
 he could not sit down in dressed like a grasshopper This human cricket came up to the clerk ’s 
 desk just as I entered adjusted his unseeing eye glass and spake in this wise to the clerk 
 You see he thought it was Hinglish you know to lisp Thir will you have the kindness to 
 supply me with thome papah and enwelophs The hotel clerk measured the man quick and 
 he pulled the envelopes and paper out of a drawer threw them across the counter toward the 
 young man and then turned away to his books You should have seen that young man when 
 those envelopes came across that counter 
 He swelled up like a gobbler turkey adjusted his unseeing eye glass and yelled Come right 
 back here Now thir will you order a thervant to take that papah and enwelophs to yondah 
 dethk Oh the poor miserable contemptible American monkey He could not carry paper 
 and envelopes twenty feet I suppose he could not get his arms down to do it I have no pity 
 for such travesties upon human nature If you have not capital young man I am glad of it 
 What you need is common sense not copper cents 
 The best thing I can do is to   well known to you all A.T. Stewart a 
 poor boy in New York had $ 1.50 to begin life on He lost 87½ cents of that on the very first 
 venture How fortunate that young man who loses the first time he gambles That boy said I 
 will never gamble again in business and he never did 
 
  
  
 
                       
      
      
                 
           
           
            
     7 
 How came he to lose 87½ cents You probably all know the story how he lost it because he 
 bought some needles threads and buttons to sell which people did not want and had them 
 left on his hands a dead loss Said the boy I will not lose any more money in that way 
 Then he went around first to the doors and asked the people what they did want Then when 
 he had found out what they wanted he invested his 62½ cents to supply a known demand 
 Study it wherever you choose in business in your profession in your housekeeping whatever 
 your life that one thing is the secret of success You must first know the demand You must 
 first know what people need and then invest yourself where you are most needed A.T. 
 Stewart went on that principle until he was worth what amounted afterward to forty millions 
 of dollars owning the very store in which Mr. Wanamaker carries on his great work in New 
 York His fortune was   something which taught him the great lesson that 
 he must only invest himself or his money in something that people need 
 When will you salesmen learn it When will you manufactures learn that you must know the 
 changing needs of humanity if you would succeed in life Apply yourselves all you Christian 
 people as manufactures or merchants or workmen to supply that human need It is a great 
 principle as broad as humanity and as deep as the Scripture itself 
 The best illustration I ever heard was of John Jacob Astor You know that he made the money 
 of the Astor family when he lived in New York He came across the sea in debt for his fare But 
 that poor boy with nothing in his pocket made the fortune of the Astor family on one principle 
 Some young man here to night will say Well they could make these over in New York but 
 they could not do it in Philadelphia My friends did you ever read that wonderful book of Riss 
 his memory is sweet to us because of his recent death wherein is given his statistical 
 account of the records taken in 1889 of 107 millionaires of New York If you read the account 
 you will see that out of the 107 millionaires only seven made their money in New York Out of 
 the 107 millionaires worth ten million dollars in real estate then 67 of them made their 
 money in towns of less than 3,500 inhabitants The richest man in this country to day if you 
 read the real estate values has never moved away from a town of 3,500 inhabitants 
 It makes not so much difference where you are as who you are But if you can not get rich in 
 Philadelphia you certainly can not do it in New York Now John Jacob Astor illustrated what can 
 be done anywhere He had a mortgage once on a millinery store and they could not sell 
 bonnets enough to pay the interest on his money So he foreclosed that mortgage took 
 possession of the store and went in to partnership with the very same people in the very 
 same store with the same capital He did not give them a dollar of capital They had to sell 
 goods to get any money Then he left them alone in the store just as they had been before 
 and he went out and sat down on a bench in the park in the shade What was John Jacob

 Astor doing out there and in partnership with people who had failed on his own hands Had 
 the most important and to my mind the most pleasant part of that partnership on his hands 
 For as John Jacob Astor sat on that bench he was watching the ladies as they went by and 
 where is the man who would not get rich at that business As he sat on the bench if a lady 
 passed him with her shoulders back and head up and looked straight to the front as if she 
 did not care if all the world did gaze on her then he studied her bonnet   it 
 was out of sight he know the shape of the frame the color of the trimmings and the 
 crinklings in the feather I sometimes try to describe a bonnet but not always I would not try 
 to describe a modern bonnet 
 Where is the man that could describe one This aggregation of all sorts of driftwood stuck on 
 the back of the head or the side of the neck like a rooster with only one tail feather left But 
 in John Jacob Astor ’s day there was some art about the millinery business and he went to the 
 millinery store and said to them Now put into the show window just such a bonnet as I 
 describe to you because I have already seen a lady who likes such a bonnet Do n’t make up 
 any more until I come back Then he went out and sat down again and another lady passed 
 him of a different form of a different complexion with a different shape and color of bonnet 
 Now said he put such a bonnet as that in the show window He did not fill his show- 
 window up town with a lot of hats and bonnets to drive people away and then sit on the back 
 stairs and bawl because people went to Wanamaker ’s to trade He did not have a hat or a 
 bonnet in that show window but what some lady liked before it was made up The tide of 
 custom began immediately to turn in and that has been the foundation of the greatest store 
 in New York in that line and still exists as one of three stores Its fortune was made by John 
 Jacob Astor after they had failed in business   any more money but by 
 finding out what the ladies liked for bonnets before they wasted any material in making them 
 up I tell you if a man could foresee the millinery business he could foresee anything under 
 heaven 
 Suppose I were to go through this audience to night and ask you in this great manufacturing 
 city if there are not opportunities to get rich in manufacturing Oh yes some young man 
 says there are opportunities here still if you build with some trust and if you have two or 
 three millions of dollars to begin with as capital Young man the history of the breaking up of 
 the   upon big business is only illustrating what is now the opportunity of 
 the smaller man The time never came in the history of the world when you could get rich so 
 quickly manufacturing without capital as you can now

 But you will say You can not do anything of the kind You can not start without capital Young 
 man let me illustrate for a moment I must do it It is my duty to every young man and 
 woman because we are all going into business very soon on the same plan Young man 
 remember if you know what people need you have gotten more knowledge of a fortune than 
 any amount of capital can give you 
 There was a poor man out of work living in Hingham Massachusetts He lounged around the 
 house until one day his wife told him to get out and work and as he lived in Massachusetts 
 he obeyed his wife He went out and sat down on the shore of the bay and whittled a soaked 
 shingle into a wooden chain His children that evening quarreled over it and he whittled a 
 second one to keep peace While he was whittling the second one a neighbor came in and 
 said Why do n’t you whittle toys and sell them You could make money doing that Oh he 
 said I would not know what to make Why do n’t you ask your own children right here in 
 your own house what to make What is the use of trying that said the carpenter My 
 children are different from other people ’s children I used to see people like that when I 
 taught school But he acted upon the hint and the next morning when Mary came down the 
 stairway he asked What do you want for a toy She begin to tell him she would like a doll ’s 
 bed a doll ’s washstand and went on with a list of things that would take him a lifetime to 
 supply So consulting his own children in his own house he took the firewood for he had no 
 money to buy lumber and whittled those strong unpainted Hingham toys that were that were 
 for so many years known all over the world Than man began to make those toys for his own 
 children and then made copies and sold them through the boot and shoe store next door He 
 began to make a little money and then a little more and Mr. Lawson in is Frenzied Finance 
 says that man is the richest man in old Massachusetts and I think it is the truth And that 
 man is worth a hundred millions of dollars to day and has been only thirty four years making 
 it on that one principle that one must judge that what his own children like at home other 
 people ’s children would like in their homes too to judge the human  
 one ’s wife or by one ’s children It is the royal road to success in manufacturing 
 Oh But you say did n’t he have any capital Yes a penknife but I do n’t know that he had 
 paid for that 
 I spoke thus to an audience in New Britain Connecticut and a lady four seats back went 
 home and tried to take off her collar and the collar button stuck in the buttonhole She threw 
 it out and said I am going to get up something better than that to put on collars Her 
 husband said After what Conwell said to night you see there is a need of an improved 
 collar fastener that is easier to handle There is a human need there is a great fortune Now 
 then get up a collar button and get rich He made fun of her and consequently made fun of

 me and that is one of the saddest things which comes over me like a deep cloud of midnight 
 sometimes although I have worked so hard for more than half a century yet how little I have 
 ever really done Notwithstanding the greatness and the handsomeness of your compliment 
 to night I do not believe there is one in ten of you that is going to make a million of dollars 
 because you are here to night but it is not my fault it is yours I say that sincerely What is 
 the use of my talking if people never do what I advise them to do When her husband 
 ridiculed her she made up her mind she would make a better collar button and when a 
 woman makes up her mind she will and does not say anything about it she does it 
 It was that New England woman who invented the snap button which you can find anywhere 
 now It was a collar button with a spring cap attached to the outer side Any of you who wear 
 modern waterproofs know the button that simply pushes together and when you unbutton it 
 you simply pull it apart That is the button to which I refer and which she invented She 
 afterward invented several other buttons and then invested in more and then was taken into 
 partnership with great factories Now that woman goes over the sea every summer in her 
 private steamship yes and takes her husband with her If her husband were to die she would 
 have money enough to buy a foreign duke or count or some such title as that at the latest 
 quotations 
 Now what is my lesson in that incident It is this I told her then though I did not know her 
 what I say to you Your wealth is too near to you You are looking right over it and she had 
 to look over it because it was right under her chin 
 I have read in the newspaper that a woman never invented anything Well that newspaper 
 ought to begin again Of course I do not refer to gossip I refer to machines and if I did I 
 might better include the men That newspaper could never appear if women had not invented 
 something Friends think Ye women think You say you can not make a fortune because you 
 are in some laundry or running a sewing machine it may be or walking before some loom 
 and yet you can be a millionaire if you will but follow this almost infallible direction 
 When you say a woman does n’t invent anything I ask Who invented the Jacquard loom that 
 wove every stitch you wear Mrs. Jacquard The printer ’s roller the printing press were 
  Who invented the cotton gin of the South that enriched our 
 country so amazingly Mrs. General Green invented the cotton gin and showed the idea to Mr. 
 Whitney and he like a man seized it Who was it that invented the sewing machine If I 
 would go to school tomorrow and ask your children they would say Elias Howe

 He was in the Civil War with me and often in my tent and I often heard him say that he 
 worked fourteen years to get up that sewing machine But his wife made up her mind one day 
 they would starve to death if there was n’t something or other invented pretty soon and so in 
 two hours she invented the sewing machine Of course he took out the patent in his name 
 Men always do that Who was it that invented the mower and the reaper According to Mr. 
 McCormick ’s confidential communication so recently published it was a West Virginia woman 
 who after his father and he had failed altogether in making a reaper and gave it up took a lot 
 of shears and nailed them together on the edge of a board with one shaft of each pair loose 
 and then wired them so that when she pulled the wire the other way it opened them and 
 there she had the principle of the mowing machine If you look at a mowing machine you will 
 see it is nothing but a lot of shears If a woman can invent a mowing machine if a woman can 
 invent a Jacquard loom if a woman can invent a cotton gin if a woman can invent a trolley 
 switch as she did and made the trolleys possible if a woman can invent as Mr. Carnegie said 
 the great iron squeezers that laid the foundation of all the steel millions of the United States 
 we men can invent anything under the stars I say that for the encouragement of the men 
 Who are the great inventors of the world Again this lesson comes before us The great 
 inventor sits next to you or you are the person yourself Oh but you will say I have never 
 invented anything in my life Neither did the great inventors until they discovered one great 
 secret 
 Do you think that it is a man with a head like a bushel measure or a man like a stroke of 
 lighting It is neither The really great man is a plain straightforward every day common- 
 sense man You would not dream that he was a great inventor if you did not see something he 
 had actually done His neighbors do not regard him so great 
 You never see anything great over your back fence You say there is no greatness among your 
 neighbors It is all away off somewhere else Their greatness is ever so simple so plain so 
 earnest so practical that the neighbors and friends never recognize it 
 True greatness is often unrecognized That is sure You do not know anything about the 
 greatest men and women I went out to write the life of General Garfield and a neighbor 
 knowing I was in a hurry and as there was a great crowd around the front door took me 
 around to General Garfield ’s back door and shouted Jim Jim And very soon Jim came to 
 the door and let me in and I wrote the biography of one of the grandest men of the nation 
 and yet he was just the same old Jim to his neighbor If you know a great man in 
 Philadelphia and you should meet him to morrow you would say How are you Sam or 
 Good morning Jim Of course you would That is just what you would do

 One of my soldiers in the Civil War had been sentenced to death and I went up to the White 
 House in Washington sent there for the first time in my life to see the President I went into 
 the waiting room and sat down with a lot of others on the benches and the secretary asked 
 one after another to tell him what they wanted After the secretary had been through the line 
 he went in and then came back to the door and motioned for me I went up to that anteroom 
 and the secretary said That is the President ’s door right over there Just rap on it and go 
 right in I was never so taken aback friends in all my life never The secretary himself 
 made it worse for me because he had told me how to go in and then went out another door 
 to the left and shut that There I was in the   the President of the 
 United States of America ’s door I had been on fields of battle where the shells did sometimes 
 shriek and the bullets did sometimes hit me but I always wanted to run I have no sympathy 
 with the old man who says I would just as soon march up into the cannon ’s mouth as eat my 
 dinner I have no faith in a man who does n’t know enough to be afraid when he is being shot 
 at I never was so afraid when the shells came around us at Antietam as I was when I went 
 into that room that day but I finally mustered the courage I do n’t know how I ever did and at 
 arm ’s length tapped on the door The man inside did not help me at all but yelled out Come 
 in and sit down 
 Well I went in and sat down on the edge of a chair and wished I were in Europe and the 
 man at the table did not look up He was one of the world ’s greatest men and was made 
  rule Oh that all the young people of Philadelphia were before me now 
 and I could say just this one thing and that they would remember it I would give a lifetime 
 for the effect it would have on our city and on civilization Abraham Lincoln ’s principle for 
 greatness can be   This was his rule Whatsoever he had to do at all he 
 put his whole mind in to it and held it and held it all there until that was all done That makes 
 men great almost anywhere He stuck to those papers at that table and did not look up at me 
 and I sat there trembling Finally when he put the string around his papers he pushed them 
 over to one side and looked over at me and a smile came over his worn face He said I am 
 a very busy man and have only a few minutes to spare Now tell me in the fewest words what 
 it is you want I began to tell him and mentioned the case and he said I have heard all 
 about it and you do not need to say any more 
 Mr. Stanton was talking to me only a few days ago about that You can go to the hotel and 
 rest assured that the President never did sign an order to shoot a boy under twenty years of 
 age and never will You can say that to his mother anyhow 
 Then he said to me How is it going in the field I said We sometimes get discouraged 
 And he said It is all right We are going to win out now We are getting very near the light

 No man ought to wish to be President of the United States and I will be glad when I get 
 through the Tad and I are going out to Springfield Illinois I have bought a farm out there 
 and I do n’t care if I again earn only twenty five cents a day Tad has a mule team and we are 
 going to plant onions 
 Then he asked me Were you brought up on a farm I said Yes in the Berkshire Hills of 
 Massachusetts He then threw his leg over the corner of the big chair and said I have heard 
 many a time ever since I was young that up there in those hills you have to sharpen the 
 noses of the sheep in order to get down to the grass between the rocks He was so familiar 
 so everyday so farmer like that I felt right at home with him at once 
 He then took hold of another roll of paper and looked up at me and said Good morning I 
 took the hint then and got up and went out After I had gotten out I could not realize I had 
 seen the President of the United States at all But a few days later when still in the city I saw 
 the crowd pass through the East   of Abraham Lincoln and when I looked at 
 the upturned face of the murdered President I felt then that the man I had seen such a short 
 time before who so simple a man so plain a man was one of the greatest men that God 
 ever raised up to lead a nation on to ultimate liberty Yet he was only Old Abe to his 
 neighbors When they had the second funeral I was invited among others and went out to 
 see that some coffin put back in the tomb at Springfield Around the tomb stood Lincoln ’s old 
 neighbors to whom he was just Old Abe  
 Of course that is all they would say Did you ever see a man who struts around altogether too 
 large to notice an ordinary working mechanic Do you think he is great He is nothing but a 
 puffed up balloon held   feet There is no greatness there Who are the great 
 men and women My attention was called the other day to the history of a very little thing 
 that made the fortune of a very poor man It was an awful thing and yet because of that 
 experience he not a great inventor or genius invented the pin that now is called the safety- 
 pin and out of that safety pin made the fortune of one of the great aristocratic families of this 
 nation 
 A poor man in Massachusetts who had worked in the nail works was injured at thirty eight 
 and he could earn but little money He was employed in the office to rub out the marks on the 
 bills and he used a rubber until his hand grew tired He then 
 tied a piece of rubber on the end of a stick and worked it like a plane His little girl came and 
 said Why you have a patent have n’t you The father said afterward My daughter told me 
 when I took the stick and put the rubber on the end that there was a patent and that was the 
 first thought of that He went to Boston and applied for his patent and every one of you that

 has a rubber tipped pencil in your pocket is now paying tribute to the millionaire All was 
 income all the way up into the millions 
 But let me hasten to one other greater thought Show me the great men and women who live 
 in Philadelphia 
 A gentleman over there will get up and say We do n’t have any great men in Philadelphia 
 They do n’t live here They live away off in Rome or St. Petersburg or London or Manayunk or 
 anywhere else but here in our town I have come now to the apex of my thought I have 
 come now to the heart of the whole matter and to the center of my struggle Why is n’t 
 Philadelphia a greater city in its greater wealth Why does New York excel Philadelphia 
 People say Because of her harbor Why do many other cities of the United States get ahead 
 of Philadelphia now There is only one answer and that is because our own people talk down 
 their own city If there ever was a community on earth that has to be forced ahead it is the 
 city of Philadelphia If we are to have a boulevard talk it down if we are going to have better 
 schools talk them down if you wish to have wise legislation talk it down talk all the 
 proposed improvements down That is the only great wrong that I can lay at the feet of the 
 magnificent Philadelphia that has been so universally kind to me I say it is time we turn 
 around in our city and begin to talk up the things that are in our city and begin to set them 
 before the world as the people of Chicago New York St. Louis and San Francisco do Oh if 
 we only could get that spirit out among our people that we can do things in Philadelphia and 
 do them well 
 Arise you millions of Philadelphians trust in God and man and believe in the great 
 opportunities that are right here not over in New York or Boston but here for business for 
 everything that is worth living for on earth There was never an opportunity greater Let us 
 talk up our won city 
 But there are two other young men here to night and that is all I will venture to say because 
 it is too late One over there gets up and says There is going to be a great man in 
 Philadelphia but never was one Oh is that so When are you going to be great When I 
 am elected to some political office Young man wo n’t you learn a lesson in the primer of 
 politics that is a prima facie evidence of littleness to hold office under our form of 
 government Great men get into office sometimes but what this country needs is men that 
 will do what we tell them to do This nation Where the people rule is 
 for the people and so long as it is then the office holder is but the servant of the people and 
 the Bible says the servant can not be greater than the master The Bible says He that is sent 
 can not be greater than Him who sent Him The people rule or should rule and if they do we

 do not need the greater men in office If the great men in America took our offices we would 
 change to an empire in the next ten years 
 I know of a great many young women now that woman ’s suffrage is coming who say I am 
 going to be President of the United States some day I believe in woman ’s suffrage and 
 there is no doubt but what is coming and I am getting out of the way anyhow I may want 
 an   myself but if the ambition of an office influences the women in their 
 desire to vote I want to say right here what I say to the young men that if you only get the 
 privilege of casting one vote you do n’t get anything that is worth while Unless you can 
 control more than one vote you will be unknown and your influence so dissipated as 
 practically not to be felt This country is not  you think it is It is governed by 
 influence It is   and the enterprises which control votes The young 
 woman that thinks she is going to vote for the sake of holding an office is making an awful 
 blunder 
 That other young man gets up and says There are going to great men in this country and in 
 Philadelphia Is that so When When there comes a great war when we get into difficulty 
 through watchful waiting in Mexico when we get into war with England over some frivolous 
 deed or with Japan or China or New Jersey or some distant country Then I will march up to 
 the cannon ’s mouth I will sweep up among the glistening bayonets I will leap into the arena 
 and tear down the flag and bear it away in triumph I will come home with stars on my 
 shoulder and hold every office in the gift of the nation and I will be great No you wo n’t 
 You think you are going to be made but remember that if you are not great 
 before you get the office you wo n’t be great when you secure it It will only be a burlesque in 
 that shape 
 We had a Peace Jubilee here after the Spanish War Out West they do n’t believe this because 
 they said Philadelphia would not have heard of any Spanish War until fifty years hence 
 Some of you saw the procession go up Broad Street I was away but the family wrote to me 
 that the tally ho coach with Lieutenant Hobson upon it stopped right at the front door and the 
 people shouted Hurrah for Hobson and if I had been there I would have yelled too 
 because he deserves much more of his country than he has ever received But suppose I go 
 into school and say Who sunk the Merrimac at Santiago and if the bys answer me

 in this house your most intelligent people and yet perhaps not one here can name the other 
 seven men 
 We ought not to so teach history We ought to teach that however humble a man ’s station 
 may be if he does his full duty in that place he is just as much entitled to the American 
 people ’s honor as is the king upon his throne But we do not so teach We are now teaching 
 everywhere that the generals do all the fighting 
 I remember that after the war I went down to see General Robert E. Lee that magnificent 
 Christian gentleman of whom both North and South are now proud as one of our great 
 Americans The general told me about his servant Rastus who was an enlisted colored 
 soldier He called him in one day to make fun of him and said Rastus I hear that all the rest 
 of your company are killed and why are you not killed Rastus winked at him and said 
 ’Cause when there is any fightin goin’ on I stay back with the generals 
 I remember another illustration I would leave it out but for the fact that when you go to the 
 library to read this lecture you will find this has been printed in it for twenty five years I shut 
 my eyes shut them close and lo I see the faces of my youth Yes they sometimes say to me 
 You hair is not white you are working night and day without seeming ever to stop you ca n't 
 be old But when I shut my eyes like any other man of my years oh then come trooping 
 back the faces of the loved and lost of long ago and I know whatever men may say it is 
 evening time 
 I shut my eyes now and look back to my native town in Massachusetts and I see the cattle- 
 show ground on the mountain top I can see the horse sheds there I can see the 
 Congregational church see the town hall and mountaineers cottages see a great assembly 
 of people turning out dressed resplendently and I can see flags flying and handkerchiefs 
 waving and hear bands playing I can see that company of soldiers that had re enlisted 
 marching up on that cattle show ground I was but a boy but I was captain of that company 
 and puffed out with pride A cambric needle would have burst me all to pieces Then I thought 
 it was the greatest event that ever came to man on earth If you have ever thought you would 
 like to be king or queen you go and be  
 The bands played and all the people turned out to receive us I marched up that Common so 
 proud at the head of my troops and we turned down into the town hall Then they seated my 
 soldiers down the center aisle and I sat down on the front seat A great assembly of people a 
 hundred or two came in to fill the town hall so that they stood up all around Then the town 
 officers came in and formed a half circle The mayor of the town sat in the middle of the

 platform He was a man who had never held office before but he was a good man and his 
 friends have told me that I might use this without giving them offense 
 He was a good man but he thought an office made a man great He came up and took his 
 seat adjusted his powerful spectacles and looked around when he suddenly spied me sitting 
 there on the front seat 
 He came right forward on the platform and invited me up to sit with the town officers No 
 town officer ever took any notice of me before I went to war except to advise the teacher to 
 thrash me and now I was invited up on the stand with the town officers Oh my the town 
 mayor was then the emperor the kind of our day and our time As I came up on the platform 
 they gave me a chair about this far I would say from the front  
 When I had got seated the chairman of the Selectmen arose and came forward to the table 
 and we all supposed he would introduce the Congregational minister who was the only orator 
 in town and that he would give the oration to the returning soldiers But friends you should 
 have seen the surprise which ran over the audience when they discovered that the old fellow 
 was going to deliver that speech himself He had never made a speech in his life but he fell 
 into the same error that hundreds of other men have fallen into It seems so strange that a 
 man wo n’t learn he must speak his piece as a boy if he intends to be an orator when he is 
 grown but he seems to think all he has to do is to hold an office to be a great orator 
 So he came up to the front and brought with him a speech which he had learned by heart 
 walking up and down the pasture where he had frightened the cattle He brought the 
 manuscript with him and spread it out on the table so as to be sure he might see it He 
 adjusted his spectacles and leaned over it for a moment and marched back on that platform 
 and then came forward like this tramp tramp tramp He must have studied the subject a 
 great deal then you come to think of it because he assumed an elocutionary attitude He 
 rested heavily upon his left heel threw back his shoulders slightly advanced the right foot 
 opened the organs of speech and advanced his right foot at an angle of forty five As he 
 stood in that elocutionary attitude friends this is just the way that speech went Some people 
 say to me Do n’t you exaggerate That would be impossible But I am here for the lesson 
 and not for the story and this is the way it went Fellow citizens""- As soon as he heard his 
 voice his fingers began to go like that his knees begin to shake and then he trembled all 
 over He choked and swallowed and came around to the table to look at the manuscript Then 
 he gathered himself up with clenched fists and came back Fellow citizens we are Fellow- 
 citizens we are we are we are we are we are we are very happy we are very happy we are 
 very happy We are very happy to welcome back to their native town these soldiers who have

 especially we are especially We are especially pleased to see with us to day this young hero 
 that meant me)-“this young hero who in imagination friends remember he said that if he 
 had not said in imagination I would have not be egotistic enough to refer to it at all)- this 
 young hero who in imagination we have seen leading we have seen leading leading We have 
 seen leading his troops on the deadly breach We have seen his shining we have seen his 
 shining his shining his shining sword flashing Flashing in the sunlight as he shouted to his 
 troops Come on 
 Oh dear dear dear How little that good man knew about war If he had known anything 
 about war at all he ought to have now that any of my G. A. R. comrades here to night will tell 
 you is true that it is next to a crime for an officer of infantry ever in time of danger to go 
 ahead of his men I with my shining sword flashing in the sunlight shouting to my troops 
 Come on I never did it Do you suppose I would get in front of my men to be shot in front 
 by the enemy and in the   men That is no place for an officer The place for 
 the officer in actual battle is behind the line How often as a staff officer I rode down the line 
 when our men were suddenly called to the line of a battle and the Rebel yells were coming 
 out of the woods and shouted Officers to the rear Officers to the rear 
 Then every officer gets behind the line of private soldiers and the higher the officer ’s rank the 
 farther behind he goes Not because he is any less brave but because the laws of war require 
 that 
 And yet he shouted I with my shining sword- In that house there sat the company of my 
 soldiers who had carried that boy across the Carolina rivers that he might not wet his feet 
 Some of them had gone far out to wet his feet Some of them had gone far out to get a pig or 
 a chicken Some of them had gone to death under the shell swept pines in the mountains of 
 Tennessee yet in the good man ’s speech they were scarcely known He did refer to them but 
 only incidentally The hero of the hour was this boy Did the nation own him anything No 
 nothing then and nothing now Why was he the hero Simply because that man fell into that 
 same human error that this boy was great because he was an officer and these were only 
 private soldiers 
 Oh I learned the lesson then that I will never forget so long as the tongue of the bell of time 
 continues to swing for me Greatness consists not in the holding of some future office but 
 really consists in doing great deeds with little means and the accomplishment of vast purposes 
 from the private ranks of life To be great at all one must be great here now in Philadelphia

51,Woodrow Wilson,Address in Support of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference Abridged,1919," 
 
 It gives me pleasure to add to this formal reading of the result of our labors that the character 
 of the discussion which occurred at the sittings of the commission was not only of the most 
 constructive but of the most encouraging sort It was obvious throughout our discussions that 
 although there were subjects upon which there were individual differences of judgment with 
 regard to the   objects should be obtained there was practically at no 
 point any serious differences of opinion or motive as to the objects which we were seeking 
 Indeed while these debates were not made the opportunity for the expression of enthusiasm 
 and sentiments I think the other members of the commission will agree with me that there 
 was an undertone of high respect and of enthusiasm for the thing we were trying to do which 
 was heartening throughout everything 
 Because we felt that in a way this conference did entrust into us the expression of one of its 
 highest and most important purposes to see to it that the concord of the world in the future 
 with regard to the objects of justice should not be subject to doubt or uncertainty that the 
 cooperation of the great body of nations should be assured in the maintenance of peace upon 
 terms of honor and of international obligations 
  
  
 
                       
       
       
                                
 The compulsion of that task was constantly upon us and at no point was there shown the 
 slightest desire to do anything but suggest the best means to accomplish that great object 
 There is very great significance therefore in the fact that the result was reached 
 unanimously 
 Fourteen nations were represented among them all of those powers which for convenience 
 we have called the Great Powers and among the rest a representation of the greatest variety 
 of circumstances and interests 
 So that I think we are justified in saying that the significance of the result therefore has the 
 deepest of all meanings the union of wills in a common purpose a union of wills which can not 
 be resisted and which I dare say no nation will run the risk of attempting to resist 
 Now as to the character of the document While it has consumed some time to read this 
 document I think you will see at once that it is very simple and in nothing so simple as in the 
 structure which it suggests for a league of nations a body of delegates an executive council 
 and a permanent secretariat 
 When it came to the question of determining the character of the representation in the Body 
 of Delegates we were all aware of a feeling which is current throughout the world 
 Inasmuch as I am stating it in the presence of the official representatives of the various 
 governments here present including myself I may say that there is a universal feeling that 
 the world can not rest satisfied with merely official guidance There has reached us through 
 many channels the feeling that if the deliberating body of the League of Nations was merely to 
 be a body of officials representing the various governments the peoples of the world would 
 not be sure that some of the mistakes which preoccupied officials had admittedly made might 
 not be repeated 
 It was impossible to conceive a method or an assembly so large and various as to be really 
 representative of the great body of the peoples of the world because as I roughly reckon it 
 we represent as we sit around this table more than 1.2 billion people 
 You can not have a representative assembly of 1.2 billion people but if you leave it to each 
 government to have if it pleases one or two or three representatives though only with a 
 single vote it may vary its representation from time to time not only but it may originate 
 the choice of its several representatives wireless here unintelligible 
  
  
 
                       
       
       
                                
 Therefore we thought that this was a proper and a very prudent concession to the practically 
 universal opinion of plain men everywhere that they wanted the door left open to a variety of 
 representation instead of being confined to a single official body with which they could or 
 might not find themselves in sympathy 
 And you will notice that this body has unlimited rights of discussion I mean of discussion of 
 anything that falls within the field of international relations and that it is especially agreed 
 that war or international misunderstandings or anything that may lead to friction or trouble is 
 everybody 's business because it may affect the peace of the world 
 And in order to safeguard the popular power so far as we could of this representative body it 
 is provided you will notice that when a subject is submitted it is not to arbitration but to 
  Council it can upon the initiative of either of the parties to the 
 dispute be drawn out of the Executive Council on the larger form of the general Body of 
 Delegates because through this instrument we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one 
 great force and this is the moral force of the public opinion of the world the pleasing and 
 clarifying and compelling influences of publicity so that intrigues can no longer have their 
 coverts so that designs that are sinister can at anytime be drawn into the open so that those 
 things that are   may be promptly   light 
 of the universal expression of the condemnation of the world 
 Armed force is in the background in this program but it is in the background and if the 
 moral force of the world will not suffice the physical force of the world shall But that is the 
 last resort because this is intended as a constitution of peace not as a league of war 
 The simplicity of the document seems to me to be one of its chief virtues because speaking 
 for myself I was unable to see the variety of circumstances with which this League would 
 have to deal I was unable therefore to plan all the machinery that might be necessary to 
 meet the differing and unexpected contingencies Therefore I should say of this document 
 that it is not a straitjacket but a vehicle of life 
 A living thing is born and we must see to it what clothes we put on it It is not a vehicle of 
 power but a vehicle in which power may be varied at the discretion of those who exercise it 
 and in accordance with the changing circumstances of the time And yet while it is elastic 
 while it is general in its terms it is definite in the one thing that we were called upon to make 
 definite 
  
  
 
                       
       
       
                                
 It is a definite guaranty of peace It is a definite   aggression It is a 
 definite guaranty against the things which have just come near bringing the whole structure of 
 civilization into ruin 
 Its purposes do not for a moment lie vague Its purposes are declared and its powers are 
 unmistakable It is not in contemplation that this should be merely a league to secure the 
 peace of the world it is a league which can be used for cooperation in any international 
 matter 
 That is the significance of the provision introduced concerning labor There are many 
 ameliorations of labor conditions which can be   discussion I 
 anticipate that there will be a very great usefulness in the Bureau of Labor which it is 
 contemplated shall be set  
 Men and women and children who work have been in the background through long ages and 
 sometimes seemed to be forgotten while governments have had their watchful and suspicious 
 eyes upon the maneuvers of one another while the thought of statesmen has been about 
 structural action and the larger transactions of commerce and of finance 
 Now if I may believe the picture which I see there comes into the foreground the great body 
 of the laboring people of the world the men and women and children upon whom the great 
 burden of sustaining the world must from day to day fall whether we wish it to do so or not 
 people who go to bed tired and wake up without the stimulation of lively hope These people 
 will be drawn into the field of international consultation and help and will be among the wards 
 of the combined governments of the world This is I take leave to say a very great step in 
 advance in the mere conception of that 
 Then as you will notice there is an imperative article concerning the publicity of all 
 international agreements Henceforth no member of the League can call any agreement valid 
 which it has not registered with the secretary general in whose office of course it will be 
 subject to the examination of any body representing a member of the League And the duty is 
 laid upon the secretary general to earliest possible time 
 I suppose most persons who have not been conversant with the business of foreign affairs do 
 not realize how many hundreds of these agreements are made in a single year and how 
 difficult it might be to publish the more unimportant of them immediately How uninteresting 
 it would be to most of the world to publish them immediately but even they must be 
 published just as soon as it is possible for the secretary general to publish them 
  
  
 
                       
       
       
                                
 There has been no greater advance than this gentlemen If you look back upon the history of 
 the world you will see how helpless peoples have too often been a prey to powers that had no 
 conscience in the matter It has been one of the many distressing revelations of recent years 
 that the great power which has just been happily defeated put intolerable burdens and 
 injustices upon the helpless people of some of the colonies which it annexed to itself that its 
 interest was rather their extermination than their development that the desire was to possess 
 their land for European purposes and not to enjoy their confidence in order that mankind 
 might be lifted in these places to the next higher level 
 Now the world expressing its conscience in law says there is an end of that that our 
 consciences shall be settled to this thing States will be picked out which have already shown 
 that they can exercise a conscience in this matter and under their tutelage the helpless 
 peoples of the world will come into a new light and into a new hope 
 So I think I can say of this document that it is at one and the same time a practical document 
 and a humane document There is a pulse of sympathy in it There is a compulsion of 
 conscience throughout it It is practical and yet it is intended to purify to rectify to elevate 
 And I want to say that so far as my observation instructs me this is in one sense a belated 
 document I believe that the conscience of the world has long been prepared to express itself 
 in some such way We are not just now discovering our sympathy for these people and our 
 interest in them We are simply expressing it for it has long been felt and in the 
 administration of the affairs of more than one of the great States represented here so far as 
 I know of all the great States that are represented here that humane impulse has already 
 expressed itself in their dealings with their colonies whose peoples were yet at a low stage of 
 civilization 
 We have had many instances of colonics lifted into the sphere of complete self government 
 This is not the discovery of a principle It is the universal application of a principle It is the 
 agreement of the great nations which have tried to   in their separate 
 administrations to unite in seeing that their common force and their common thought and 
 intelligence are lent to this great and humane enterprise I think it is an occasion therefore 
 for the most profound satisfaction that this humane decision should have been reached in a 
 matter for which the world has long been waiting and until a very recent period thought that it 
 was still too early to hope 
 
  
  
 
                       
       
       
                                
 Many terrible things have come out of this war gentlemen but some very beautiful things 
 have come out of it Wrong has been defeated but the rest of the world has been more 
 conscious than it ever was before of the majesty of right People that were suspicious of one 
 another can now live as friends and comrades in a single family and desire to do so The 
 miasma of distrust of intrigue is cleared away Men are looking eye to eye and saying We 
 are brothers and have a common purpose We did not realize it before but now we do realize 
 it and this is our covenant of fraternity and of friendship",0.0026400301139801,0.0064712367020547,0.0013603967381641,0.9680896401405334,0.0154531961306929,0.0044568167068064,0.0015286697307601,0.1006459634513069,0.5108269995483735,38.22115019652708,0.3187772925764192,0.0028056112224448897,0.08639308855291576,0.05780095610604085,36.15942028985507,1.0
52,General Douglas MacArthur,Sylvanus Thayer Award Acceptance Address,1962," 
 
 
 General Westmoreland General Grove distinguished guests and gentlemen of the Corps 
 As I was leaving the hotel this morning a doorman asked me Where are you bound for 
 General And when I replied West Point he remarked Beautiful place Have you ever 
 been there before 
 No human being could fail to be deeply   tribute as this Thayer Award 
 Coming from a profession I have served so long and a people I have loved so well it fills me 
 with an emotion I can not express But this award is not intended primarily to honor a 
 personality but to symbolize a great moral code the code of conduct and chivalry of those 
 who guard this beloved land of culture and ancient descent That is the animation of this 
 medallion For all eyes and for all time it is an expression of the ethics of the American 
 soldier That I should be integrated in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride 
 and yet of humility which will be with me always 
 
  
  
 
                     
                
                
                  
        
 Duty Honor Country Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be 
 what you can be what you will be They are your rallying points to build courage when 
 courage seems to fail to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith to create 
 hope when hope becomes forlorn 
 Unhappily I possess neither that eloquence of diction that poetry of imagination nor that 
 brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean 
 The unbelievers will say they are but words but a slogan but a flamboyant phrase Every 
 pedant every demagogue every cynic every hypocrite every troublemaker and I am sorry 
 to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the 
 extent of mockery and ridicule 
 But these are some of the things they do They build your basic character They mold you for 
 your future roles as the custodians of the nation 's defense They make you strong enough to 
 know when you are weak and brave enough to face yourself when you are afraid They teach 
 you to be proud and unbending in honest failure but humble and gentle in success not to 
 substitute words for actions not to seek the path of comfort but to face the stress and spur 
 of difficulty and challenge to learn to stand up in the storm but to have compassion on those 
 who fall to master yourself before you seek to master others to have a heart that is clean a 
 goal that is high to learn to laugh yet never forget how to weep to reach into the future yet 
 never neglect the past to be serious yet never to take yourself too seriously to be modest so 
 that you will remember the simplicity of true greatness the open mind of true wisdom the 
 meekness of true strength 
 They give you a temper of the will a quality of the imagination a vigor of the emotions a 
 freshness of the deep springs of life a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity 
 of an appetite for adventure over love of ease They create in your heart the sense of wonder 
 the unfailing hope of what next and the joy and inspiration of life They teach you in this way 
 to be an officer and a gentleman 
 And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead Are they reliable Are they brave Are 
 they capable of victory Their story is known to all of you It is the story of the American man- 
 at arms My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many many years ago and has 
 never changed I regarded him then as I regard him now as one of the world 's noblest 
 figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless 
 His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen In his youth and strength his 
 love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give 
  
  
 
                     
                
                
                  
        
 He needs no eulogy from me or from any other man He has written his own history and 
 written it in red on his enemy 's breast But when I think of his patience under adversity of his 
 courage under fire and of his modesty in victory I am filled with an emotion of admiration I 
 can not put into words He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of 
 successful patriotism He belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the 
 principles of liberty and freedom He belongs to the present to  and by his 
 achievements In 20 campaigns on a hundred battlefields around a thousand campfires I 
 have witnessed that enduring fortitude that patriotic self abnegation and that invincible 
 determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his people From one end of the 
 world to the other he has drained deep the chalice of courage 
 As I listened to those songs from the glee club in memory 's eye I could see those 
 staggering columns of the First World War bending under soggy packs on many a weary 
 march from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn slogging ankle deep through the mire of shell- 
 shocked roads to form grimly for the attack blue lipped covered with sludge and mud 
  and rain driving home to their objective and for many to the judgment 
 seat of   God 
 I do not know the dignity of their birth but I do know the glory of their death They died 
 unquestioning uncomplaining with faith in their hearts and on their lips the hope that we 
 would go on to victory Always for them Duty Honor Country always their blood and 
 sweat and tears as we sought the way and the light and the truth 
 And 20 years after on the other side of the globe again the filth of murky foxholes the 
 stench of ghostly trenches the slime of dripping dugouts those boiling suns of relentless 
 heat those torrential rains of devastating storms the loneliness and utter desolation of jungle 
 trails the bitterness of long separation from those they loved and cherished the deadly 
 pestilence of tropical disease the horror of stricken areas of war their resolute and 
 determined defense their swift and sure attack their indomitable purpose their complete and 
 decisive victory always victory Always through the bloody haze of their last reverberating 
 shot the vision of gaunt ghastly men reverently following your password of  
 Duty Honor Country 
 The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral laws and will stand the 
 test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the uplift of mankind Its requirements 
 are for the things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong 
  
  
 
                     
                
                
                  
        
 The soldier above all other men is required to practice the greatest act of religious training 
 sacrifice 
 In battle and in the face of danger and death he discloses those divine attributes which his 
 Maker gave when he created man in his own image No physical courage and no brute instinct 
 can take the place of the Divine help which alone can sustain him 
 However horrible the incidents of war may be the soldier who is called upon to offer and to 
 give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind 
 You now face a new world a world of change The thrust into outer space of the satellite 
 spheres and missiles mark the beginning of another epoch in the long story of mankind In 
 the five or more billions of years the scientists tell us it has taken to form the earth in the 
 three or more billion years of development of the human race there has never been a more 
 abrupt or staggering evolution We deal now not with things of this world alone but with the 
 illimitable distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe We are reaching out for 
 a new and boundless frontier 
 We speak in strange terms of harnessing the cosmic energy of making winds and tides work 
 for us of creating unheard synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard 
 basics to purify sea water for our drink of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth and 
 food of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundreds of years of controlling the 
 weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold of rain and shine of space ships to 
 the moon of the primary target in war no longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy 
 but instead to include his civil populations of ultimate conflict between a united human race 
 and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy of such dreams and fantasies as to 
 make life the most exciting of all time 
 And through all this welter of change and development your mission remains fixed 
 determined inviolable it is to win our wars 
 Everything else in your professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication All other 
 public purposes all other public projects all other public needs great or small will find others 
 for their accomplishment But you are the ones who are trained to fight Yours is the 
 profession of arms   the will to win the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for 
 victory that if you lose the nation will be destroyed that the very obsession of your public 
 service must be Duty Honor Country 
  
  
 
                     
                
                
                  
        
 Others will debate the controversial issues national and international which divide men 's 
 minds but serene calm aloof you stand as the Nation 's war guardian as its lifeguard from 
 the raging tides of international conflict as its gladiator in the arena of battle For a century 
 and a half you have defended guarded and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and 
 freedom of right and justice  
 Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of government whether our 
 strength is being indulged in too  
 grown too  grown too  too corrupt by 
 crime grown too  too  too high by extremists 
 grown too violent whether our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should 
 be These great national problems are not for your professional participation or military 
 solution Your guidepost stands out like a ten fold beacon in the night 
 Duty Honor Country 
 You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national system of defense 
 From your ranks come the great captains who hold the nation 's destiny in their hands the 
 moment the war tocsin sounds The Long Gray Line has never failed us Were you to do so a 
 million ghosts in olive drab in brown khaki in blue and gray would rise from their white 
 crosses thundering those magic words 
 Duty Honor Country 
 This does not mean that you are war mongers 
 On the contrary the soldier above all other people prays for peace for he must suffer and 
 bear the deepest wounds and scars of war 
 But always in our ears ring the ominous words of Plato that wisest of all philosophers Only 
 the dead have seen the end of war 
 The shadows are lengthening for me The twilight is here My days of old have vanished tone 
 and tint They have gone glimmering through the dreams of things that were Their memory is 
 one of wondrous beauty  coaxed and   of 
 yesterday I listen vainly but with thirsty ears for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing 
 reveille of far drums beating the long roll In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns the 
 rattle of musketry the strange mournful mutter of the battlefield 
  
  
 
                     
                
                
                  
        
 But in the evening of my memory always I come back to West Point 
 Always there echoes and re echoes Duty Honor Country 
 Today marks my final roll call with you but I want you to know that when I cross the river my 
 last conscious thoughts will be of The Corps and The Corps and The Corps

53,Barbara Jordan,Statement on the Articles of Impeachment,1974," 
 
 
 Thank you Mr. Chairman 
 Mr. Chairman I join my colleague Mr. Rangel in thanking you for giving the junior members of 
 this committee the glorious opportunity of sharing the pain of this inquiry Mr. Chairman you 
 are a strong man and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as 
 much assistance as possible 
 Earlier today we heard the beginning of the Preamble to the Constitution of the United 
 States We the people It 's a very eloquent beginning But when that document was 
 completed on the seventeenth of September in 1787 I was not included in that We the 
 people I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton just 
 left me  through the process of amendment interpretation and court 
 decision I have finally been included in We the people 
  
  
 
                                 
 Today I am an inquisitor An hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the 
 solemnness that I feel right now My faith in the Constitution is whole it is complete it is 
 total And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the 
 subversion the destruction of the Constitution 
 Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation 
 themselves The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the 
 misconduct of public men ""1 And that 's what we 're talking about In other words the 
 jurisdiction comes from the abuse or violation of some public trust 
 It is wrong I suggest it is a misreading of the Constitution for any member here to assert 
 that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be 
 convinced that the President should be removed from office The Constitution does n't say that 
 The powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the 
 Legislature against and upon the encroachments of the Executive The division between the 
 two branches of the Legislature the House and the Senate assigning to the one the right to 
 accuse and to the other the right to judge the framers of this Constitution were very astute 
 They did not make the accusers and the judgers and the judges the same person 
 We know the nature of impeachment We 've been talking about it awhile now It is chiefly 
 designed for the President and his high ministers to somehow be called into account It is 
 designed to bridle the Executive if he engages in excesses It is designed as a method of 
 national inquest into the conduct of public men ""2 The framers confided in the Congress the 
 power if need be to remove the President in order to strike a delicate balance between a 
 President swollen with power and grown tyrannical and preservation of the independence of 
 the Executive 
 The nature of impeachment a narrowly channeled exception to the separation of powers 
 maxim   The Federal Convention of 1787 said that It limited impeachment to high crimes and 
 misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term maladministration It is to be used 
 only for great misdemeanors so it was said in the North Carolina ratification convention And 
 in the Virginia ratification convention We do not trust our liberty to a particular branch We 
 need one branch to check the other 
 No one need be afraid the North Carolina ratification convention No one need be afraid 
 that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity Prosecutions of impeachments 
 will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community said Hamilton in the 
  
  
 
                                 
 Federalist Papers number 65 We divide into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the 
 accused ""3 I do not mean political parties in that sense 
 The drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment but impeachment 
 must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term high crime[s and 
 misdemeanors Of the impeachment process it was Woodrow Wilson who said that Nothing 
 short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed 
 and effectiveness Indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction 
 but nothing else can 
 Common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons 
 Congress has a lot to do Appropriations Tax Reform Health Insurance Campaign Finance 
 Reform Housing Environmental Protection Energy Sufficiency Mass Transportation 
 Pettiness can not be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems So today we 
 are not being petty We are trying to be big because the task we have before us is a big one 
 This morning in a discussion of the evidence we were told that the evidence which purports 
 to support the allegations of misuse of the   is thin We 're told that that 
 evidence is insufficient What that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what 
 the President did know on June the 23rd 1972 
 The President did know that it was Republican money that it was money from the Committee 
 for the Re Election of the President which was found in the possession of one of the burglars 
 arrested on June the 17th What the President did know on the 23rd of June was the prior 
 activities of E. Howard Hunt which included his participation in the break in of Daniel 
 Ellsberg 's psychiatrist which included Howard Hunt 's participation in the Dita Beard ITT affair 
 which included Howard Hunt 's fabrication of cables designed to discredit the Kennedy 
 Administration 
 We were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because 
 certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the President of the United States 
 There has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any 
 additional materials from the President The committee subpoena is outstanding and if the 
 President wants to supply that material the committee sits here The fact is that on 
 yesterday the American people waited with great anxiety for eight hours not knowing 
 whether their President would obey an order of the Supreme Court of the United States 
  
  
 
                                 
 At this point I would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of the 
 actions the President has engaged in Impeachment criteria James Madison from the Virginia 
 ratification convention If the President be connected in any suspicious manner with any 
 person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him he may be impeached 
 We have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants 
 money The President had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds 
 collected for the 1972 presidential campaign We know that the President met with Mr. Henry 
 Petersen 27 times to discuss matters related to Watergate and immediately thereafter met 
 with the very persons who were implicated in the information Mr. Petersen was receiving The 
 words are If the President is connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there 
 be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person he may be impeached 
 Justice Story Impeachment is attended is intended for occasional and extraordinary 
 cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their 
 rights and rescue their liberties from violations We know about the Huston plan We know 
 about the break in of the psychiatrist 's office 
 We know that there was absolute complete direction on September 3rd when the President 
 indicated that a surreptitious entry had been made in Dr. Fielding 's office after having met 
 with Mr. Ehrlichman and Mr. Young Protect their rights Rescue their liberties from 
 violation 
 The Carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria those are impeachable who 
 behave amiss or betray their public trust ""4 Beginning shortly after the Watergate break in 
 and continuing to the present time the President has engaged in a series of public statements 
 and actions designed to thwart the lawful   Moreover 
 the President has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the Watergate case 
 which the evidence will show he knew to be false These assertions false assertions 
 impeachable those who misbehave Those who behave amiss or betray the public trust 
 James Madison again at the Constitutional Convention A President is impeachable if he 
 attempts to subvert the Constitution The Constitution charges the President with the task of 
 taking care that the laws be faithfully executed and yet the President has counseled his aides 
 to commit perjury willfully disregard the secrecy of grand jury proceedings conceal 
 surreptitious entry attempt to compromise a federal judge while publicly displaying his 
 cooperation with the processes of criminal justice A President is impeachable if he attempts 
 to subvert the Constitution 
  
  
 
                                 
 If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the 
 offenses charged here then perhaps that 18th century Constitution should be abandoned to a 
 20th century paper shredder 
 Has the President committed offenses and planned and directed and acquiesced in a course 
 of conduct which the Constitution will not tolerate That 's the question We know that We 
 know the question We should now forthwith proceed to answer the question It is reason and 
 not passion which must guide our deliberations guide our debate and guide our decision 
 I yield back the balance of my time Mr. Chairman

54,Anna Howard Shaw,The Fundamental Principle of a Republic,1915," 
 
 When I came into your hall tonight I thought of the last time I was in your city Twenty one years ago I came 
 here with Susan B. Anthony and we came for exactly the same purpose as that for which we are here 
 tonight Boys have been born since that time and have become voters and the women are still trying to 
 persuade American men to believe in the fundamental principles of democracy and I never quite feel as if it 
 was a fair field to argue this question with men because in doing it you have to assume that a man who 
 professes to believe in a Republican form of government does not believe in a Republican form of 
 government for the only thing that woman 's enfranchisement means at all is that a government which 
 claims to be a Republic should be a Republic and not an aristocracy 
 The difficulty with discussing this question with those who oppose us is that they make any number of 
 arguments but none of them have anything to do with Woman 's Suffrage they always have something to do 
 with something else therefore the arguments which we have to make rarely ever have anything to do with 
 the subject because we have to answer our opponents who always escape the subject as far as possible in 
 order to have any sort of reason in connection with what they say 
 Now one of two things is true either a Republic is a desirable form of government or else it is not If it is 
 then we should have it if it is not then we ought not to pretend that we have it We ought at least be true to 
 our ideals and the men of New York have for the first time in their lives the rare opportunity on the second 
 day of next November of making the state truly a part of the Republic It is the greatest opportunity which 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 has ever come to the men of the state They have never had so serious a problem to solve before they will 
 never have a more serious problem to solve in any future of our nation 's life and the thing that disturbs me 
 more than anything else in connection with it is that so few people realize what a profound problem they 
 have to solve on November 2 
 It is not merely a trifling matter it is not a little thing that does not concern the state it is the most vital 
 problem we could have and any man who goes to the polls on the second day of next November without 
 thoroughly informing himself in regard to this subject is unworthy to be a citizen of this state and unfit to 
 cast a ballot 
 If woman 's suffrage is wrong it is a great wrong if it is right it is a profound and fundamental principle and 
 we all know if we know what a Republic is that it is the fundamental principle upon which a Republic must 
 rise Let us see where we are as a people how we act here and what we think we are The difficulty with the 
 men of this country is that they are so consistent in their inconsistency that they are not aware of having 
 been inconsistent because their consistency has been so continuous and their inconsistency so 
 consecutive that it has never been broken from the beginning of our Nation 's life to the present time 
 If we trace our history back we will find that from the very dawn of our existence as a people men have 
 been imbued with a spirit and a vision more lofty than they have been able to live they have been led by 
 visions of the sublimest truth both in regard to religion and in regard to government that ever inspired the 
 souls of men from the time the Puritans left the old world to come to this country   ideal 
 which is the sublimest and the supremest ideal in religious freedom which men have ever known the theory 
 that a man has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience without the 
 intervention of any other man or any other group of men And it was this theory this vision of the right of the 
 human soul which led men first to the shores of this country 
 Now nobody can deny that they are sincere honest and earnest men No one can deny that the Puritans 
 were men of profound conviction and yet these men who gave up everything in behalf of an ideal hardly 
 established their communities in this new country before they began to practice exactly the same sort of 
 persecutions on other men which had been practiced upon them They settled in their communities on the 
 New England shores and when they formed their   governed their local societies 
 they permitted no man to have a voice in the affairs unless he was a member of the church and not a 
 member of any church but a member of the particular church which dominated the particular community in 
 which he happened to be 
 In Massachusetts they drove the Baptists down to Rhode Island in Connecticut they drove the 
 Presbyterians over to New Jersey they burned the Quakers in Massachusetts and ducked the witches and 
 no colony either Catholic or Protestant allowed a Jew to have a voice And so a man must worship God 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 according to the conscience of the particular community in which he was located and yet they called that 
 religious freedom they were not able to live the ideal of religious liberty and from that time to this the men 
 of this government have been following along the same line of inconsistency while they too have been 
 following a vision of equal grandeur and power 
 Never in the history of the world did it dawn upon the human mind as it dawned upon your ancestors what it 
 would mean for men to be free They got the vision of a government in which the people would be the 
 supreme power and so   men wrote such documents as were went from the 
 Massachusetts legislature from the New York legislature and from the Pennsylvania group over to the 
 Parliament of Great Britain which rang with the profoundest measures of freedom and justice They did not 
 equivocate in a single word when they wrote the Declaration of Independence no one can dream that these 
 men had not got the sublimest ideal of democracy which had ever dawned upon the souls of men 
 But as soon as the war was over and our government was formed instead of asking the question who shall 
 be the governing force in this great new Republic when they brought those thirteen little territories together 
 they began to eliminate instead of include the men who should be the great governing forces and they said 
 who shall have the voice in this great new Republic and you would have supposed that such men as fought 
 the Revolutionary War would have been able to answer that every man who has fought everyone who has 
 given up all he has and all he has been able to accumulate shall be free it never entered their minds 
 These excellent ancestors of yours had not been away from the old world long enough to realize that man is 
 of more value than his purse so they said every man who has an estate in the government shall have a 
 voice and they said what shall that estate be And they answered that a man who had property valued at 
 two hundred and fifty dollars will be able to cast a vote and so they sang The land of the free and the home 
 of the brave And they wrote into their Constitution All males who pay taxes on $ 250 shall cast a vote 
 and they called themselves a Republic and we call ourselves a Republic and they were not quite so much 
 of a Republic that we should be called a Republic yet We might call ourselves angels but that would n't 
 make us angels you have got to be an angel before you are an angel and you have got to be a Republic 
 before you are a Republic Now what did we do Before the word male in the local compacts they wrote 
 the word Church members and they wrote in the word taxpayer 
 Then there arose a great Democrat Thomas Jefferson who looked down into the day when you and I are 
 living and saw that the rapidly accumulated wealth in the hands of a few men would endanger the liberties of 
 the people and he knew what you and I know that no power under heaven or among men is known in a 
  can defend their liberties   of the ballot and so the Democratic 
 party took another step in the evolution of the Republic out of a monarchy and they rubbed out the word 
 taxpayer and wrote in the word white and then the Democrats thought the millennium had come and 
 they sang The land of the free and the home of the brave as lustily as the Republicans had sung it before 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 them and spoke of the divine right of motherhood with the same thrill in their voices and at the same time 
 they were selling mother 's   on the auction block and mothers apart from their babies 
 Another arose who said a man is not a good citizen because he is white he is a good citizen because he is 
 a man and the Republican party took out that progressive evolutionary eraser and rubbed out the word 
 white from before the word male and could not think of another word to put in there- they were all in 
 black and white rich and poor wise and otherwise drunk and sober not a man left out to be put in and so 
 the Republicans could not write anything before the word male and they had to let the little word male 
 stay alone by itself 
 And God said in the beginning It is not good for man to stand alone That is why we are here tonight and 
 that is all that woman 's suffrage means just to repeat again and again that first declaration of the Divine It 
 is not good for man to stand alone and so the women of this state are asking that the word male shall be 
 stricken out of the Constitution altogether and that the Constitution stand as it ought to have stood in the 
 beginning and as it must before this state is any part of a Republic Every citizen possessing the necessary 
 qualifications shall be entitled to cast one vote at every election and have that vote counted We are not 
 asking as our Anti Suffrage friends think we are for any of awful things that we hear will happen if we are 
 allowed to vote we are simply asking that that government which professes to be a Republic shall be a 
 Republic and not pretend to be what it is not 
 Now what is a Republic Take your dictionary encyclopedia lexicon or anything else you like and look up 
 the definition and you will find that a Republic is a form of government in which the laws are enacted by 
 representatives   Now when did the people of New York ever elect their own 
 representatives Never in the world The men of New York have and I grant you that men are people 
 admirable people as far as they go but they only go half way There is still another half of the people who 
 have not elected representatives and you never read a definition of a Republic in which half of the people 
 elect representatives to govern the whole of the people That is an aristocracy and that is just what we are 
 We have been many kinds of aristocracies We have been a hierarchy of church members than an 
 oligarchy of sex 
 There are two old theories which are dying today Dying hard but dying One of them is dying on the plains 
 of Flanders and the Mountains of Galicia and Austria and that is the theory of the divine right of kings The 
 other is dying here in the state of New York and Massachusetts and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and that 
 is the divine right of sex Neither of them had a foundation in reason or justice or common sense 
 Now I want to make this proposition and I believe every man will accept it Of course he will if he is 
 intelligent Whenever a Republic prescribes the qualifications as applying equally to all the citizens of the 
 Republic when the Republic says in order to vote a citizen must be twenty one years of age it applies to all 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 alike there is no discrimination against any race or sex When the government says that a citizen must be a 
 native born citizen or a naturalized citizen that applies to all we are either born or naturalized somehow or 
 other we are here Whenever the government says that a citizen in order to vote must be a resident of a 
 community a certain length of time and of the state a certain length of time and of the nation a certain 
 length of time that applies to all equally There is no discrimination 
 We might go further and we might say that in order to vote the citizen must be able to read his ballot We 
 have not gone that far yet We have been very careful of male ignorance in these United States 
 I was much interested as perhaps many of you in reading the Congressional Record this last winter over 
 the debate over the immigration bill and when that illiteracy clause was introduced into the immigration bill 
 what fear there was in the souls of men for fear we would do injustice to some of the people who might want 
 to come to our shores and I was much and I was much interested in the language in which the President 
 vetoed the bill when he declared   clause we would keep out of our shores a large body 
 of very excellent people I could not help wondering then how it happens that male ignorance is so much 
 less ignorant than female ignorance When I hear people say that if women were permitted to vote a large 
 body of ignorant people would vote and therefore because an ignorant woman would vote no intelligent 
 women should be allowed to vote I wonder why we have made it so easy for male ignorance and so hard 
 for female ignorance 
 When I was a girl years ago I lived in the back woods and there the number of votes cast at each election 
 depended entirely upon the size of the ballot box We had what was known as the old- tissue ballots and the 
 man who got the most tissue in was the man elected Now the best part of our community was very much 
 and they did not know what to do in order to get a ballot both safe and secret but 
 they heard that over in Australia where the women voted they had a ballot which was both safe and secret 
 so we went over there and we got the Australian ballot and we brought it here 
 But when we got it over we found it was not adapted to this country because in Australia they have to be 
 able to read their ballot Now the question was how could we adapt it to our conditions Someone 
 discovered that if you should put a symbol at the head of each column like a rooster or an eagle or a hand 
 holding a hammer that if a man has intelligence to know the difference between a rooster and an eagle he 
 will know which political party to vote for and when the ballot was adapted it was a very beautiful ballot it 
 looked like a page from Life 
 Now almost any American could vote that ballot or if she had not that intelligence to know the difference 
 between an eagle and a rooster we could take the eagle out and put in the hen Now when we take so 
 much pains to adapt the ballot to the male intelligence of the United States we should be very humble when 
 we talk about female ignorance Now if we should take a vote and the men had to read their ballot in order 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 to vote it more women could vote than men But when the government says not only that you must be 
 twenty one years of age a resident of the community and native born or naturalized those are 
 qualifications but when it says that an elector must be a male that is not a qualification for citizenship that 
 is an insurmountable barrier between one half of the people and the other half of the citizens and their rights 
 as citizens No such nation can call itself a Republic It is only an aristocracy That barrier must be removed 
 before the government can become a Republic and that is exactly what we are asking right now that the 
 last step in the evolutionary process be taken on November 2d and that this great state of New York shall 
 become in fact as it is in theory a part of a government of the  and for the people 
 Men know the inconsistencies themselves they realize it in one way while they do not realize it in another 
 because you never heard a man make a political speech when he did not speak of this country as a whole 
 as though the thing existed which does not exist and that is that the people were equally free because you 
 hear them declare over and over again on the Fourth of July under God the people rule They know it is 
 not true but they say it with a great hurrah and they repeat over and over again that clause from the 
 Declaration of Independence Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and 
 they see how they can prevent half of us from giving our consent to anything and then they give it to us on 
 the Fourth of July in two languages so if it is not true in one it will be in the other vox populi vox Dei The 
 voice of the people is the voice of God and the orator forgets that in the people 's voice there is a soprano 
 as well as a bass 
 If the voice of the people is the voice of God how are we ever going to know what God 's voice is when we 
 are content to listen to a bass solo Now if it is true that the voice of the people is the voice of God we will 
 never know what the Deity 's voice in government is until the bass and soprano are mingled together the 
 result of which will be the divine harmony Take any of the magnificent appeals for freedom which men 
 make and rob them of their universal application and you take the very life and soul out of them 
 Where is the difficulty Just in one thing and one thing only that men are so sentimental We used to 
 believe that women were the sentimental sex but they can not hold a tallow candle compared with the arc 
 light of the men Men are so sentimental in their attitude about women that they can not reason about them 
 Now men are usually very fair to each other I think the average man recognizes that he has no more right 
 to anything at the hands of the government than has every other man He has no right at all to anything to 
 which every other man has not an equal right with himself He says why have I a right to certain things in the 
 government why have I a right to life and liberty why have I a right to this or this Does he say because I 
 am a man 
 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 Not at all because I am human and being human I have a right to everything which belongs to humanity 
 and every right which any other human being has I have And then he says of his neighbor and my 
 neighbor he also is human therefore every right which belongs to me as a human being belongs to him as 
 a human being and I have no right to anything under the government to which he is not equally entitled 
 And then up comes a woman and then they say now she 's a woman she is not quite human but she is my 
 wife or my sister or my daughter or an aunt or my cousin She is not quite human she is only related to a 
 human and being related to a human a human will take care of her So we have had that care taking 
 human being to look after us and they have not recognized that women too are equally human with men 
 Now if men could forget for a minute and believe the anti suffragists say that we want men to forget that we 
 are related to them they do n't know men if for a minute they could forget our relationship and remember 
 that we are equally human with themselves then they would say yes and this human being not because 
 she is a woman but because she is human is entitled to every privilege and every right under the 
 government which I as a human being am entitled to 
 The only reason men do not see as fairly in regard to women as they do in regard to each other is because 
 they have looked upon us from an altogether different plane than what they have looked at men that is 
 because women have been the homemakers while men have been the so- called protectors in the period of 
 the world 's civilization when people needed to be protected I know that they say that men protect us now 
 and when we ask them what they are protecting us from the only answer they can give is from themselves I 
 do not think that men need any very great credit for protecting us from themselves They are not protecting 
 us from any special thing from which we could not protect ourselves except themselves Now this old time 
 idea of protection was all right when the world needed this protection but today the protection in civilization 
 comes from within and not from without 
 What are the arguments which our good Anti friends give us We know that lately they have stopped to 
 argue and call suffragists all sorts of creatures If there is anything we believe that we do not believe we 
 have not heard about them so the cry goes out of this the cry of the infant 's mind the cry of a little child 
 The anti suffragists cries are all the cries of little children who are afraid of the unborn and are forever 
 crying The goblins will catch you if you do n't watch out So that anything that has not been should not be 
 and all that is right when as a matter of fact if the world believed that we would be in a static condition and 
 never move except back like a crab And so the cry goes on 
 When suffragists are feminists and when I ask what that is no one is able to tell me I would give anything to 
 know what a feminist is They say would you like to be a feminist If I could find out I would you either have 
 to be masculine or feminine and I prefer feminine Then they cry that we are socialists and anarchists Just 
 how a human can be both at the same time I really do not know If I know what socialism means it means 
 absolute government and anarchism means no government at all So we are feminists socialists 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 anarchists and Mormons or spinsters Now that is about the list I have not heard the last speech Now as a 
 matter of fact as a unit we are nothing as individuals we are like all other individuals 
 We have our theories our beliefs but as suffragists we have but one belief but one principle but one 
 theory and that is the right of a human being to have a voice in the government under which he or she lives 
 on that we agree if on nothing else Whether we agree or not on religion or politics we are concerned A 
 clergyman asked me the other day By the way what church does your official board belong to I said I 
 do n't know He said Do n't you know what religion your official board believes 
 I said Really it never occurred to me but I will missing text them up and see they are not elected to my 
 board because they believe in any particular church We had no concern either as to what we believe as 
 religionists or as to what we believe as women in regard to theories of government except that one 
 fundamental theory in the right of democracy We do not believe in this fad or the other but whenever any 
 question is to be settled in any community then the people of that community shall settle that question the 
 women people equally with the men people That is all there is to it and yet when it comes to arguing our 
 case they bring up all sorts of arguments and the beauty of it is they always answer all their own 
 arguments They never make an argument but they answer it When I was asked to answer one of their 
 debates I said What is the use Divide up their literature and let them destroy themselves 
 I was followed up last married woman from New Jersey She left her husband home for 
 three months to tell the women that their place was at home and that they could not leave home long 
 enough to go to the ballot box and she brought all her arguments out in pairs and backed them up by 
 statistics The anti suffragists can gather more statistics than any other person I ever saw and there is 
 nothing so sweet and calm as when they say You can not deny this because here are the figures and 
 figures never lie Well they do n't but some liars figure 
 When they start out they always begin the same She   it was no use to give the 
 women the ballot because if they did have it they would not use it and she had statistics to prove it If we 
 would not use it then I really can not see the harm of giving it to us we would not hurt anybody with it and 
 what an easy way for you men to get rid of us No more suffrage meetings never any nagging you again no 
 one could blame you for anything that went wrong with the town if it did not run right all you would have to 
 say is you have the power why do n't you go ahead and clean up 
 Then the young lady unfortunately for her first argument  which she had many the 
 awful results which happened where women did have the ballot what awful laws have been brought about 
 by women 's vote the conditions that prevail in the homes and how deeply women get interested in politics 
 because women are hysterical and we can not think of anything else we just forget our families cease to 
 care for our children cease to love our husbands and just go to the polls and vote and keep on voting for 
  
  
 
                                               
 
 ten hours a day 365 days in the year never let up if we ever get to the polls once you will never get us 
 home so that the women will not vote at all and they will not do anything but vote Now these are two very 
 strong anti suffrage arguments and they can prove  they will tell you that if women are 
 permitted to vote it will be a great expense and no use because wives will vote just as their husbands do 
 even if we have no husbands that would not effect the result because we would vote just as our husbands 
 would vote if we had one How I wish the anti suffragists could make the men believe that if they could 
 make men believe that the women would vote just as they wanted them to do you think we would ever have 
 to make another speech or hold another meeting we would have to vote whether we wanted to or not 
 And then the very one who will tell you that women will vote just as their husbands do will tell you in five 
 minutes that they will not vote as their husbands will and then the discord in the homes and the divorce 
 Why they have discovered that in Colorado there are more divorces than there were before women began 
 to vote but they have forgotten to tell you that there are four times as many people in Colorado today as 
 there were when women began to vote and that may have some effect particularly as these people went 
 from the East Then they will tell you all the trouble that happens in the home 
 A gentleman told me that in California missing text and when he was talking I had a wonderful thing pass 
 through my mind because he said that he and his wife had lived together for twenty years and never had a 
 difference in opinion in the whole twenty years and he was afraid if women began to vote that his wife would 
 vote differently from him and then that beautiful harmony which they had had for twenty years would be 
 broken and all the time he was talking I could not help wondering which was the idiot because I knew that 
 no intelligent human beings could live together for twenty years and not have a differences of opinion 
 All the time he was talking I looked at that splendid type of manhood and thought how would a man feel 
 being tagged   woman for twenty years saying Me too me too I would not want to live in a 
 house with a human being for twenty years who agreed with everything I said The stagnation of a frog pond 
 would be hilarious compared to that What a reflection is that on men If we should say that about men we 
 would never hear the last of it Now it may be that the kind of men being that the anti suffragists live with is 
 that kind but they are not the kind we live with and we could not do it Great big overgrown babies Can not 
 be disputed without having a row While we do not believe that men are  we do 
 believe that the average American man is a fairly good sort of fellow 
 In fact my theory of the whole matter is exactly opposite because instead of believing that men and women 
 will quarrel I think just the opposite thing will happen I think just about six weeks before election a sort of 
 honeymoon will start and it will continue until they will think they are again hanging over the gate all in order 
 to get each other 's votes When men want each other 's votes they do not go up and knock them down they 
 are very solicitous of each other if they are thirsty or need a smoke or missing text well we do n't worry 
 about home The husband and wife who are quarreling after the vote are quarreling now

 Then the other belief that the women would not vote if they had a vote and would not do anything else and 
 would vote just as their husbands vote and would not vote like their husbands that women have so many 
 burdens that they can not bear another burden and that women are the leisure class 
 I remember having Reverend Dr. Abbott speak before the anti suffrage meeting in Brooklyn and he stated 
 that if women were permitted to vote we would not have so much time for charity and philanthropy and I 
 would like to say Thank God there will not be so much need of charity and philanthropy The end and aim 
 of the suffrage is not to furnish an opportunity for excellent old ladies to be charitable There are two words 
 that we ought to be able to get along without and they are charity and philanthropy They are not needed in 
 a Republic If we put in the word opportunity instead that is what Republics stand for 
 Our doctrine is not to extend the length of our bread lines or the size of our soup kitchens what we need is 
 for men to have the opportunity to buy their own bread and eat their own soup We women have used up 
 our lives and strength in fool charities and we have made more paupers than we have ever helped by the 
 folly of our charities and philanthropies the unorganized   deal with the conditions of 
 society and instead of giving people charity we must learn to give them an opportunity to develop and make 
 themselves capable of earning the bread no human being has the right to live without toil toil of some kind 
 and that old theory that we used to hear The world owes a man a living never was true and never will be 
 true This world does not owe anybody a living what it does owe to every human being is the opportunity to 
 earn a living We have a right to the opportunity and then the right to the living thereafter We want it No 
 woman any more than a man has the right to live an idle life in this world we must learn to give back 
 something for the space occupied and we must do our duty wherever duty calls and the woman herself 
 must decide where her duty calls just as a man does 
 Now they tell us we should not vote because we have not the time we are so burdened that we should not 
 have any more burdens Then if that is so I think we ought to allow the women to vote instead of the men 
 since we pay a man anywhere from a third to a half more than we do women it would be better to use up the 
 cheap time of the women instead of the dear time of the men And talking about time you would think it took 
 about a week to vote 
 A dear good friend of mine in Omaha said Now Miss. Shaw and she held up her child in her arms is not 
 this my job I said it certainly is and then she said How can I go to the polls and vote and neglect my 
 baby I said Has your husband a job and she said Why you know he has I did know it he was a 
 banker and a very busy one I said Yet your husband said he was going to leave husband and go down to 
 the polls and vote and she said Oh yes he is so very interested in election Then I said What an 
 advantage you have over your husband he has to leave his job and you can take your job with you and you 
 do not need to neglect your job Is it not strange that the only time a woman might neglect her baby is on 
 election day and then the dear old Antis hold up their hands and say You have neglected your baby A

 woman can belong to a whist club and go once a week and play whist she can not take her baby to the 
 whist club and she has to keep whist herself without trying to keep a baby whist She can go to the theatre 
 to church or a picnic and no one is worrying about the baby but to vote and everyone cries out about the 
 neglect 
 You would think on Election Day that a woman grabbed up her baby and started out and just dropped it 
 somewhere and paid no attention to it It used to be asked when we had the question missing text box 
 Who will take care of the babies I did not know what person could be got to take care of all the babies so 
 I thought I would go out West and find out I went to Denver and I found that they took care of their babies 
 just the same on election day as they did on every other day they took their baby along with them when 
 they went to put a letter in a box they took their baby along and when they went to put their ballot in the box 
 they took their baby along If the mother had to stand in line and the baby got restless she would joggle the 
 go cart and when she went in to vote a neighbor would joggle the go cart and if there was no neighbor there 
 was the candidate and he would joggle the cart That is one day in the year when you can get a hundred 
 people to take care of any number of babies I have never worried about the babies on Election Day since 
 that time  
 Then the people will tell you that women are so burdened with their duties that they can not vote and they 
 will tell you that women are the leisure class and the men are worked to death but the funniest argument of 
 the lady who followed me about in the West Out there they were great in the temperance question and she 
 declared that we were not prohibition or she declared that we were Now in North Dakota which is one of 
 the first prohibition states and they are dry because they want to be dry In that state she wanted to prove to 
 them that if women were allowed to vote they would vote North Dakota wet and she had her figures that 
 women had not voted San Francisco dry or Portland dry or Chicago dry Of course we had not voted on 
 the question in Chicago but that did not matter 
 Then we went to Montana which is wet They have it wet there because they want it wet so that any 
 argument that she could bring to bear upon them to prove that we would make North Dakota wet and keep it 
 wet would have given us the state but that would not work so she brought out the figures out of her pocket 
 to prove to the men of Montana that if women were allowed to vote in Montana they would vote Montana 
 dry She proved that in two years in Illinois they had voted ninety six towns dry and that at that rate we 
 would soon get over Montana and have it dry Then I went to Nebraska and as soon as I reached there a 
 reporter came and asked me the question How are the women going to vote on the prohibition question I 
 said I really do n't know I know how we will vote in North Dakota we will vote wet in North Dakota in 
 Montana we will vote dry but how we will vote in Nebraska I do n't know but I will let you know just as soon 
 as the lady from New Jersey comes

 We will either vote as our husbands vote or we will not vote as our husbands vote We either have time to 
 vote or we do n't have time to vote We will either not vote at all or we will vote all the time It reminds me of 
 the story of the old Irish woman who had twin boys and they were so much alike that the neighbors could 
 not tell them apart so one of the neighbors said Now Mrs. Mahoney you have two of the finest twin boys I 
 ever saw in all my life but how do you know them apart Oh she says That 's easy enough any one 
 could tell them apart When I want to know which is which I just put my finger in Patsey 's mouth and if he 
 bites it is Mikey  
 Now what does it matter whether the women will vote as their husbands do or will not vote whether they 
 have time or have not or whether they will vote for prohibition or not What has that to do with the 
 fundamental question of democracy no one has yet discovered Bu they can not argue on that they can not 
 argue on the fundamental basis of our existence so that they have to get off on all of these side tricks to get 
 anything approaching an argument So they tell you that democracy is a form of government It is not It was 
 before governments were it will prevail when governments cease to be it is more than a form of 
 government it is a great spiritual force emanating from the heart of the Infinite transforming human 
 character until some day some day in the distant future   of the spirit of democracy will be 
 able to look back into the face of the Infinite and answer as man can not answer today One is our Father 
 even God and all we people are the children of one family 
 And when democracy has taken possession of human lives no man will ask from him to grant to his 
 neighbor whether that neighbor be a man or woman no man will then be willing to allow another man to 
 rise to power on his shoulders nor will he be willing to rise to power on the shoulders of another prostrate 
 human being Bu that has not yet taken possession of us but some day we will be free and we are getting 
 nearer and nearer to it all the time and never in the history of our country had the men and women of this 
 nation a better right to approach it than they have today never in the history of the nation did it stand out so 
 splendidly as it stands today and never ought we men and women to be more grateful for anything than that 
 there presides in the White House today a man of peace 
 As so our good friends go on with one thing after another and they say if women should vote they will have 
 to sit on the jury and they ask whether we will like to see a woman sitting on a jury I have seen some juries 
 that ought to be sat on and I have seen some women that would be glad to sit on anything When a woman 
 stands up all day behind a counter or when she stands all day doing a washing she is glad enough to sit 
 and when she stands for seventy five cents she would like to sit for two dollars a day But do n't you think we 
 need some women on juries in this country

 You read your paper and you read that one day last week or the week before or the week before a little girl 
 went out to school and never came back another little girl was sent on an errand and never came back 
 another little girl was left in charge of a little sister and her mother went out to work and when she returned 
 the little girl was not there and you read it over and over again and the horror of it strikes you 
 You read that in these United States five thousand young girls go out and never come back do n't you think 
 that the men and women the vampires of our country who fatten and grow rich on the ignorance and 
 innocence of children would rather face Satan himself than a jury of mothers I would like to see some juries 
 of mothers I lived in the slums of Boston for three years and I know the need of juries of mothers  
 Then they tell us that if women were permitted to vote that they would take office and you would suppose 
 that we just took office in this country There is a difference of getting an office in this country and in Europe 
 In England a man stands for Parliament and in this country he runs for Congress and so long as it is a 
 question of running for office I do n't think women have much chance especially with our present hobbles 
 There are some women who want to hold office and I may as well own up 
 I am one of them I have been wanting to hold office for more than thirty- five years Thirty five years ago I 
 lived in the slums of Boston and ever since then I have wanted to hold office I have applied to the major to 
 be made an officer I wanted to be the greatest office holder in the world I wanted the position of the man I 
 think is to be the most envied as far as the ability to do good is concerned and that is a policeman I have 
 always wanted to be a policeman and I have applied to be appointed policeman and the very first question 
 that was asked me was Could you knock a man down and take him to jail 
 That is some people 's idea of the highest service that a policeman can render a community Knock 
 somebody down and take him to jail My idea is not so much to arrest criminals as it is to prevent crime 
 That is what is needed in the police force of every community When I lived for three years in the back alleys 
 of Boston I saw there that it was needed to prevent crime and from that day This I believe there is no great 
 public gathering of any sort whatever where we do not need women on the police force we need them at 
 every moving picture show every dance house every restaurant every hotel and every great store with a 
 great bargain counter and every park and every resort where the vampires who fatten on the crimes and 
 vices of men and women gather We need women on the police force and we will have them there some 
 day 
 If women vote will they go to war They are great on having us fight They tell you that the government 
 rests on force but there are a great many kinds of force in this world and never in the history of man were 
 the words of the Scriptures proved to the extent that they are today that the men of the nation that lives by 
 the sword shall   When I was speaking in North Dakota from an automobile with a great 
 crowd and a great number of men gathered around a man who had been sitting in front of a store whittling a

 stick called out to another man and asked if women get the vote will they go over to Germany and fight the 
 Germans I said Why no why should we go over to Germany and fight Germans If Germans come over 
 here would you fight I said Why should we women fight men but if Germany should send an army of 
 women over here then we would show you what we would do We would go down and meet them and say 
 Come on let 's go up to the opera house and talk this matter over It might grow wearisome but it would not 
 be death 
 Would it not be better if the heads of the governments in Europe had talked things over What might have 
 happened to the world if a dozen men had gotten together in Europe and settled the awful controversy 
 which is today discriminating the nations of Europe We women got together there last year over in Rome 
 the delegates from twenty eight different nations of women and for two weeks we discussed problems 
 which had like interests to us all 
 They were all kinds of Protestants both kinds of Catholics Roman and Greek three were Jews and 
 Mohamedans but we were not there to discuss our different religious beliefs but we were there to discuss 
 the things that were of vital importance to us all and at the end of the two weeks after the discussions were 
 over we passed a great number of resolutions 
 We discussed white slavery the immigration laws we discussed the spread of contagious and infectious 
 diseases we discussed various forms of education and various forms of juvenile criminals every question 
 which every nation has to meet and at the end of two weeks we passed many resolutions but two of them 
 were passed unanimously One was   Chairman on the Committee on Suffrage and 
 on that resolution we called upon all civilizations of the world to give to women equal rights with men and 
 there was not a dissenting vote 
 The other resolution was on peace We believed then and many of us believe today notwithstanding all the 
 discussion that is going on we believe and we will continue to believe that preparedness for war is an 
 incentive to war and the only hope of permanent peace is the systematic and scientific disarmament of all 
 the nations of the world and we passed a resolution and passed it unanimously to that effect 
 A few days afterward I attended a large reception   ambassador and there was an 
 Italian diplomat there and he spoke rather superciliously and said You women think you have been having 
 a very remarkable convention and I understand that a resolution on peace was the 
 French women seconded it and the British presiding presented it and it was carried unanimously We none 
 of us dreamed what was taking place at that time but he knew and we learned it before we arrived home 
 that awful awful thing that was about to sweep over the nations of the world The American ambassador 
 replied to the Italian diplomat and said Yes Prince it was a remarkable convention and it is a remarkable 
 thing that the only people who can get together internationally and discuss their various problems without

 acrimony and without a sword at their side are the women of the world but we men even when we go to the 
 Hague to discuss peace we go with a sword dangling at our side It is remarkable that even at this age 
 men can not discuss international problems and discuss them in peace 
 When I turned away from that place up in North Dakota that man in the crowd called out again just as we 
 were leaving and said Well what does a woman know about war anyway I had read my paper that 
 morning and I knew what the awful headline was and I saw a gentleman standing in the crowd with a paper 
 in his pocket and I said Will that gentleman hold the paper up And he held it up and the headline read 
 250,000 Men Killed Since the War Began I said You ask me what a woman knows about war No 
 woman can read that line and comprehend the awful horror no woman knows the significance of 250,000 
 dead men but you tell me that one man lay dead and I might be able to tell you something of its awful 
 meaning to one woman 
 I would know that years before a woman whose heart beat in unison with her love and her desire for 
 motherhood walked   her face to an open grave with courage which no man has ever 
 surpassed and if she did not fill that grave if she lived and if there was laid in her arms a tiny little bit of 
 helpless humanity I would know that there went out from her soul such a cry of thankfulness as none save 
 a mother could know And then I would know what men have not yet learned that women are human that 
 they have human hopes and human passions aspirations and desires as men have and I would know that 
 that mother had laid aside all those hopes and aspirations for herself laid them aside for her boy and if 
 after years had   her nights of sleeplessness and her days of fatiguing toil in her care of 
 her growing boy and when at last he became a man and she stood looking up into his eyes and beheld him 
 bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh for out of her woman 's life she had carved twenty beautiful years 
 that went into the making of a man and there he stands the most wonderful thing in all the world for in all 
 the Universe of God there is nothing more sublimely wonderful than a strong limbed clean hearted keen 
 brained aggressive young man standing as he does on the border line of life ready to reach out and 
 grapple with its problems 
 O how wonderful he is and he is hers She gave her life for him and in an hour this country calls him out 
 and in an hour he lies dead that wonderful wonderful thing lies dead and that mother 
 looking into the dark years to come knows that when her son died her life 's hope died with him and in the 
 face of that wretched motherhood what man dare ask what a woman knows of war And that is not all 
 Read your papers you can not read it because it is not printable you can not tell it because it is not 
 speakable you can not even think it because it is not thinkable the horrible crimes perpetrated against 
  drunken men of the war

 You read your paper again and the second headlines read It Costs Twenty Millions of Dollars a Day for 
 what To buy the material to slaughter the splendid results of civilization of the centuries Men whom it has 
 taken centuries to build up and make into great scientific forces of brain the flower of the manhood of the 
 great nations of Europe and we spend twenty millions of dollars a day to blot out all the results of civilization 
 of hundreds and hundreds of years And what do we do We lay a mortgage on every unborn child for a 
 hundred and more years to come Mortgage his brain his brawn and every pulse of his heart in order to 
 pay the debt to buy the material to slaughter the men of our country 
 And that is not all the greatest crime of war is the crime against the unborn Read what they are doing 
 They are calling out every man every young man and every virile man from seventeen to forty five or fifty 
 years old they are calling them out All the splendid scientific force and energy of the splendid virile 
 manhood are being called out to be food for the cannon and they are leaving behind the degenerate 
 defective imbecile the unfit the criminals the diseased to be the fathers of children yet to be born The 
 crime of crimes of the war is the crime against the unborn children and in the face of the fact that women 
 are driven out of the home shall men ask if women shall fight if they are permitted to vote 
 No we women do not want the ballot in order that we may fight but we do want the ballot in order that we 
 may help men to keep from fighting whether it is in the home or in the state just as the home is not without 
 the man so the state is not without the woman and you can no more build up homes without men than you

55,Ronald Reagan,Remarks at the Brandenburg Gate,1987," 
 
 
 Thank you Thank you very much  
 Chancellor Kohl Governing Mayor Diepgen ladies and gentlemen Twenty four years ago 
 President John F. Kennedy visited Berlin and speaking to the people of this city and the world 
 at the city hall Well since then two other presidents have come each in his turn to Berlin 
 And today I myself make my second visit to your city 
 We come to Berlin we American Presidents because it 's our duty to speak in this place of 
 freedom But I must confess we ’re drawn   as  of 
 history in this city more than 500 years older than our own  of the 
 Grunewald and the Tiergarten most of  and determination Perhaps the 
 composer Paul Linke understood something about American Presidents You see like so 
 many Presidents before me I come here today because wherever I go whatever I do Ich 
 hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin I still have a suitcase in Berlin 
 Our gathering today is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North America I 
 understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East 
  
  
 
                                   
        
 To those listening throughout Eastern Europe I extend my warmest greetings and the good 
 will of the American people To those listening in East Berlin a special word Although I 
 can not be with you I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here 
 before me For I join you as I join your fellow countrymen in the West in this firm this 
 unalterable belief Es gibt nur ein Berlin There is only one Berlin 
 Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city part of a vast system of 
 barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe From the Baltic South those barriers cut 
 across Germany in a gash of barbed wire concrete dog runs and guard towers Farther 
 south there may be no visible no obvious wall But there remain armed guards and 
 checkpoints all the same still a restriction on the right to travel still an instrument to 
 impose upon ordinary men and women the will of a totalitarian state 
 Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly here cutting across your city 
 where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a 
 continent upon the mind of the world  
 Standing before the Brandenburg Gate every man is a German separated from his fellow 
 men Every man is a Berliner forced to look upon a scar 
 President Von Weizsäcker has said The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg 
 Gate is closed Well today today I say As long as this gate is closed as long as this scar of 
 a wall is permitted to stand it is not the German question alone that remains open but the 
 question of freedom for all mankind 
 Yet I do not come here to lament For I find in Berlin a message of hope even in the shadow 
 of this wall a message of triumph In this season of spring in 1945 the people of Berlin 
 emerged from their air raid shelters to find devastation Thousands of miles away the people 
 of the United States reached out to help And in 1947 Secretary of State as you 've been 
 told George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall 
 Plan Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month he said Our policy is directed not against 
 any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos 
 In the Reichstag a few moments ago I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of 
 the Marshall Plan I was   the sign on a burnt out gutted structure that was 
 being rebuilt I understand that Berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs 
 like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the city The sign read simply The Marshall 
 Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world A strong free world in the West that 
  
  
 
                                   
        
 dream became real Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant Italy France 
 Belgium virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth the 
 European Community was founded 
 In West Germany and here in Berlin there took place an economic miracle the 
 Wirtschaftswunder Miracle on the Rhine Adenauer Erhard Reuter and other leaders 
 understood the practical importance of liberty that just as truth can flourish only when the 
 journalist is given freedom of speech so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and 
 businessman enjoy economic freedom The German leaders the German leaders reduced 
 tariffs expanded free trade lowered taxes From 1950 to 1960 alone the standard of living in 
 West Germany and Berlin doubled 
 Where four decades ago there was rubble today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial 
 output of any city in Germany busy office blocks fine homes and apartments proud 
 avenues and the spreading lawns of parkland Where a city 's culture seemed to have been 
 destroyed today there are two great universities orchestras and an opera countless 
 theaters and museums Where there was want today there 's abundance food clothing 
 automobiles the wonderful goods of the Kudamm.1 From devastation from utter ruin you 
 Berliners have in freedom rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on 
 earth Now the Soviets may have had other plans But my friends there were a few things the 
 Soviets did n't count on Berliner Herz Berliner Humor ja und Berliner Schnauze Berliner 
 heart Berliner humor yes and a Berliner Schnauze.2 
 In the 1950s In the 1950s Khrushchev predicted We will bury you  
 But in the West today we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well- 
 being unprecedented in all human history In the Communist world we see failure 
 technological backwardness declining standards of health even want of the most basic kind 
 too little food Even today the Soviet Union still can not feed itself After these four decades 
 then there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion Freedom 
 leads to prosperity Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among nations with comity and 
 peace Freedom is the victor 
 And now now the Soviets themselves may in a limited way be coming to understand the 
 importance of freedom We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and 
 openness Some political prisoners have been released Certain foreign news broadcasts are 
 no longer being jammed Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with 
 greater freedom from state control 
  
  
 
                                   
        
 Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state Or are they token gestures 
 intended to raise false hopes in the West or to strengthen the Soviet system without 
 changing it We welcome change and openness for we believe that freedom and security go 
 together that the advance of human liberty the advance of human liberty can only 
 strengthen the cause of world peace 
 There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance 
 dramatically the cause of freedom and peace  
 General Secretary Gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union 
 and Eastern Europe if you seek liberalization Come here to this gate  
 Mr. Gorbachev open this gate  
 Mr. Gorbachev Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall 
 I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent and I pledge to 
 you my country 's efforts to help overcome these burdens To be sure we in the West must 
 resist Soviet expansion So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength Yet we seek 
 peace so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides  
 Beginning 10 years ago the Soviets challenged the Western alliance with a grave new threat 
 hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles capable of striking every capital in 
 Europe The Western alliance   to a counter deployment unless 
 the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution namely the elimination of such weapons 
 on both sides For many months the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness As the 
 alliance in turn prepared to go forward with its counter deployment there were difficult 
 days days of protests like those during my 1982 visit to this city and the Soviets later 
 walked away from the table 
 But through it all the alliance held firm And I invite those who protested then I invite 
 those who protest today to mark this fact Because we remained strong the Soviets came 
 back to the table Because we remained strong today we have within reach the possibility 
 not merely of limiting the growth of arms but of eliminating for the first time an entire class 
 of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth 
 As I speak NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for 
 eliminating these weapons At the talks in Geneva we have also proposed deep cuts in 
  
  
 
                                   
        
 strategic offensive weapons And the Western allies have likewise made far reaching proposals 
 to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons  
 While we pursue these arms reductions I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to 
 deter Soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur And in cooperation with many of 
 our allies the United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative research to base 
 deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation but on defenses that truly defend on 
 systems in short that will not target populations but shield them By these means we seek 
 to increase the safety of Europe and all the world 
 But we must remember a crucial fact East and West do not mistrust each other because we 
 are armed we are armed because we mistrust each other And our differences are not about 
 weapons but about liberty When President Kennedy spoke at the City Hall those 24 years 
 ago freedom was encircled Berlin was under siege And today despite all the pressures upon 
 this city Berlin stands secure in its liberty And freedom itself is transforming the globe 
 In the Philippines in South and Central America democracy has been given a rebirth 
 Throughout the Pacific free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth In 
 the industrialized nations a technological revolution is taking place a revolution marked by 
 rapid dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications  
 In Europe only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom Yet 
 in this age of redoubled economic growth of information and innovation the Soviet Union 
 faces a choice It must make fundamental changes or it will become obsolete 
 Today thus represents a moment of hope We in the West stand ready to cooperate with the 
 East to promote true openness to break down barriers that separate people to create a safer 
 freer world And surely there is no better place than Berlin the meeting place of East and 
 West to make a start  
 Free people of Berlin Today as in the past the United States stands for the strict observance 
 and full implementation of all parts of the Four Power Agreement of 1971 Let us use this 
 occasion the 750th anniversary of this city to usher in a new era to seek a still fuller richer 
 life for the Berlin of the future Together let us maintain and develop the ties between the 
 Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin which is permitted by the 1971 
 agreement  
  
  
 
                                   
        
 And I invite Mr. Gorbachev Let us work to bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city 
 closer together so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with 
 life in one of the great cities of the world 
 To open Berlin still further to all Europe East and West let us expand the vital air access to 
 this city finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient more 
 comfortable and more economical We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of 
 the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe  
 With With our French With our French and British partners the United States is prepared 
 to help bring international meetings to Berlin It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the 
 site of United Nations meetings or world conferences on human rights and arms control or 
 other issues that call for international cooperation 
 There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds and we 
 would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges cultural events and other programs 
 for young Berliners from the East Our French and British friends I 'm certain will do the 
 same And it 's my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from 
 young people of the Western sectors  
 One final proposal one close to my heart Sport represents a source of enjoyment and 
 ennoblement and you may have noted that the Republic of Korea South Korea has 
 offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North International 
 sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city And what better way 
 to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold 
 the Olympic games here in Berlin East and West 
 In these four decades as I have said you Berliners have built a great city You 've done so in 
 spite of threats the Soviet attempts to impose the East mark the blockade Today the city 
 thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall What keeps you 
 here Certainly there 's a great deal to be said for your fortitude for your defiant courage 
 But I believe there 's something deeper something that involves Berlin 's whole look and feel 
 and way of life not mere sentiment No one could live long in Berlin without being 
 completely disabused of illusions Something instead that has seen the difficulties of life in 
 Berlin but chose to accept them that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to 
 a surrounding totalitarian presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations 
 something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation that says yes to this city yes to 
  
  
 
                                   
        
 the future yes to freedom In a word I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is 
 love Love both profound and abiding  
 Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter to the most fundamental distinction of all between 
 East and West The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to 
 the spirit thwarting the human impulse to create to enjoy to worship The totalitarian world 
 finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront  
 Years ago before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches they erected a secular 
 structure the television tower at Alexander Platz Virtually ever since the authorities have 
 been working to correct what they view as the tower 's one major flaw treating the glass 
 sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind Yet even today when the sun 
 strikes that sphere that sphere that towers over all Berlin the light makes the sign of the 
 cross There in Berlin like the city itself symbols of love symbols of worship can not be 
 suppressed 
 As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag that embodiment of German unity I 
 noticed words crudely spray painted upon the wall   Berliner quote This 
 wall will fall Beliefs become reality 
 Yes across Europe this wall will fall for it can not withstand faith it can not withstand truth 
 The wall can not withstand freedom 
 And I would like before I close to say one word I have read and I have been questioned 
 since I 've been here about certain demonstrations against my coming And I would like to say 
 just one thing and to those who demonstrate so I wonder if they have ever asked 
 themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek no one 
 would ever be able to do what they 're doing again 
 Thank you and God bless you all Thank you

56,Robert F. Kennedy,Remarks on the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.,1968," 
 
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen  
 I 'm only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening because I have some 
 some very sad news for all of you Could you lower those signs please I have some very 
 sad news for all of you and I think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who 
 love peace all over the world and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed 
 tonight in Memphis Tennessee 
 Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings He 
 died in the cause of that effort In this difficult day in this difficult time for the United States 
 it 's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in 
 For those of you who are black considering the evidence evidently is that there were white 
 people who were responsible you can be filled with bitterness and with hatred and a desire 
 for revenge 
  
  
 
                                                                                                                         
 We can move in that direction as a country in greater polarization black people amongst 
 blacks and white amongst whites filled with hatred toward one another Or we can make an 
 effort as Martin Luther King did to understand and to comprehend and replace that 
 violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to 
 understand compassion and love 
 For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with be filled with hatred and 
 mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people I would only say that I can 
 also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling I had a member of my family killed but he 
 was   man 
 But we have to make an effort in the United States We have to make an effort to understand 
 to get beyond or go beyond these rather difficult times 
 My favorite poem my my favorite poet was Aeschylus And he once wrote 
 Even in our sleep pain which can not forget 
 falls   the heart 
 until in our own despair 
 against our will 
 comes wisdom 
 through the awful grace of God 
 What we need in the United States is not division what we need in the United States is not 
 hatred what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness but is love and 
 wisdom and compassion toward one another and a feeling of justice toward those who still 
 suffer within our country whether they be white or whether they be black 
 So I ask you tonight to return home to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King 
 yeah it 's true but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country which all of us 
 love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke 
 We can do well in this country We will have difficult times We 've had difficult times in the 
 past but we and we will have difficult times in the future It is not the end of violence it is 
 not the end of lawlessness and it 's not the end of disorder 
  
  
 
                                                                                                                         
 But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country 
 want to live together want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human 
 beings that abide in our land 
 And let 's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the 
 savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world Let us dedicate ourselves to that 
 and say a prayer for our country and for our people

57,Ronald Reagan,Remarks to the National Association of Evangelicals,1983," 
 
 
 Moderator Ladies and Gentlemen The President of the United States Ronald Reagan 
 President Reagan Thank you Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you very 
 much Thank you very much 
 And Reverend Clergy all Senator Hawkins distinguished members of the Florida 
 congressional delegation and all of you I ca n't tell you how you have warmed my heart with 
 your welcome I 'm delighted to be here today 
 Those of you in the National Association of Evangelicals are known for your spiritual and 
 humanitarian work And I would be especially remiss if I did n't discharge right now one 
 personal debt of gratitude Thank you for your prayers Nancy and I have felt their presence 
 many times in many ways And believe me for us they 've made all the difference 
 The other day in the East Room of the White House at a meeting there someone asked me 
 whether I was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the President And I had 
 to say Yes I am I 've felt it I believe in intercessionary sic prayer But I could n't help but 
 say to that questioner after he 'd asked the question that or at least say to them that if 
  
  
 
                                       
 sometimes when he was praying he got a busy signal it was just me in there ahead of him I 
 think I understand how Abraham Lincoln felt when he said I have been driven many times to 
 my   conviction that I had nowhere else to go From the joy and 
 the good feeling of this conference I go to a political reception Now I do n't know why but 
 that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story which I 'll share with you 
 An evangelical minister and a politician arrived at Heaven 's gate one day together And St. 
 Peter after doing all the necessary formalities took them in hand to show them where their 
 quarters would be And he took them to a small single room with a bed a chair and a table 
 and said this was for the clergyman And the politician was a little worried about what might 
 be in store for him And he could n't believe it then when St. Peter stopped in front of a 
 beautiful mansion with lovely grounds many servants and told him that these would be his 
 quarters 
 And he could n't help but ask he said But wait how there 's something wrong how do I 
 get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room And St. Peter said 
 You have to understand how things are up here We 've got thousands and thousands of 
 clergy You 're the first politician who ever made it 
 But I do n't want to contribute to a stereotype So I tell you there are a great many God- 
 fearing dedicated noble men and women in public life present company included And yes 
 we need your help to keep us ever mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into 
 the public arena in the first place The basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to 
 freedom and personal liberty that itself is grounded in the much deeper realization that 
 freedom prospers only where the blessings of God are avidly sought and humbly accepted 
 The American experiment in democracy rests on this insight Its discovery was the great 
 triumph of our Founding Fathers   when he said If we will not be 
  must be  the inalienable rights of men 
 Jefferson said The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time And it was 
 George Washington who said that of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political 
 prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports 
 And finally that shrewdest of all observers of American democracy Alexis de Tocqueville put 
 it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America 's greatness and genius 
 and he said Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with 
 righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America America is good And 
 if America ever ceases to be good America will cease to be great 
  
  
 
                                       
 Well I 'm pleased to be here today with you who are keeping America  
 good Only through your work and prayers and those of millions of others can we hope to 
 survive this perilous century and keep alive this experiment in liberty this last best hope of 
 man 
 I want you to know that this administration is   philosophy that sees the 
 greatness of America in you her people and in your families churches neighborhoods 
 communities the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and 
 respect for the rule of law under God 
 Now I do n't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to or at least out of step with a 
 a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern day secularism discarding the 
 tried and time tested values upon which our very civilization is based No matter how well 
 intentioned their value system is radically different from that of most Americans And while 
 they proclaim that they 're freeing us from superstitions of the past they 've taken upon 
 themselves the job of superintending   and regulation Sometimes their 
 voices are louder than ours but they are not yet a majority 
 An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington 
 And since I 'm involved I 've been waiting to hear from the parents of young America How far 
 are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents 
 Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can An organization of citizens sincerely 
 motivated deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving 
 girls well below the age of consent some time ago established a nationwide network of clinics 
 to offer help to these girls and hopefully alleviate this situation Now again let me say I do 
 not fault their intent However in their well intentioned effort these clinics decided to provide 
 advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their 
 parents 
 For some years now the federal government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics 
 In providing for this the Congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize 
 parental participation Nevertheless the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting 
 parental consent or giving notification after they 've done so Girls termed sexually active 
 and that has replaced the word promiscuous are given this help in order to prevent 
 illegitimate birth or abortion 
  
  
 
                                       
 Well we have ordered clinics receiving federal funds to notify the parents such help has been 
 given One of the nation 's leading newspapers has created the term squeal rule in 
 editorializing against us for doing this and we 're being criticized for violating the privacy of 
 young people A judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule 
 I 've watched TV panel shows discuss this issue seen columnists pontificating on our error but 
 no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex 
 Is all of Judeo Christian tradition wrong Are we to believe that something so sacred can be 
 looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological 
 harm And is n't it the parents right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from 
 making mistakes that may affect their entire lives 
 Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their 
  're going to fight in the courts The right of parents and the rights of 
 family take precedence over those of Washington based bureaucrats and social engineers 
 But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to 
 water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy 
 Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God is acknowledged 
 When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment they sought to protect churches 
 from government interference They never intended to construct a wall of hostility between 
 government and the concept of religious belief itself 
 The evidence of this permeates our history and our government The Declaration of 
 Independence mentions the Supreme Being no less than four times In God We Trust is 
 engraved on our coinage The Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious 
 invocation And the members of Congress open their sessions with a prayer I just happen to 
 believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme 
 Court justices and congressmen 
 Last year I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools 
 Already this session there 's growing bipartisan support for the amendment and I am calling 
 on the Congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray 
 Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case where a judge actually 
 ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and 
 nonreligious student groups even when the group meetings were being held during the 
  
  
 
                                       
 students own time The First Amendment never intended to require government to 
 discriminate against religious speech 
 Senators Denton and Hatfield have proposed legislation in the Congress on the whole question 
 of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech Such legislation could 
 go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students And I hope the 
 Congress considers these bills quickly And with your help I think it 's possible we could also 
 get the constitutional amendment through the Congress this year  
 More than a decade ago a Supreme Court decision literally wiped off the books of fifty states 
 statutes protecting the rights of unborn children Abortion on demand now takes the lives of 
 up to one and a half million unborn children a year Human life legislation ending this tragedy 
 will someday pass the Congress and you and I must never rest until it does Unless and until 
 it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity then its right to life liberty and 
 the pursuit of happiness must be protected 
 You may remember that when abortion on demand began many and indeed I 'm sure many 
 of you warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life that the 
 philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify 
 other attacks on the sacredness of human life infanticide or mercy killing Tragically 
 enough those warnings proved all too true Only last year a court permitted the death by 
 starvation of a handicapped infant 
 I have directed the Health and Human Services Department to make clear to every health 
 care facility in the United States that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects all handicapped 
 persons against discrimination based on handicaps including infants And we have taken the 
 further step of requiring that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health 
 care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that 
 discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by 
 federal law It also lists a twenty four hour toll free number so that nurses and others may 
 report violations in time to save the infant 's life 
 In addition recent legislation    Hyde 
 of Illinois not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions it also addresses this 
 whole problem of infanticide I urge the Congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation 
 that will protect the right of life to all children including the disabled or handicapped 
  
  
 
                                       
 Now I 'm sure that you must get discouraged at times but there you 've done better than you 
 know perhaps There 's a great spiritual awakening in America a renewal of the traditional 
 values that have been the bedrock of America 's goodness and greatness 
 One recent -based research council concluded that Americans were far 
 more religious than the people of other nations 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a 
 belief in God and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning in their 
 lives And another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of 
 adultery teenage sex pornography abortion and hard drugs And this same study showed a 
 deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief 
 I think the items that we 've discussed here today must be a key part of the nation 's political 
 agenda For the first time the Congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the 
 prayer and abortion issues and that 's enormous progress right there I repeat America is in 
 the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal And with your biblical keynote I say 
 today Yes let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a never failing stream 
 Now obviously much of this new political and social consensus I 've talked about is based on 
 a positive view of American history one that takes pride in our country 's accomplishments 
 and record But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man 
 We know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the 
 phenomenology of evil or as theologians would put it the doctrine of sin 
 There is sin and evil in the world and we 're   the Lord Jesus to 
 oppose it with all our might Our nation too has a legacy of evil with which it must deal The 
 glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past For 
 example the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights once a source of disunity and 
 civil war is now a point of pride for all Americans We must never go back There is no room 
 for racism anti Semitism or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country 
 I know that you 've been horrified as have  of some hate groups 
 preaching bigotry and prejudice Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful 
 standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst The 
 commandment given us is clear and simple Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 
 
  
  
 
                                       
 But whatever sad episodes exist in our past any objective observer must hold a positive view 
 of American history a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into 
 reality Especially in this century America has kept alight the torch of freedom but not just 
 for ourselves but for millions of others around the world 
 And this brings me to my final point today During my first press conference as president in 
 answer to a direct question I pointed out that as good Marxist Leninists the Soviet leaders 
 have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will 
 further their cause which is world revolution I think I should point out I was only quoting 
 Lenin their guiding spirit who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds 
 from supernatural ideas that 's their name for religion or ideas that are outside class 
 conceptions Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war And everything is 
 moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order and for uniting 
 the proletariat 
 Well I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of Soviet 
 doctrine illustrates a historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are We saw 
 this phenomenon in the 1930s We see it too often today 
 This does n't mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with 
 them I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent to remind them 
 that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for 
 territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the 
 elimination of an entire class of land based intermediate range nuclear missiles 
 At the same time however they must be made to understand we will never compromise our 
 principles and standards We will never give away our freedom We will never abandon our 
 belief in God And we will never stop searching for a genuine peace But we can assure none 
 of these things America stands for through the so called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by 
 some 
 The truth is that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud for that is merely the illusion 
 of peace The reality is that we must find peace through strength 
 I would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the Soviets global desires A freeze at 
 current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously in 
 Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have 
 proposed Instead they would achieve their objectives through the freeze 
  
  
 
                                       
 A freeze would reward the Soviet Union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup It 
 would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of United States and allied 
 defenses and would leave our aging forces increasingly vulnerable And an honest freeze 
 would require extensive prior negotiations on the systems and numbers to be limited and on 
 the measures to ensure effective verification and compliance And the kind of a freeze that 
 has been suggested would be virtually impossible to verify Such a major effort would divert 
 us completely from our current negotiations on achieving substantial reductions 
 A number of years ago I heard a young father a very prominent young man in the 
 entertainment world addressing a tremendous gathering in California It was during the time 
 of the cold war and communism and our own way of life were very much on people 's minds 
 And he was speaking to that subject And suddenly though I heard him saying I love my 
 little girls more than anything And I said to myself Oh no do n't You ca n't do n't say 
 that But I had underestimated him He went on I would rather see my little girls die now 
 still believing in God than have them grow up under communism and one day die no longer 
 believing in God 
 There were thousands of young people in that audience They came to their feet with shouts 
 of joy They had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said with regard to 
 the physical and the soul and what was truly important 
 Yes let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness Pray 
 they will discover the joy of knowing God But until they do let us be aware that while they 
 preach the supremacy of the State declare its omnipotence over individual man and predict 
 its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth they are the focus of evil in the modern 
 world 
 It was C.S. Lewis who in his unforgettable Screw Tape Letters wrote The greatest evil is 
 not done now in those sordid dens of crime that Dickens loved to paint It is not even done in 
 concentration camps and labor camps In those we see its final result But it is conceived and 
 ordered moved seconded carried and minuted in clear carpeted warmed and well lighted 
  with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth shaven cheeks who do 
 not need to raise their voice 
 Well because these quiet men do not raise their voices because they sometimes speak in 
 soothing tones of brotherhood and peace because like other dictators before them they 're 
 always making their final territorial demand some would have us accept them at their word 
 and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses But if history teaches anything it 
  
  
 
                                       
 teaches that simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly It 
 means the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom 
 So I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of 
 military and moral inferiority You know I 've always believed that old Screw Tape reserved his 
 best efforts for those of you in the Church So in your discussions of the nuclear freeze 
 proposals I urge you to beware the temptation of pride --the temptation of blithely declaring 
 yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault to ignore the facts of history and 
 the aggressive impulses of an evil empire to simply call the arms race a giant 
 misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong 
 and good and evil 
 I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our 
 efforts this administration 's efforts to keep America strong and free while we negotiate real 
 and verifiable reductions in the world 's nuclear arsenals and one day with God 's help their 
 total elimination 
 While America 's military strength is important let me add here that I 've always maintained 
 that the struggle now going on for the world will never be   rockets by 
 armies or military might The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one at root it is a test of 
 moral will and faith 
 Whittaker Chambers the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of 
 the terrible traumas of our time the Hiss Chambers case wrote that the crisis of the Western 
 world exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God the degree to which it 
 collaborates in communism 's attempt to make man stand alone without God And then he 
 said for Marxism Leninism is actually the second oldest faith first proclaimed in the Garden 
 of Eden with the words of temptation Ye shall be as gods 
 The Western world can answer this challenge he wrote but only provided that its faith in 
 God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as communism 's faith in Man 
 I believe we shall rise to the challenge I believe that communism is another sad bizarre 
 chapter in human history whose last last pages even now are being written I believe this 
 because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material but 
 spiritual And because it knows no limitation it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those 
 who would enslave their fellow man For in the words of Isaiah 
  
  
 
                                       0 
 He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might He increased strength 
 But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with 
 wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary.1 
 Yes change your world One of our Founding Fathers Thomas Paine said We have it within 
 our power to begin the world over again We can do it doing together what no one church 
 could do by itself 
 God bless you and thank you very much

58,Ted Kennedy,1980 Democratic National Concession Address,1980," 
 
 
 Thanks very much Barbara Mikulski for your very eloquent your eloquent introduction 
 Distinguished legislator great spokeswoman for economic democracy and social justice in this 
 country I thank you for your eloquent introduction 
 Well things worked out a little different from the way I thought but let me tell you I still love 
 New York 
 My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans I have come here tonight not to argue as a 
 candidate but to affirm a cause 
 I 'm asking you I am asking you to renew the commitment of the Democratic Party to 
 economic justice 
 I am asking you to renew our commitment to a fair and lasting prosperity that can put 
 America back to work 
  
  
 
              
 This is the cause that brought me into the campaign and that sustained me for nine months 
 across a 100,000 miles in 40 different states We had our losses but the pain of our defeats is 
 far far less than the pain of the people that I have met 
 We have learned that it is important to take issues seriously but never to take ourselves too 
 seriously 
 The serious issue before us tonight is the cause for which the Democratic Party has stood in 
 its finest hours the cause that keeps our Party young and makes it in the second century of 
 its age the largest political Party in this republic and the longest lasting political Party on this 
 planet 
 Our cause has been since the days of Thomas Jefferson the cause of the common man and 
 the common woman 
 Our commitment has been since the days of Andrew Jackson to all those he called the 
 humble members of society the farmers mechanics and laborers On this foundation we 
 have defined our values refined our policies and refreshed our faith 
 Now I take the unusual step of carrying the cause and the commitment of my campaign 
 personally to our national convention I speak out of a deep sense of urgency about the 
 anguish and anxiety I have seen across America 
 I speak out of a deep belief in the ideals of the Democratic Party and in the potential of that 
 Party and of a President to make a difference And I speak out of a deep trust in our capacity 
 to proceed with boldness and a common vision that will feel and heal the suffering of our time 
 and the divisions of our Party 
 The economic plank of this platform on its face concerns only material things but it is also a 
 moral issue that I raise tonight It has taken many forms over many years In this campaign 
 and in this country that we seek to lead the challenge in 1980 is to give our voice and our 
 vote for these fundamental democratic principles 
 Let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment high interest rates and human 
 misery as false weapons against inflation 
 Let us pledge that employment will be the first priority of our economic policy 
  
  
 
              
 Let us pledge that there will be security for all those who are now at work and let us pledge 
 that there will be jobs for all who are out of work and we will not compromise on the issues 
 of jobs 
 These are not simplistic pledges Simply put they are the heart of our tradition and they 
 have been the soul of our Party across the generations It is the glory and the greatness of 
 our tradition to speak for those who have no voice to remember those who are forgotten to 
 respond to the frustrations and fulfill the aspirations of all Americans seeking a better life in a 
 better land 
 We dare not forsake that tradition  
 We can not let the great purposes of the Democratic Party become the bygone passages of 
 history 
 We must not permit the Republicans to seize and run on the slogans of prosperity We heard 
 the orators at their convention all trying to talk like Democrats They proved that even 
 Republican nominees can quote Franklin Roosevelt to their own purpose 
 The Grand Old Party thinks it has found a great new trick but 40 years ago an earlier 
 generation of Republicans attempted the same trick And Franklin Roosevelt himself replied 
 Most Republican leaders have bitterly fought and blocked the forward surge of average men 
 and women in their pursuit of happiness Let us not be deluded that overnight those leaders 
 have suddenly become the friends of average men and women 
 You know he continued very few of us are that gullible And four years later when the 
 Republicans tried that trick again Franklin Roosevelt asked Can the Old Guard pass itself off 
 as the New Deal I think not We have all seen many marvelous stunts in the circus but no 
 performing elephant could turn a handspring without falling flat on its back 
 The 1980 Republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress but 
 it   record and not their recent words that you shall know them 
 The same Republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a 
 man who once said and I quote Unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for 
 freeloaders And that nominee is no friend of labor 
  
  
 
              
 The same Republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated 
 a man who said and I quote I have included in my morning and evening prayers every day 
 the prayer that the Federal Government not bail out New York And that nominee is no friend 
 of this city and our great urban centers across this nation 
 The same Republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man 
 who said just four years ago that Participation in social security should be made voluntary 
 And that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation 
 The same Republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a 
 man who last year made the preposterous statement and I quote Eighty percent of our air 
 pollution comes from plants and trees And that nominee is no friend of the environment 
 And the same Republicans who are invoking Franklin Roosevelt have nominated a man who 
 said in 1976 and these are his exact words Fascism was really the basis of the New Deal 
 And that nominee whose name is Ronald Reagan has no right to quote Franklin Delano 
 Roosevelt 
 The great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past Progress is our 
 heritage not theirs What is right for us as Democrats is also the right way for Democrats to 
 win 
 The commitment I seek is not to outworn views but to old values that will never wear out 
 Programs may sometimes become obsolete but the ideal of fairness always endures 
 Circumstances may change but the work of compassion must continue It is surely correct 
 that we can not solve   at them but it is also correct that we dare 
 not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference The 
 poor may be out of political fashion but they are not without human needs The middle class 
 may be angry but they have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together 
 The demand of our people in 1980 is not for smaller government or bigger government but for 
 better government Some say that government is always bad and that spending for basic 
 social programs is the root of our economic evils But we reply The present inflation and 
 recession cost our economy 200 billion dollars a year We reply Inflation and unemployment 
 are the biggest spenders of all 
 
  
  
 
              
 The task of leadership in 1980 is not to parade scapegoats or to seek refuge in reaction but 
 to match our power to the possibilities of progress While others talked of free enterprise it 
 was the Democratic Party that acted and we ended excessive regulation in the airline and 
 trucking industry and we restored competition to the marketplace And I take some 
 satisfaction that this deregulation legislation that I sponsored and passed in the Congress of 
 the United States 
 As Democrats we recognize that each generation of Americans has a rendezvous with a 
 different reality The answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation 
 But there is a guiding star in the American firmament It is as old as the revolutionary belief 
 that all people are created equal and as clear as the contemporary condition of Liberty City 
 and the South Bronx Again and again Democratic leaders have followed that star and they 
 have given new meaning to the old values of liberty and justice for all 
 We are the Party We are the Party of the New Freedom the New Deal and the New 
 Frontier We have always been the Party of hope So this year let us offer new hope new 
 hope to an America uncertain about the present but unsurpassed in its potential for the 
 future 
 To all those who are idle in the cities and industries of America let us provide new hope for the 
 dignity of useful work Democrats have always believed that a basic civil right of all Americans 
 is that their right to earn their own way The Party of the people must always be the Party of 
 full employment 
 To all those who doubt the future of our economy let us provide new hope for the 
 reindustrialization of America And let our vision reach beyond the next election or the next 
 year to a new generation of prosperity If we could rebuild Germany and Japan after World 
 War II then surely we can reindustrialize our own nation and revive our inner cities in the 
 1980 's 
 To all those who work hard for a living wage let us provide new hope that their price of their 
 employment shall not be an unsafe workplace and a death at an earlier age 
 To all those who inhabit our land from California to the New York Island from the Redwood 
 Forest to the Gulf stream waters let us provide new hope that prosperity shall not be 
  air the rivers and the natural resources that are the greatest gift 
 of this continent We must insist that our children and our grandchildren shall inherit a land 
 which they can truly call America the beautiful 
  
  
 
              
 To all those who see the worth of their work and their savings  us offer 
 new hope for a stable economy We must meet the pressures of the  
 full power of government to master increasing prices In candor we must say that the Federal 
 budget can be balanced   bring us to a balanced prosperity of full 
 employment and price restraint 
 And to all those   tax structure let us provide new hope for real tax 
 reform Instead of shutting down classrooms let us shut off tax shelters Instead of cutting 
 out school lunches let us cut off tax subsidies for expensive business lunches that are nothing 
 more than food stamps for the rich 
 The tax cut of our Republican opponents takes the name of tax reform in vain It is a 
 wonderfully Republican idea that would redistribute income in the wrong direction It 's good 
 news for any of you with incomes over 200,000 dollars a year For the few of you it offers a 
 pot of gold worth 14,000 dollars But the Republican tax cut is bad news for the middle 
 income families For the many of you they plan a pittance of 200 dollars a year and that is 
 not what the Democratic Party means when we say tax reform 
 The vast majority of Americans can not afford this panacea from a Republican nominee who 
 has denounced the progressive income tax as the invention of Karl Marx I am afraid he has 
 confused Karl Marx with Theodore Roosevelt that obscure Republican president who sought 
 and fought for a tax system based on ability to pay Theodore Roosevelt was not Karl Marx 
 and the Republican tax scheme is not tax reform 
 Finally we can not have a fair prosperity in isolation from a fair society So I will continue to 
 stand for a national health insurance We must We must not surrender We must not 
 surrender to the relentless medical inflation that can bankrupt almost anyone and that may 
 soon break the budgets of government at every level Let us insist on real controls over what 
 doctors and hospitals can charge and let us resolve that the state of a family 's health shall 
 never depend on the size of a family 's wealth 
 The President the Vice President the members of Congress have a medical plan that meets 
 their needs in full and whenever senators and representatives catch a little cold the Capitol 
 physician will see them immediately treat them promptly fill a prescription on the spot We 
 do not get a bill even if we ask for it and when do you think was the last time a member of 
 Congress asked for a bill from the Federal Government And I say again as I have before if 
 health insurance is good enough for the President the Vice President the Congress of the 
 United States then it 's good enough for you and every family in America 
  
  
 
              
 There were some There were some who said we should be silent about our differences on 
 issues during this convention but the heritage of the Democratic Party has been a history of 
 democracy We fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and purposes We did 
 not flee this struggle We welcome the contrast with the empty and expedient spectacle last 
 month in Detroit where no nomination was contested no question was debated and no one 
 dared to raise any doubt or dissent 
 Democrats can be proud that we chose a different course and a different platform  
 We can be proud that our Party stands for investment in safe energy instead of a nuclear 
 future that may threaten the future itself We must not permit the neighborhoods of America 
 to be permanently   of another Three Mile Island 
 We can be proud that our Party stands for a fair housing law to unlock the doors of 
 discrimination once and for all The American house will be divided against itself so long as 
 there is prejudice against any American buying or renting a home 
 And we can be proud that our Party stands plainly and publicly and persistently for the 
 ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment 
 Women hold their rightful place at our convention and women must have their rightful place 
 in the Constitution of the United States On this issue we will not yield we will not equivocate 
 we will not rationalize explain or excuse We will stand for E.R.A. and for the recognition at 
 long last that our nation was made up of founding mothers as well as founding fathers 
 A fair prosperity and a just society are within our vision and our grasp and we do not have 
 every answer There are questions not yet asked waiting for us in the recesses of the future 
 But of this much we can be certain because it is the lesson of all of our history Together a 
 President and the people can make a difference I have found that faith still alive wherever I 
 have traveled across this land So let us reject the counsel of retreat and the call to reaction 
 Let us go forward in the knowledge that history only helps those who help themselves 
 There will be setbacks and sacrifices in the years ahead but I am convinced that we as a 
 people are ready to give something back to our country in return for all it has given to us 
 Let this Let this be our commitment Whatever sacrifices must be made will be shared and 
 shared fairly And let this be our confidence At the end of our journey and always before us 
 shines that ideal of liberty and justice for all 
  
  
 
              
 In closing let me say a few words to all those that I have met and to all those who have 
 supported me at this convention and across the country There were hard hours on our 
 journey and often we sailed against the wind But always we kept our rudder true and there 
 were so many of you who stayed the course and shared our hope You gave your help but 
 even more you gave your hearts 
 And because of you this has been a happy campaign You welcomed Joan me and our family 
 into your homes and neighborhoods your churches your campuses your union halls And 
 when I think back of all the miles and all the months and all the memories I think of you And 
 I recall the poet 's words and I say What golden friends I had 
 Among you my golden friends across this land I have listened and learned 
 I have listened to Kenny Dubois a glassblower in Charleston West Virginia who has ten 
 children to support but has lost his job after 35 years just three years short of qualifying for 
 his pension 
 I have listened to the Trachta family who farm in Iowa and who wonder whether they can 
 pass the good life and the good earth on to their children 
 I have listened to the grandmother in East Oakland who no longer has a phone to call her 
 grandchildren because she gave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment 
 I have listened to young workers out of work to students without the tuition for college and 
 to families without the chance to own a home  
 I have seen the closed factories and the stalled assembly lines of Anderson Indiana and 
 South Gate California and I have seen too many far too many idle men and women 
 desperate to work  
 I have seen too many far too many working families desperate to protect the value of their 
 wages from the ravages of inflation 
 Yet I have also sensed a yearning for a new hope among the people in every state where I 
 have been 
 And I have felt it in their handshakes I saw it in their faces and I shall never forget the 
 mothers who carried children to our rallies 
  
  
 
              
 I shall always remember the elderly who have lived in an America of high purpose and who 
 believe that it can all happen again 
 Tonight in their name I have come here to speak for them And for their sake I ask you to 
 stand with them On their behalf I ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of our 
 Party 
 I congratulate President Carter on his victory here 
 I am I am confident that the Democratic Party will reunite on the basis of Democratic 
 principles and that together we will march towards a Democratic victory in 1980 
 And someday long after this convention long after the signs come down and the crowds stop 
 cheering and the bands stop playing may it be said of our campaign that we kept the faith  
 May it be said of our Party in 1980 that we found our faith again 
 And may it be said of us both in dark passages and in bright days in the words of Tennyson 
 that my brothers quoted and loved and that have special meaning for me now 
 I am a part of all that I have met 
 To Tho much is taken much abides 
 That which we are we are 
 One equal temper of heroic hearts 
 Strong in will 
 To strive to seek to find and not to yield 
 For me a few hours ago this campaign came to an end 
 For all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the 
 hope still lives and the dream shall never die",0.0151302982121706,0.00441250577569,0.8412529826164246,0.0361558832228183,0.0800710842013359,0.0191456228494644,0.0038315521087497,0.149339511621065,0.483263389792516,58.48342307692309,0.2817182817182817,0.01251276813074566,0.10416666666666667,0.04262478968031408,25.102564102564102,1.0
59,Woodrow Wilson,The Fourteen Points,1918," 
 
 It will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace when they are begun shall be 
 absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of 
 any kind The day of conquest and aggrandizement is  also the day of secret 
 covenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and likely at some unlooked- 
 for moment to upset the peace of the world It is this happy fact now clear to the view of 
 every public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone which 
 makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with justice and the peace of 
 the world to avow nor or at any other time the objects it has in view  
 We entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick 
 and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world 
 secure once for all against their recurrence What we demand in this war therefore is nothing 
 peculiar to ourselves It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in and particularly that 
 it be made safe for every peace loving nation which like our own wishes to live its own life 
 determine its own institutions be assured of justice and fair   peoples of 
 the world as against force and selfish aggression All the peoples of the world are in effect 
 partners in this interest and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done 
 to others it will not be done to us The program of the world 's peace therefore is our 
 program and that program the only possible program as we see it is this  
  
  
 
                 
 I. Open covenants of peace openly arrived at after which there shall be no private 
 international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the 
 public view  
 II Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas outside territorial waters alike in peace and 
 in war except as the seas may be closed in whole or in   for the 
 enforcement of international covenants  
 III The removal so far as possible of all economic barriers and the establishment of an 
 equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating 
 themselves for its maintenance  
 IV Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the 
 lowest point consistent with domestic safety  
 V. A free open minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims based upon 
 a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the 
 interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of 
 the government whose title is to be determined  
 VI The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting 
 Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in 
 obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent 
 determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere 
 welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing and more 
 than a welcome assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire The 
 treatment accorded   nations in the months to come will be the acid test of 
 their good will of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests 
 and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy  
 VII Belgium the whole world will agree must be evacuated and restored without any 
 attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations No 
 other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the 
 laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations 
 with one another Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law 
 is forever impaired  
  
  
 
                 
 VIII All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored and the wrong 
 done to   1871 in the matter of Alsace Lorraine which has unsettled the 
 peace of the world for nearly fifty years should be righted in order that peace may once 
 more be made secure in the interest of all  
 IX A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines 
 of nationality  
 X. The peoples of Austria Hungary whose place among the nations we wish to see 
 safeguarded and assured should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous 
 development  
 XI Rumania Serbia and Montenegro should be evacuated occupied territories restored 
 Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea and the relations of the several Balkan 
 states to one another   along historically established lines of 
 allegiance and nationality and international guarantees of the political and economic 
 independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into  
 XII The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure 
 sovereignty but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured 
 an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous 
 development and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the 
 ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees  
 XIII An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories 
  populations which should be assured a free and secure access 
 to the sea and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be 
  
 XIV A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose 
 of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and 
 small states alike  
 In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right we feel ourselves to 
 be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the 
 Imperialists We can not be separated in interest or divided in purpose We stand together until 
 the end  
  
  
 
                 
 For such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they 
 are achieved but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace 
 such as can be secured   chief provocations to war which this program 
 does remove We have no jealousy of German greatness and there is nothing in this program 
 that impairs it We grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise 
 such as have made her record very bright an d very enviable We do not wish to injure her or 
 to block in any way her legitimate influence or power We do not wish to fight her either with 
 arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to associate herself with us and the 
 other peace loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing We 
 wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world the new world in 
 which we now live instead of a place of mastery",0.0375770516693592,0.016298359259963,0.0257502552121877,0.5831589698791504,0.3006644248962402,0.0307510085403919,0.0057998923584818,0.1956522644022644,0.5143523143523143,36.071799912306375,0.360655737704918,0.012903225806451613,0.07590759075907591,0.07148407148407149,31.704545454545453,1.0
60,John F. Kennedy,Presidential Inaugural Address,1961," 
 
 
 Vice President Johnson Mr. Speaker Mr. Chief Justice President Eisenhower Vice President 
 Nixon President Truman reverend clergy fellow citizens 
 
 We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end 
 as well as a beginning signifying renewal as well as change For I have sworn before you 
 and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three- 
 quarters ago 
 The world is very different now For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all 
 forms of human poverty and all forms of human life And yet the same revolutionary beliefs 
 for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of 
 man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God 
 We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
                                         
 Let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been 
 passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century  
 by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit 
 the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and 
 to which we are committed today at home and around the world 
 Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any 
 burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the 
 success of liberty 
 This much we pledge and more 
 
 To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share we pledge the loyalty of 
 faithful friends United there is little we can not do in a host of cooperative ventures Divided 
 there is little we can do for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split 
 asunder 
 To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free we pledge our word that one 
 form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be   more iron 
 tyranny We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view But we shall always 
 hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom and to remember that in the 
 past those who foolishly sought   back of the tiger ended up inside 
 To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of 
 mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is 
 required not because the Communists may be doing it not because we seek their votes 
 but because it is right If a free society can not help the many who are poor it can not save the 
 few who are rich 
 To our sister republics south of our border we offer a special pledge to convert our good 
 words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free 
 governments in casting off the chains of poverty But this peaceful revolution of hope can not 
 become the prey of hostile powers Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to 
 oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas And let every other power know 
 that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house 
 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
                                         
 To that world assembly of sovereign states the United Nations our last best hope in an age 
 where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace we renew our 
 pledge of support to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen 
 its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run 
 
 Finally to those nations who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but 
 a request that both sides begin anew the quest for peace before the dark powers of 
 destruction   all humanity in planned or accidental self destruction 
 
 We dare not tempt them with weakness For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt 
 can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed 
 But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present 
 course both sides   of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by 
 the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror 
 that stays the hand of mankind 's final war 
 So let us begin anew remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness and 
 sincerity is always subject to proof Let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to 
 negotiate 
 Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which 
 divide us 
 
 Let both sides for the first time formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection 
 and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute 
 control of all nations 
 
 Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors Together let us 
 explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and 
 encourage the arts and commerce 
 
 Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah to undo the 
 heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free ""¹ 
 
 And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion let both sides join 
 in creating a new endeavor not a new balance of power but a new world of law where 
 the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved 
  
  
 
                   
       
       
                                         
 All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days Nor will it be finished in the first one 
 thousand days nor in the life of this Administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this 
 planet But let us begin 
 
 In your hands my fellow citizens more than mine will rest the final success or failure of our 
 course Since this country was founded each generation of Americans has been summoned to 
 give testimony to its national loyalty The graves of young Americans who answered the call 
 to service surround the globe 
 
 Now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not 
 as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight 
 struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation,""² a struggle against 
 the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself 
 Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance North and South East and 
 West that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind Will you join in that historic effort 
 In the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of 
 defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger I do not shrink from this responsibility I 
 welcome it I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or 
 any other generation The energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will 
 light our country and all who serve it And the glow from that fire can truly light the world 
 
 And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do 
 for your country 
 
 My fellow citizens of the world ask not what America will do for you but what together we 
 can do for the freedom of man 
 Finally whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world ask of us here the same 
 high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you With a good conscience our only 
 sure reward with history the final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love 
 asking His blessing and His help but knowing that here on earth God 's work must truly be our 
 own

61,William Jennings Bryan,Against Imperialism,1900," 
 
 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Notification Committee   I shall at an early day and in a 
 more formal manner accept the nomination which you tender and shall at that time discuss 
 the various questions   platform   It may not be out of place 
 however to submit a few observations at this time upon the general character of the contest 
 before us and upon the question which is declared to be of paramount importance in this 
 campaign 
 When I say that the contest of 1900 is a contest of 1900 is a contest between Democracy on 
 the one hand and plutocracy on the other I do not mean to say that all our opponents have 
 deliberately chosen to give to organized wealth a predominating influence in the affairs of the 
 Government but I do assert that on the important issues of the day the Republican party is 
  which constantly tend to substitute the worship of mammon for 
 the protection of the rights of man 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 In 1859 Lincoln said that the Republican Party believed in the man and the dollar but that in 
 case of conflict it believed in the man before the dollar   This is the proper relation which 
 should exist between the two   Man the handiwork of God comes first money the handiwork 
 of man is of inferior importance   Man is the master money the servant but upon all 
 important questions today Republican legislation tends to make money the master and man 
 the servant 
 The maxim of Jefferson equal rights to all and special privileges to none and the doctrine of 
 Lincoln that this should be a government of the  and for the people 
 are being disregarded and the instrumentalities of government are being used to advance the 
 interests of those who are in a position to secure favors from the Government 
 The Democratic party is not making war upon the honest acquisition of wealth it has no 
 desire to discourage industry economy and thrift   On the contrary it gives to every citizen 
 the greatest possible stimulus to honest toil when it promises him protection in the enjoyment 
 of the proceeds of his labor   Property rights are most secure when human rights are most 
 respected   Democracy strives for civilization in which every member of society will share 
 according to his merits 
 No one has a right to expect from a society more than a fair compensation for the services No 
 one has a right to expect from a society more than a fair compensation for the services which 
 he renders to society If he secures more it is at the expense of some one else It is no 
 injustice to him to prevent his doing injustice to another To him who would either through 
 class legislation or in the absence of necessary legislation trespass upon the rights of another 
 the Democratic party says Thou shalt not 
 Against us are arrayed a comparatively small but politically and financially powerful number 
 who really but with them are associated a large number who 
 because of their attachment to their party name are giving their support to doctrines 
 antagonistic to the former teachings of their own party 
 Republicans who used to advocate bimetallism now try to convince themselves that the gold 
 standard is good Republicans who were formerly attached to the greenback are now seeking 
 an excuse for giving national banks control of the nation 's paper money Republicans who 
 used to boast that the Republican party was paying off the national debt are now looking for 
 reasons to support a perpetual and increasing debt Republicans who formerly abhorred a 
 trust now beguile themselves with the delusion that there are good trusts and bad trusts 
 while in their minds the line between the two is becoming more and more obscure 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 Republicans who in times past congratulated the country upon the small expense of our 
 standing army are now making light of the objections which are urged against a large 
 increase in the permanent military establishment Republicans who gloried in our 
 independence when the nation was less powerful now look with favor upon a foreign alliance 
 Republicans who three years ago condemned forcible annexation as immoral and even 
 criminal are now sure that it is both immoral and criminal to oppose forcible annexation That 
 partisanship has already blinded many to present dangers is certain how large a portion of 
 the Republican party can be drawn over to the new policies remains to be seen 
 For a time Republican leaders were inclined to deny to opponents the right to criticize the 
 Philippine policy of the administration but upon investigation they found that both Lincoln and 
 Clay asserted and exercised the right to criticize a President during the progress of the 
 Mexican war  
 Instead of meeting the issue boldly and submitting a clear and positive plan for dealing with 
 the Philippine question the Republican convention adopted a platform the larger part of which 
 was devoted to boasting and self congratulation  
 In attempting to press economic questions upon the country to the exclusion of those which 
 involve the very structure of our government the Republican leaders give new evidence of 
 their abandonment of the earlier ideals of their party and of their complete subserviency to 
 pecuniary considerations  
 But they shall not be permitted to evade the stupendous and far reaching issue which they 
 have deliberately brought into the arena of politics When the president supported by a 
 practically unanimous vote of the House and Senate entered upon a war with Spain for the 
 purpose of aiding the struggling patriots of Cuba the country without regard to party 
 applauded  
 Although the Democrats realized that the administration would necessarily gain a political 
 advantage from the conduct of a war which in the very nature of the case must soon end in a 
 complete victory they vied with the Republicans in the support which they gave to the 
 president When the war was over and the Republican leaders began to suggest the propriety 
 of a colonial policy opposition at once manifested itself  
 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 When the President finally laid before the Senate a treaty which recognized the independence 
 of Cuba but provided for the cession of the Philippine Islands to the United States the 
 menace of imperialism became so apparent that many preferred to reject the treaty and risk 
 the ills that might follow rather than take the chance of correcting the errors of the treaty by 
 the independent action of this country  
 I was among the number of those who believed it better to ratify the treaty and end the war 
 release the volunteers remove the excuse for war expenditures and then give the Filipinos 
 the independence which might be forced from   treaty  
 In view of the criticism which my action aroused in some quarters I take this occasion to 
 restate the reasons given at that time I thought it safer to trust the American people to give 
 independence to the Filipinos than to trust the accomplishment of that purpose to diplomacy 
 with an unfriendly nation  
 Lincoln embodied an argument in the question when he asked Can aliens make treaties 
 easier than friends can make laws I believe that we are now in a better position to wage a 
 successful contest against imperialism than we would have been had the treaty been rejected 
 With the treaty ratified a clean cut issue is presented between a   a 
  imperialists must bear the responsibility for all that happens until 
 the question is settled  
 If the treaty had been rejected the opponents of imperialism would have been held 
 responsible for any international complications which might have arisen before the ratification 
 of another treaty But whatever difference of opinion may have existed as to the best method 
 of opposing a colonial policy there never was any difference as to the great importance of the 
 question and there is no difference now as to the course to be pursued  
 The title of Spain being extinguished we were at liberty to deal with the Filipinos according to 
 American principles The Bacon resolution introduced a month before hostilities broke out at 
 Manila promised independence to the Filipinos on the same terms that it was promised to the 
 Cubans I supported this resolution and believe that its adoption prior to the breaking out of 
 hostilities would have prevented bloodshed and that its adoption at any subsequent time 
 would have ended hostilities  
 If the treaty had been rejected considerable time would have necessarily elapsed before a new 
 treaty could have been agreed upon and ratified and during that time the question would have 
 been agitating the public mind 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 If the Bacon resolution had been   and carried 
 either at the time of the ratification of the treaty or at any time afterwards it would have 
 taken the question of imperialism out of politics and left the American people free to deal with 
 their domestic problems But the resolution was   of the Republican Vice- 
 President and from that time to this a republican congress has refused to take any action 
 whatever in the matter  
 When hostilities broke out at Manila republican speakers and Republican editors at once 
 sought to lay the blame upon those who had delayed the ratification of the treaty and during 
 the progress of the war the same republicans have accused the opponents of imperialism of 
 giving encouragement to the Filipinos This is a cowardly evasion of responsibility  
 If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate 
 European empires in the government of colonies the Republican party ought to state its 
 position and defend it but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy 
 and to resist to the extent of their ability  
 The Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living Our whole history 
 has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos but to all who are denied a voice in their 
 own government If the republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language 
 calculated to make the Filipinos hate foreign domination let them condemn the speech of 
 Patrick Henry When he uttered that passionate appeal Give me liberty or give me death 
 he expressed a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men  
 Let them censure Jefferson of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive 
 to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage Let them censure Washington who 
 declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery Or if the statute of 
 limitations has run again the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington let them censure 
 Lincoln whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the 
 present advocates of force and conquest are forgotten  
 Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled It goes on and on and no 
 one can set a limit to its ever widening influence But if it were possible to obliterate every 
 word written or spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of 
 Independence a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred for it was 
 God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty He never made a race of 
 people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master  
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider not only the 
 effect of imperialism on the Filipinos but they must also calculate its effects upon our own 
 nation   We can not repudiate the principle of self government in the Philippines without 
 weakening that principle here  
 Lincoln said that the safety of this Nation was not in its fleets its armies or its forts but in 
 the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands everywhere and he 
 warned his countrymen that they could not destroy this spirit without planting the seeds of 
 despotism at their own doors  
 Even now we are beginning to see the paralyzing influence if imperialism 
 Heretofore this Nation has been prompt to express its sympathy with those who were fighting 
 for civil liberty   While our sphere of activity has been limited to the Western Hemisphere our 
 sympathies have not been    We have felt it due to ourselves and to the 
 world as well as to those who were struggling for the right to govern themselves to proclaim 
 the interest which our people have from the date of their own independence felt in every 
 contest between human rights and arbitrary power  
 Three quarters of a century ago when our nation was small the struggles of Greece aroused 
 our people and Webster and Clay gave eloquent expression to the universal desire for Grecian 
 independence In 1896 all parties manifested a lively interest in the success of the Cubans 
 but now when a war is in progress in South Africa which must result in the extension of the 
 monarchical idea or in the triumph of a republic the advocates of imperialism in this country 
 dare not say a word in behalf of the Boers  
 Sympathy for the Boers does not arise from any unfriendliness towards England the American 
 people are not unfriendly toward the people of any nation This sympathy is due to the fact 
 that as stated in our platform we believe in the principles of self government and reject as 
 did our forefathers the claims of monarchy If this nation surrenders its belief in the universal 
 application of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence it will lose the 
 prestige and influence which it has enjoyed among the nations as an exponent of popular 
 government  
 Our opponents conscious of the weakness of their cause seek to confuse imperialism with 
 expansion and have even dared to claim Jefferson as a supporter of their policy Jefferson 
 spoke so freely and used language with such precision that no one can be ignorant of his 
 views On one occasion he declared If there be one principle more deeply rooted than any 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 other in the mind of every American it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest 
 And again he said Conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government 
 The forcible annexation of territory to be   differs as much from 
 the acquisition of territory to be built up into States as a monarchy differs from a democracy 
 The Democratic party does not oppose expansion when expansion enlarges the area of the 
 Republic and incorporates land which can be or adds to our 
 population people who are willing to become citizens and are capable of discharging their 
 duties as such 
 The acquisition of the Louisiana territory Florida Texas and other tracts which have been 
 secured from time to time enlarged the republic and the Constitution followed the flag into the 
 new territory It is now proposed to seize upon distant territory already more densely 
 populated than our own country and to force upon the people a government for which there is 
 no warrant in our Constitution or our laws  
 Even the argument that this earth belongs to those who desire to cultivate it and who have 
 the physical power to acquire it can not be invoked to justify the appropriation of the Philippine 
  States If the islands were uninhabited American citizens would not be 
 willing to go there and till the soil The white race will not live so near the equator Other 
 nations have tried to colonize in the same latitude The Netherlands have controlled Java for 
 three hundred years and yet today there are less than sixty thousand people of European 
 birth scattered among the twenty five million natives  
 After a century and a half of English domination in India less than one twentieth of one per 
 cent of the people of India are of English birth and it requires an army of seventy thousand 
 British soldiers to take care of the tax collectors Spain had asserted title to the Philippine 
 Islands for three centuries and yet when our fleet entered Manila bay there were less than ten 
 thousand Spaniards residing in the Philippines  
 A colonial policy means that we shall send to the Philippine Islands a few traders a few 
 taskmasters and a few office holders and an army large enough to support the authority of a 
 small fraction of the people while they rule the natives  
 If we have an imperial policy we must have a great standing army as its natural and 
 necessary complement   The sprit which will justify the forcible annexation of the Philippine 
 Islands will justify the seizure of other islands and the domination of other people and with 
 wars of conquest we can expect a certain if not rapid growth of our military establishment  
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 That a large permanent increase in our regular army is   is not 
 a matter of conjecture but a matter of fact In his message of December 5,1898 the 
 president asked for authority to increase the standing army to 100,000 In 1896 the army 
 contained about 25,000 Within two years the president asked for four times that many and a 
 Republican house of representatives complied with the request after the Spanish treaty had 
 been signed and when no country was at war with the United States  
 If such an army is demanded when an imperial policy is contemplated but not openly 
 avowed what may be expected if the people encourage the Republican  
 policy at the polls  
 A large standing army is not only a pecuniary burden to the people and if accompanied by 
 compulsory service a constant source of irritation but it is ever a menace to a Republican 
 form of government  
 The army is the personification of force and militarism will inevitably change the ideals of the 
 people and turn the thoughts of our young men from the arts of peace to the science of war 
 The Government which relies for its defense upon its citizens is more likely to be just than one 
 which has at call a large body of professional soldiers  
 A small standing army and a well equipped and well disciplined state militia are sufficient at 
 ordinary times and in an emergency the nation should in the future as in the past place its 
 dependence upon the volunteers who come from all occupations at their country 's call and 
 return to productive labor when their services are no longer required men who fight when 
 the country needs fighters and work when the country needs workers The Republican 
 platform assumes that the Philippine Islands will be retained under American sovereignty and 
 we have a right to demand of the republican leaders a discussion of the future status of the 
 Filipino Is he to be a citizen or a subject Are we to bring into the body politic eight or ten 
 million Asiatics so different from us in race and history that amalgamation is impossible Are 
 they to share with us in making the laws and shaping the destiny of this nation No republican 
 of prominence has been bold enough to advocate such a proposition  
 The McEnery resolution   immediately after the ratification of the treaty 
 expressly negatives this idea The Democratic platform describes the situation when it says 
 that the Filipinos can not be citizens without endangering our civilization Who will dispute it 
 And what is the alternative 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       
 If the Filipino is not to be a citizen shall we make him a subject On that question the 
 Democratic platform speaks with equal emphasis It declares that the Filipino can not be a 
 subject without endangering our form of government A republic can have no subjects A 
 subject is possible only in a government resting upon force he is unknown in a government 
 derived without consent and taxation without representation 
 The Republican platform says that the largest measure of self government consistent with 
 their welfare and our duties shall be secured to them the  is a strange 
 doctrine for a government which owes its very existence to the men who offered their lives as 
 a protest against government without consent and taxation without representation In what 
 respect does the position of the Republican party differ from the position  
 Government in 1776 Did not the English Government promise a good government to the 
 colonists What king ever promised a bad government to his people Did not the English 
 Government promise that the colonists should have the largest measure of self government 
 consistent with their welfare and English duties Did not the Spanish Government promise to 
 give to the Cubans the largest measure of self government consistent with their welfare and 
 Spanish duties The whole difference between a monarchy and a republic may be summed up 
 in one sentence In a monarchy the king gives to the people what he believes to be a good 
 government in a republic the people secure for themselves what they believe to be a good 
 government  
 The Republican party has accepted the European idea and planted itself upon the ground 
   who distrusts the capacity of the people for self- 
 government or denies them a voice in their own affairs  
 The Republican platform promises that some measure of self government is to be given the 
  even this pledge is not fulfilled Nearly sixteen months elapsed after the 
 ratification of the treaty before the adjournment of congress last June and yet no law was 
 passed dealing with the Philippine situation The will of the president has been the only law in 
 the Philippine islands wherever the American authority extends Why does the Republican 
 party hesitate to legislate upon the Philippine question Because a law would disclose the 
 radical departure from history and precedent   control the 
 Republican party The storm of protest which greeted the Puerto Rican bill was an indication of 
 what may be expected when the American people are brought face to face with legislation 
 upon this subject

 If the Puerto Ricans who welcomed annexation are to be denied the guarantees of our 
 Constitution what is to be the lot of the Filipinos who resisted our authority If secret 
 influences could compel a disregard of our plain duty toward friendly people living near our 
 shores what treatment will those same influences provide for unfriendly people 7,000 miles 
 away If in this country where the people have a right to vote republican leaders dare not 
 take the side of the people against the great monopolies which have grown up within the last 
 few years how can they be trusted to protect the Filipinos from the corporations which are 
 waiting to exploit the islands  
 Is the sunlight of full citizenship to be   of the United States and the 
 twilight of semi citizenship   of Puerto Rico while the thick darkness of 
 perpetual vassalage covers the Philippines The Puerto Rico tariff law asserts the doctrine that 
 the operation of the constitution is confined to the forty five states  
 The Democratic party disputes this doctrine and denounces it as repugnant to both the letter 
 and spirit of our organic law There is no place in our system of government for the deposit of 
 arbitrary and irresponsible power That the leaders of a great party should claim for any 
 president or congress the right to treat millions of people as mere possessions and deal with 
 them   or the bill of rights shows how far we have already 
 departed from the ancient landmarks and indicates what may be expected if this nation 
 deliberately enters upon a career of empire  
 The territorial form of government is temporary and preparatory and the chief security a 
 citizen of a territory has is found in the fact that he enjoys the same constitutional guarantees 
 and is subject to the same general laws as the citizen of a state Take away this security and 
 his rights will be violated and his interests sacrificed at the demand of those who have political 
 influence This is the evil of the colonial system no   
 What is our title to the Philippine Islands Do we hold   by conquest Did we 
 buy them or did we take them Did we purchase the people If not how did we secure title to 
 them Were they thrown in with the land Will the Republicans say that inanimate earth has 
 value but that when that earth is   hand and stamped with the likeness of 
 the Creator it becomes a fixture and passes with the soil If governments derive their just 
 powers from the consent of the governed it is impossible to secure title to people either by 
 force  could extinguish Spain 's  if we hold title we must 
 hold   consistent with our ideas of government When we made allies of the 
 Filipinos and armed them to fight against Spain we disputed Spain 's title If we buy Spain 's 
 title we are not innocent purchasers

 There can be no doubt that we accepted and utilized the services of the Filipinos and that 
 when we did so we had full knowledge that they were fighting for their own independence 
 and I submit that history furnishes no example of turpitude baser than ours if we now 
 substitute our yoke for the Spanish yoke 
 Let us consider briefly the reasons which have been given in support of an imperialistic policy 
 Some say that it is our duty to hold the Philippine Islands But duty is not an argument it is a 
 conclusion To ascertain what our duty is in any emergency we must apply well settled and 
 generally accepted principles It is our duty to avoid stealing no matter whether the thing to 
 be stolen is of great or little value It is our duty to avoid killing a human being no matter 
 where the human being lives or to what race or class he belongs  
 Every one recognizes the obligation imposed upon individuals to observe both the human and 
 the moral law but as some deny the application of those laws to nations it may not be out of 
 place to quote the opinions of others Jefferson than whom there is no higher political 
 authority said I know of but one code of morality for men whether acting singly or 
 collectively  
 Franklin whose learning wisdom and virtue are a part of the priceless legacy bequeathed to 
 use from the revolutionary days expressed the same idea in even stronger language when he 
 said  
 Justice is strictly due between neighbor nations as between neighbor citizens A 
 highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a gang as when single and the 
 nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang  
 Many may dare to do in crowds what they would not dare to do as individuals but the moral 
 character of an act is not   of those who join it Force can defend a 
 right but force has never yet created a right If it was true as declared in the resolutions of 
 intervention that the Cubans are and of right ought to be free and independent language 
 taken from the Declaration of Independence it is equally true that the Filipinos are and of 
 right ought to be free and independent  
 The right of the Cubans to freedom was not based upon their proximity to the United States 
 nor upon the language which they spoke nor yet upon the race or races to which they 
 belonged   unanimous vote declared that the principles enunciated at 
 Philadelphia in 1776 were still alive and applicable to the Cubans Who will draw a line 
 between the natural rights of the Cubans and the Filipinos Who will say that the former has a

 right to liberty and that the latter has no rights which we are bound to respect And if the 
 Filipinos are and of right ought to be free and independent what right have we to force our 
 government upon them without their consent Before our duty can be ascertained their rights 
 must be determined and when their rights are once determined it is as much our duty to 
 respect those rights as it was the duty of Spain to respect the rights of the people of Cuba or 
 the duty of England to respect the rights of the American colonists Rights never conflict 
 duties never clash Can it be our duty to usurp political rights which belong to others Can it 
 be our duty to kill those who following the example of our forefathers love liberty well 
 enough to fight for it  
 A poet has described the terror which overcame a soldier who in the midst of the battle 
 discovered that he had slain his brother It is written All ye are brethren Let us hope for the 
 coming day when human life which when once destroyed can not be restored will be so 
 sacred that it will never be taken except when necessary to punish a crime already 
 committed or to prevent a crime about to be committed  
 It is said that we have assumed before the world obligations which make it necessary for us to 
 permanently maintain a government in the Philippine Islands I reply first that the highest 
 obligation of this nation is to be true to itself No obligation to any particular nations or to all 
 the nations combined can require the abandonment of our theory of government and the 
 substitution of doctrines against which our whole national life has been a protest And 
 second that our obligation to the Filipinos who inhabit the islands is greater than any 
 obligation which we can owe to foreigners who have a temporary residence in the Philippines 
 or desire to trade there  
 It is   the Filipinos are incapable of self government and that therefore 
 we owe it to the world to take control of them Admiral Dewey in an official report to the 
 Navy Department declared the Filipinos more capable of self government than the Cubans 
 and said that he based his opinion upon a knowledge of both races But I will not rest the case 
 upon the relative advancement of the Filipinos Henry Clay in defending the right of the 
 people of South America to self government said  
 It is the doctrine of thrones that man is too ignorant to govern himself Their partisans 
 assert his incapacity in reference to all nations if they can not command universal 
 assent to the proposition it is then demanded to particular nations and our pride and 
 our presumption too often make converts of us I contend that it is to arraign the 
 disposition of Providence himself to suppose that he has created beings incapable of

 governing themselves and to be trampled  government is the natural 
 government of man  
 Clay was right There are degrees of proficiency in the art of self government but it is a 
 reflection upon the Creator to say that he denied to any people the capacity for self- 
 government Once admit that some people are capable of self government and that others are 
 not and that the capable people have a right to seize upon and govern the incapable and you 
 make force brute force the only foundation of government and invite the reign of a 
 despot I am not willing to believe that an all wise and an all loving God created the Filipinos 
 and then left them thousands of years helpless until the islands attracted the attention of 
 European nations  
 Republicans ask Shall we haul down the flag that floats over our dead in the Philippines 
 The same question might have been asked when the American flag floated over Chapultepec 
 and waved over the dead who fell there but the tourist who visits the City of Mexico finds 
 there a national cemetery   States and cared   citizen  
 Our flag still floats over our dead but when the treaty with Mexico was signed American 
 authority withdrew to the Rio Grande and I venture the opinion that during the last fifty years 
 the people of Mexico have made more progress under the stimulus of independence and self- 
 government than they would have made under a carpet bag government held in place by 
 bayonets The United States and Mexico friendly republics are each stronger and happier 
 than they would have been had the former been cursed and the latter crushed by an 
 imperialistic policy disguised as benevolent assimilation  
 Can we not govern colonies we are asked   The question is not what we can do but what 
 we ought to do   This nation can do whatever it desires to do but it must accept responsibility 
 for what it does   If the Constitution stands in the way the people can amend the 
 Constitution   I repeat the nation can do whatever it desires to do but it can not avoid the 
 natural and legitimate results of it own conduct  
 The young man upon reaching his majority can do what he pleases   He can disregard the 
 teachings of his parents he can trample upon all that he has been taught to consider sacred 
 he can disobey the laws of the State the laws of society and the laws of God   He can stamp 
 failure upon his life and make his very existence a curse to his fellow men and he can bring 
 his father and mother in sorrow to the grave but he can not annul the sentence The wages 
 of sin is death 
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       4 
 And so with the nation   It is of age and it can do what it pleases it can spurn the traditions of 
 the past it can repudiate the principles upon which the nation rests it can employ force 
 instead of reason it can substitute might for right it can conquer weaker people it can 
 exploit their lands appropriate their property and kill their people but it can not repeal the 
 moral law or escape the punishment decreed for the violation of human rights  
 Would we tread in the paths of tyranny  
 Nor reckon the tyrant 's cost  
 Who taketh another 's liberty  
 His freedom is also lost  
 Would we win as the strong have ever won  
 Make ready to pay the debt  
 For the God who reigned over Babylon  
 Is the God who is reigning yet  
 Some argue that American rule in the Philippine Islands will result in the better education of 
 the Filipinos   Be not deceived If we expect to maintain a colonial policy we shall not find it to 
 our advantage to educate the people   The educated Filipinos are now in revolt against us and 
 the most ignorant ones have made the least resistance to our domination   If we are to 
 govern them without their consent and give them no voice in determining the taxes which 
 they must pay we dare not educate them lest they learn to read the Declaration of 
 Independence and Constitution of the United States and mock us for our inconsistency  
 The principal arguments however   enter upon a defense of 
 imperialism are  
 First That we must improve the present opportunity to become a world power and enter 
 into international politics  
 Second That our commercial interests in the Philippine Islands and in the Orient make it 
 necessary for us to hold the islands permanently  
  
  
 
                                                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                                         
       5 
 Third That the spread of the Christian religion will be   policy  
 Fourth That there is no honorable retreat from the position which the nation has taken  
 The first argument is addressed to the nation ’s pride and the second to the nation ’s pocket- 
 book   The third is intended for the church member and the fourth for the partisan  
 It is sufficient answer to the first argument to say that for more than a century this nation has 
 been a world power   For ten decades it has been the most potent influence in the world Not 
 only has it been a world power but it has done more to shape the politics of the human race 
 than all the other nations of the world combined   Because our Declaration of Independence 
 was promulgated others have been promulgated   Because the patriots of 1776 fought for 
 liberty other have fought for it   Because our Constitution was adopted other constitutions 
 have been adopted  
 The growth of the principle of self government planted on American soil has been the 
 overshadowing political fact of the nineteenth century   It has made this nation conspicuous 
 among the nations and given it a place in history such as no other nation has ever enjoyed  
 Nothing has been able to check the onward march of this idea   I am not willing that this 
 nation shall cast aside the omnipotent weapon of truth to seize again the weapons of physical 
 warfare   I would not exchange the glory of this Republic for the glory of all empires that have 
 risen and fallen since time began  
 The permanent chairman of the last Republican Nation Convention presented the pecuniary 
 argument in all its baldness when he said  
 We make no hypocritical pretense of being interested in the Philippines solely on 
 account of others   While we regard the welfare of those people as a sacred trust we 
 regard the welfare of American people first   We see our duty to ourselves as well as to 
 others   We believe in trade expansion By every legitimate means within the province 
 of government and constitution we mean to stimulate the expansion of our trade and 
 open new markets  
 This is the commercial argument It is based upon the theory that war can be rightly waged 
 for pecuniary advantage and that it is profitable to purchase   violence 
 Franklin denied both of these propositions   When Lord Howe asserted that the acts of 
 Parliament which brought on the Revolution were necessary to prevent American trade from 
 passing into foreign channels Franklin replied

 To me it seems that neither the obtaining nor retaining of any trade howsoever 
 valuable is an object for which men may justly spill each other 's blood that the true 
 and sure means of extending and securing commerce are the goodness and cheapness 
 of commodities and that the profits of no trade can ever be equal to the expense of 
 compelling it and holding   armies I consider this war against us 
 therefore as both unjust and unwise  
 I place the philosophy of Franklin against the sordid doctrine of those who would put a price 
 upon the head of an American soldier and justify a war of conquest upon the ground that it 
 will pay The democratic party is in favor of the expansion of trade It would extend our trade 
 by every legitimate and peaceful means but it is not willing to make merchandise of human 
 blood  
 But a war of conquest is as unwise as it is unrighteous A harbor and coaling station in the 
 Philippines would answer every trade and military necessity and such a concession could have 
 been secured at any time without difficulty  
 It is not necessary to own people in order to trade with them We carry on trade today with 
 every part of the world and our commerce has expanded more rapidly than the commerce of 
 any European empire We do not own Japan or China but we trade with their people We 
 have not absorbed the republics of Central and South America but we trade with them It has 
 not been necessary to have any political connection with Canada or the nations of Europe in 
 order to trade with them Trade can not be permanently profitable unless it is voluntary  
 When trade is  cost of securing it and retaining it must be taken out of 
 the profits and the profits are never large enough to cover the expense Such a system would 
 never be defended but for the fact that the expense is   people while the 
 profits are   
 Imperialism would be profitable to the army contractors it would be profitable to the ship 
 owners who would carry live soldiers to the Philippines and bring dead soldiers back it would 
 be profitable to those who would seize upon the franchises and it would be profitable to the 
 officials whose salaries would be fixed here and paid over there but to the farmer to the 
 laboring man and to the vast majority of those engaged in other occupations it would bring 
 expenditure without return and risk without reward

 Farmers and laboring men have as a rule small incomes and under systems which place the 
 tax upon consumption pay much more than their fair share of the expenses of government 
 Thus the very people who receive least benefit from imperialism will be injured most by the 
 military burdens which accompany it  
 In addition to the evils which he and the farmer share in common the laboring man will be 
 the first to suffer if oriental subjects seek work in the United States the first to suffer if 
 American capital leaves our shores to employ oriental labor in the Philippines to supply the 
 trade of China and Japan the first to suffer from the violence which the military spirit arouses 
 and the first to suffer when the methods of imperialism are applied to our own government  
 It is not strange therefore that the labor organizations have been quick to note the approach 
 of these dangers and prompt to protest against both militarism and imperialism  
 The pecuniary argument the more effective with certain classes is not likely to be used so 
 often or presented with so much enthusiasm as the religious argument   If what has been 
 termed the gunpowder gospel were urged against the Filipinos only it would be a sufficient 
 answer to say that a majority of the Filipinos are now members of one branch of the Christian 
 church but the principle involved is one of much wider application and challenges serious 
 consideration  
 The religious argument varies in positiveness from a passive belief that Providence delivered 
 the Filipinos into our hands for their good and our glory to the exultation of the minister who 
 said that we ought to thrash the natives Filipinos until they understand who we are and 
 that every bullet sent every cannon shot and every flag waved means righteousness  
 We can not approve of this doctrine in one place unless we are willing to apply it everywhere  
 If there is poison in the blood of the hand it will ultimately reach the heat   It is equally true 
 that forcible Christianity if planted under the American flag in the far away Orient will sooner 
 or later be transplanted upon American soil  
 If true Christianity consists in carrying out in our daily lives the teachings of Christ who will 
 say that we are commanded to civilize with dynamite and proselyte with the sword   He who 
 would declare the divine will must prove his authority    a 
 special dispensation

 Imperialism finds no warrant in the Bible   The command Go ye into all the world and preach 
 the gospel to every creature has no Gatling gun attachment   When Jesus visited a village of 
 Samaria and the people refused to receive him some of the disciples suggested that fire 
 should be called down from Heaven to avenge the insult but the Master rebuked them and 
 said   Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of for the Son of Man is not come to destroy 
 men ’s lives but to save them   Suppose he had said We will thrash them until they 
 understand who we are how different would have been the history of Christianity   Compare 
 if you will the swaggering bullying brutal doctrine of imperialism with the golden rule and 
 the commandment Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself  
 Love not force was the weapon of the Nazarene sacrifice for others not the exploitation of 
 them was His method of reaching the human heart   A missionary recently told me that the 
 Stars and Stripes once saved his life because his assailant recognized our flag as a flag that 
 had no blood upon it  
 Let it be known that our missionaries are seeking souls instead of sovereignty let be it known 
 that instead of being the advance guard of conquering armies they are going forth to help 
 and uplift having their loins girt about with the truth and their feet shod with the preparation 
 of the gospel of peace wearing the breastplate of righteousness and carrying the sword of the 
 spirit let it be known that they are citizens of a nation which respects the rights of the 
 citizens of other nations as carefully as it protects the rights of its own citizens and the 
 welcome given to our missionaries will be more cordial than the welcome extended to the 
 missionaries of any other nation  
 The argument   it was unfortunate for the nation that it had anything to do 
 with the Philippine Islands but that the naval victory at Manila made the permanent 
 acquisition of those islands necessary is also unsound We won a naval victory at Santiago 
 but that did not compel us to hold Cuba  
 The shedding of American blood in the Philippine Islands does not make it imperative that we 
 should retain possession forever American blood was shed at San Juan and El Caney and yet 
 the President has promised the Cubans independence The fact that the American flag floats 
 over Manila does not compel us to exercise perpetual sovereignty over the islands the 
 American flag floats over Havana to day but the President has promised to haul it down when 
 the flag of the Cuban Republic is ready to rise in its place   Better a thousand times that our 
 flag in the Orient give way to a flag representing the idea of self government than that the 
 flag of this Republic should become the flag of an empire

 There is an easy honest honorable solution of the Philippine question It is set forth in the 
 Democratic platform and it is submitted with confidence to the American people   This plan I 
 unreservedly indorse   If elected I will convene Congress in extraordinary session as soon as 
 inaugurated and recommend an immediate declaration of the nation ’s purpose first to 
 establish a stable form of government in the Philippine Islands just as we are now 
 establishing a stable form of government in Cuba second to give independence to the 
 Filipinos as we have promised to give independence to the Cubans third to protect the 
 Filipinos from outside interference while they work out their destiny just as we have protected 
 the republics of Central and South America and  doctrine pledged to 
 protect Cuba  
 A European protectorate often results in the plundering of the    An 
 American protectorate gives to the nation protected the advantage of our strength without 
 making it he victim of our greed   For three quarters of a century the Monroe doctrine has 
 been a shield to neighboring republics and yet it has imposed no pecuniary burden upon us 
 After the Filipinos had aided us in the war against Spain we could not leave them to be the 
 victims of the ambitious designs of European nations and since we do not desire to make 
 them a part of us or to hold them as subjects we propose the only alternative namely to 
 give them independence and guard them against molestation from without  
 When our opponents are unable to defend their   fall back upon the 
 assertion that is destiny and insist that we must submit to it no matter how much it violates 
 our moral percepts and our principles of government This is a complacent philosophy   It 
 obliterates the distinction between right and wrong and makes individuals and nations the 
 helpless victims of circumstance  
 Destiny is the subterfuge of the invertebrate who lacking the courage to oppose error seeks 
 some plausible excuse for supporting it   Washington said that the destiny of the republican 
 form of government was deeply if not finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the 
 American people   How different Washington ’s definition of destiny from the Republican 
 definition  
 The Republicans say that this nation is in the hands of destiny Washington believed that not 
 only the destiny of our own nation but the destiny of the republican form of government 
 throughout the world was intrusted to American hands   Immeasurable responsibility   The 
 destiny of this Republic is in the hands of its own people and upon the success of the 
 experiment here rests the hope of humanity   No exterior force can disturb this Republic and 
 no foreign influence should be permitted to change its course   What the future has in store

 for this nation no one has authority to declare but each individual has his own idea of the 
 nation ’s mission and he owes it to his country as well as to himself to contribute as best he 
 may to the fulfillment of that mission  
 Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee I can never fully discharge the debt of 
 gratitude which I owe to my countrymen for the honors which they have so generously 
 bestowed upon me but sirs whether it be my lot to occupy the high office for which the 
 convention has named me or to spend the remainder of my days in private life it shall be my 
 constant ambition and my controlling purpose to aid in realizing the high ideals of those whose 
 wisdom and courage and sacrifices brought the Republic into existence  
 I can conceive of a national destiny surpassing the glories of the present and the past a 
 destiny which meets the responsibility of today and measures up to the possibilities of the 
 future 
 Behold a republic resting securely upon the foundation stones quarried by revolutionary 
 patriots from the mountain of eternal truth a republic applying in practice and proclaiming 
 to the world the self evident propositions that all men are created equal that they are 
 endowed with inalienable rights that governments are instituted among men to secure these 
 rights and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed 
 Behold a republic in which civil and religion liberty stimulate all to earnest endeavor and in 
 which the law restrains every hand uplifted for a neighbor 's injury a republic in which every 
 citizen is a sovereign but in which no one cares to wear a crown 
 Behold a republic standing erect while empires all around are bowed beneath the weight of 
 their own armaments a republic whose flag is loved while other flags are only feared 
 Behold a republic increasing in population in wealth in strength and in influence solving the 
 problems of civilization and hastening the coming of an universal brotherhood a republic 
 which shakes thrones and dissolves   example and gives light and 
 inspiration to those who sit in darkness 
 Behold a republic gradually but surely becoming the supreme moral factor in the world 's 
 progress and the accepted arbiter of the world 's disputes a republic whose history like the 
 path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day",0.1041847914457321,0.0402560494840145,0.282344788312912,0.1351760923862457,0.2816290557384491,0.1121783778071403,0.04423089325428,0.1215048726007629,0.4194555558596656,37.510691182670485,0.2070536952645135,0.010506303782269362,0.05594734367653973,0.020397092329391343,33.31333333333333,1.0
62,Elizabeth Gurley Flynn,Statement at the Smith Act Trial,1952," 
 
 Your Honor ladies and gentlemen my name is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn   I am a defendant in 
 this case acting as my own attorney and therefore have the opportunity to address you 
 directly   It is unusual for a defendant to represent one ’s self but my comrade Mr. Pettis 
 Perry and I have elected to do so   Neither of us is a lawyer   We will speak to you in the 
 language of laymen and women I should say 
 We are both Communist leaders proudly and avowedly   We are qualified to explain to you 
 what the Communist Party of the U.S.A. really stands for what it advocates what its day by- 
 day activities are and what are its ultimate aims   We will try to do so in simple non technical 
 language   We will prove to you that we are not a criminal conspiracy but a 33 year old 
 working class political party devoted to the immediate needs and aspirations of the American 
 people to the advancement of the workers farmers and the Negro people to the 
 preservation of the democracy and culture and to the advocacy of Socialism 
 Our ideas may be new and strange to you   Probably you have never seen or met a 
 Communist before   We do n’t ask you to agree with us but to listen with an open mind and not 
 to accept as gospel truth the sensational tales of stool pigeons and planted agents who will be 
 the Government ’s chief if not sole witnesses 
  
  
 
                                                      
 Centuries ago Judas became the symbol of such infamy a forerunner of those who join a 
 group of sincere and honest people advocate its teachings carry out its practices only to 
 betray it 
                                                                         
 We will prove to you that we who stand ready to make extreme sacrifices for what we believe 
 are giving you a true picture of the purposes of the Communist Party It is customary for a 
 client to be introduced to the   her attorney   I am my own attorney I must 
 therefore introduce myself   I am an American of Irish decent   My father Thomas Flynn was 
 born in Maine   My mother Anne Gurley was born in Galway Ireland   I was born in Concord 
 New Hampshire 62 years ago   I married in 1908 separated from my husband shortly 
 thereafter and have always used my own name   My only son Fred died in 1940 at the age 
 of 29 from a chest cancer   I reside with my sister who is a retired school teacher   We have 
 lived in New York City for the past 52 years   My mother was a skilled tailoress my father a 
 quarry worker who worked his way through the engineering school at Dartmouth College in 
 New Hampshire   My father grandfather and all my uncles were members of labor unions 
                                                                              
 To continue ladies and gentlemen one of the essential issues in this case is my individual 
 intent the intent with which I joined the Communist Party and have remained a member of it 
 and the intent with which I have tried to carry out its program My intent has been shaped out 
 of my earlier experiences and my reaction   to the conditions of life especially the conditions of 
 the worker 
 By showing you what my intent is and what in my life shaped the intent I shall show you that 
 never have I and not now do I intend to advocate the overthrow of  
 violence nor do I intend to bring about such overthrow 
 I come from a family whose  included important social issues of the day and 
 form this I early learned to question things as they are and to seek improvements Thus my 
 mother advocated Women ’s Suffrage and my father and mother 
                                                                         
 and my father and mother discussed with their children the campaigns of Debs the 
 Socialist candidate for President 
  
  
 
                                                      
 My father read aloud to me and to my brother and sisters such books as the Communist 
 Manifesto and other writings of Marx and Engels which the Government will use as evidence 
 in this trial 
 I was a serious child due probably to these childish impressions which are background to my 
 affiliation in my extreme youth with the Socialist movement and in my mature years with the 
 Communist Party 
 Times were hard   We were poor   My first experience with discrimination was in Manchester 
 New Hampshire when my father ran for city engineer about 1895   I heard it said he was 
 defeated because he was Irish   He was very bitter on this subject and told us of signs on 
 factories when he was a boy No Irish need apply 
 Our parents opposed all forms of national religious or color discrimination which we will 
 prove is identical with the position of the Communist Party today and form the basis of the 
 position I take today in the Communist Party 
 My first knowledge of the meaning of imperialism which will be an issue in this case was a 
 vivid recollection of my father ’s opposition to the Spanish American War and his insistence on 
 the right of the Cuban and Philippine peoples to their independence   He joined an anti- 
 imperialist league to protest against our country embarking on the evil path of imperialism 
 which we will prove began at that time 
 The conditions in the textile towns of New Hampshire and Massachusetts contributed to my 
 later joining the Communist Party which as Mr. Lane says concentrates on the recruiting of 
 workers in industry huge gray mills like prisons barrack like company boarding houses long 
 hours low wages long periods of slack the prosperous owner lived in the center of Adams 
 Massachusetts and rode around in his fine carriage with its beautiful horses I saw lard 
 instead of butter on neighbors tables children without underwear in cold New England 
 winters a girl   machine in a mill across the street from our school I 
 saw an old man weeping as they put him in the lockup as a tramp 
 Then we came to live in the drab South Bronx near the New Haven Railroad ’s roundhouse in 
 a cold water unheated gas lit flat Casualties and accidents were high among the railroad 
 workers   Children were maimed as they gathered coal in the yards in bad times My mother 
 helped women in the neighborhood who could not afford a doctor when a baby came 
                                                                         
  
  
 
                                                      
 Yes I was greatly    Why did good hard working people suffer so   Why 
 were men who were willing able and anxious to work denied jobs   Why was there so much 
 unemployment   Why were there rich people who apparently did little but enjoyed life   I 
 hated poverty   I saw my mother humiliated when unpaid grocery bills could not be met and 
 the landlord stood at the door demanding his rent 
                                                                         
 I joined a debating society in P.S. 9 in the lower Bronx   I won a medal in a debate on the 
 subject Should the Government own the mines   I said Yes it should 
 This was during the great anthracite coal strike in 1902   I attended Bronx Socialist meeting in 
 1905 later at the Harlem Socialist Club at 125th Street   My speaking career started in 1906 
 on the ambitious subject of women under socialism Naturally I drew heavily on authors 
 American women like Charlotte Petingill and Susan B. Anthony also on a book written in 
 1872 by Augustus Bebel a Socialist member of the German Reichstag written while he was in 
 prison under Bismarck ’s anti Socialist law   It was first published   Labor 
 Party in 1904   I am puzzled to see it on the Government ’s list of documents   What relation it 
 has to this indictment is hard to fathom unless to advocate the full political economic and 
 social emancipation of women has become a form of advocacy of the overthrow of 
  violence under the Government ’s interpretation of the Smith 
 Act But if this historic and economic study which is very much out of date today is to be 
 finely tooth combed for sentences which torn out of context can distort its meaning this we 
 will prove can be done to any book no matter what its purpose even to the Bible 
 Shakespeare or Gray ’s Anatomy 
 My youthful ambition believe it or not was to be a constitutional lawyer   Instead I became a 
 labor organizer   Then it was call an agitator  one who stirred up the people  
 I was determined to do something about the bad conditions under which our family and all 
 around us suffered   I have stuck to that purpose for 46 years   I consider in so doing I have 
 been a good American   I have spent my life among the American workers all over this 
 country slept in their homes eaten at their tables   They are the majority of the people who 
 have the inalienable right in our view to govern the country   We  who do 
 useful work of hand or brain   My life work began when I joined the I.W.W. Industrial 
 Workers of the World in 1906 a pioneer in industrial unions which flashed like a great comet 
 across the horizon of the American labor movement for nearly two decades   I returned as an 
 I.W.W. organizer in 1912 to New England my birthplace where the I.W.W. led historical 
 textile strikes in Lawrence Lowell and New Bedford Massachusetts   The strikes were 
  
  
 
                                                      
 unorganized largely foreign born men and women whose wages were cut when their hours 
 were  
                                                                         
 In 1913 I was a leader in the Paterson New Jersey silk strike in 1916 in a strike of the iron 
 ore miners on the Mesaba range in Minnesota where the mines are S. Street 
 trust I will attempt to prove to you that it is not the Communists who advocate and use force 
 and violence   I saw it used in all of these labor struggles   but by police 
 company guards and State militia   I saw workers clubbed beaten and shot down I spoke 
                                                                         
 My travels as a Communist speaker have taken me all over the country   I saw the fruits of a 
 lawless aggressive brutal and ruthless capitalism which garnered profits for a few at the 
 expense of the many 
 Our country is a rich and beautiful country fully capable of producing plenty for all educating 
 its youth and caring for its aged We believe it could do this under Socialism I saw great 
 forests cut down and the denuded land left with blackened stumps miles of top soil blown and 
 washed away and fertile fields became like a desert 
 I have seen textile workers who wove beautiful woolen fabrics shivering for lack of warm 
 clothing and coal miners living in cold shacks in company towns and steel towns that were 
 armed camps   I saw men black listed driven from town to town forced to change their 
 names because they had dared to try to organize a union 
 We will prove to you that it is not the Communists who have advocated or practiced force and 
 violence but that it is the employing class which has done both throughout the history of my 
 life in the American labor movement like General Sherman Bell who said in Colorado during a 
 miner ’s strike To Hell with habeas corpus we ’ll give them post mortems 
 We will prove to you that 
                                                                         
 We will prove to you that it is nor we who flaunt the Constitution and the Bill of Rights but 
 that is has always been   class   We will prove that we are fighting here 
  
  
 
                                                      
 for our constitutional and democratic rights not to advocate force and violence but to expose 
 and stop its use against the people 
 We will demonstrate that in fighting for our rights we believe we are defending the 
 constitutional rights of all Americans We believe we are acting as good Americans 
 Since six out of eleven of my writings in Political Affairs   deal with 
 what is called defense I will prove to you that this has been a part of my life work since 1907 
 before there was a Communist Party 
 For example I distributed thousands of copies of a famous document in the 20 ’s called 
 Illegal Practices of the Department of Justice which is not among the Government ’s exhibits 
 of old time documents but which I would gladly offer to the jury It was  
 the most prominent lawyers of that period including Professors Frankfurter and Chafee of 
 Harvard and Francis Fisher Kane who resigned his post as United States Attorney in 
 Philadelphia in protest against such proceedings 
 I early engaged in struggles to win free speech on the streets and in halls This early 
 identification with civil liberties led to my becoming a charter member of the American Civil 
 liberties Union in 1917 and later the organizer of the Workers Defense Union a delegate body 
 from unions and fraternal organizations which furnished legal defense in political and labor 
 prosecutions 
 We had plenty to do during the infamous 1920 Palmer Red Raids   We defended Socialist I 
 defended Socialists 
                                                                         
 I worked for seven years in the unsuccessful struggles to save the lives of Sacco and 
 Vanzetti In the Government ’s list of exhibits is an article I wrote in August 1947 entitled 
 Sacco and Vanzetti Twenty Years After in which I pointed out the worldwide belief in their 
 innocence 
                                                                         
 
  
  
 
                                                      
 Now I will show how and why I left the I.W.W. and joined the Communist Party   This bears 
 directly on the issue of forcible overthrow of the government that Mr. Lane spoke to you about 
 this morning   After careful reflection it became clear to me that the I.W.W. was an anarcho- 
 syndicalist organization   The I.W.W. wanted to bring Socialism within Capitalism and then 
 break through the shell of   strike and the seizing and possession of 
 industry Now it was precisely this position that I rejected 
 I came to the conclusion that Socialism could be achieved   of violence but 
 by the persistent political activities of the workers and the people   And so in order to 
 participate in political activities in the effort to achieve Socialism I joined the Communist 
 Party   In doing this I got back into the labor movement and stopped being what I then had 
 decided was anarchistic 
                                                                         
 As to the origin of the Communist Party we will show here that there developed within the 
 Socialist Party an organized Left wing movement until by 1919 it was the majority of that 
 party 
 At the Chicago convention of the Socialist Party a split occurred   The Left wing ejected by the 
 police reorganized as the Communist Party   The Left wing was the majority of the old 
 Socialist Party 
 All of my Socialist friends and associates were Left wingers   I was in great sympathy with 
 them 
 By 1926 I had become convinced that the Communist Party was the logical inheritor of all the 
 best traditions history and struggles of the older Socialist movement and of the I.W.W. too  
 I was ready to join the party and gave an application to Charles Ruthenberg then the 
 secretary of the Communist Party in 1926 
 Due to his sudden death a few weeks later during the most critical period of my own illness 
 that application was apparently lost   Anyhow it was never presented to the Party   I was ill of 
 heart trouble in Portland Oregon at that time 
 While there I was in constant touch with my old friends Ella Reeve Bloor and Anita Whitney 
 of California both Communist leaders 
  
  
 
                                                      
 Naturally my heart and mind although I was ill were deeply involved in the current political 
 problems of the people the menace of Fascism in Europe the great struggles of the 
 unemployment Amter Minor Dennis and others and later the new 
 unions which were present during the New Deal of President Roosevelt 
 Miss Whitney brought me a Daily Worker in the fall of 1935 with a 
 called The United Front Against War and Fascism which the Government has stated it 
 intends offering in evidence   This speech made a deep impression on me 
 We will show the character of Communist work in the struggle against fascism in answer to 
 this clarion call of Dimitroff who died in 1949 as premier of his country   We will show the 
 background of this speech which is essential in order for you to understand its meaning and 
 the intent with which I then joined the Communist Party 
 This was the time of the rise of fascism which we will show seemed very remote to most 
 people in our country in the 30 ’s People laughed at Hitler and Mussolini as demagogues and 
 mountebanks but it caused great concern to the peoples of Europe especially to the 
 Communists in those countries directly affected or threatened 
 George Dimitroff was a Bulgarian Communist who had been in exile in Germany and while 
 there was framed in the infamous Reichstag fire case 
                                                                         
 Dimitroff was freed   He took refuge in the Soviet Union where he delivered this speech in 
 1935 at the Congress of the Communist International   It is an eloquent and dramatic appeal 
 to fight fascism which he describes as the most vicious enemy of mankind   It is addressed to 
 Communists especially and other progressive people elsewhere to put aside all immediate 
 partisan or sectarian interest or differences or ultimate political aims to unite to stop fascism  
 We will prove that this is what is  
 This policy brought Communists together with all other honest and patriotic people who were 
 determined to save their country from the ravages of fascism   We will show that Hank 
 Forbes one of our party organizers who might otherwise be here as a defendant lost his life 
 at the Anzio Beachhead in pursuance of that policy as did hundreds of American Communists 
 in World War II 
  
  
 
                                                      
 I resolved when I read this powerful appeal Here is where I belong   As soon as I am well I 
 will again apply to join the Communist Party   I did so   William Z. Foster whom I first met in 
 1909 in the I.W.W. and Ella Reeve Bloor whom I knew from the old Socialist Party 
 presented my application in the winter of 1936 and 1937 It was accepted and publicly 
 announced in the press 
 In my extreme youth I had affiliated myself with the nonpolitical I.W.W. in my maturity I 
 came back into the working class political movement of socialism   This may seem a very 
 lengthy introduction but I have tried to draw conclusions from my biography on the issues in 
 this case   I did not intend it to be personal but and explanation of how and why I became a 
 Communist   And I am an example not and exception 
 Now as to my official position in the Communist Party which I gladly and proudly 
 acknowledge they are a matter of public record in 1938 I became and am today a member 
 of the National Committee of the Communist Party   The National Committee was reduced in 
 1948 to 13   The other 12 members are William Z. Foster our chairman who has been 
 seriously ill for several years and my dear comrades the 11 Communist leaders convicted 
 under the Smith Act which they challenged as unconstitutional   I have also been chairman of 
 the Women ’s Committee of the Communist Party since 1945 which the evidence will show 
 carries on struggle for equal rights for women in shops unions and all organizations even 
 including our own party when necessary 
 My comrade Claudia Jones a defendant here is the executive secretary   We have worked 
 together spoken together written and helped organize women for full equality both 
 politically and economically for the building of movements for peace consumers councils 
 parent teachers organizations and similar organizations for the unity of Negro and white 
 women and to overcome the exploitation of Negro women as workers as women as 
 Negroes 
 Many articles which both of us have written on these subjects are featured in the 
 Government ’s list of exhibits   We will demonstrate to you how constructive and beneficial is 
 the nature of our work among women inspiring them to greater self confidence greater 
 comradeship with one another greater participation in public affairs   The evidence will show 
 further that we have urged the organization of women for political activity not only on 
 Election Day but the year around in hearings delegations petitions and statements to all 
 legislative and public bodies on such issues as child care better schools better housing a 
 better standard of living etc 
  
  
 
                                                      0 
 We have written of the history of the women ’s movement in our country where every right 
 we now enjoy has been won   the right of women to vote to 
 serve on juries protective labor legislation for women workers mothers pensions and so 
 forth 
 We have directed our sharpest criticism to the virtual disfranchisement of the southern Negro 
  violence and through the pool tax discrimination against women in 
 factories lack of upbringing etc 
 We have advocated socialism as a system of society best guaranteeing to women full equal 
 rights in all spheres and insuring to them the possibility of exercising these rights 
 I remind you again that we are not asking you to agree with us but will prove to you that we 
 have not been advocating force and violence but rather a peaceful happy world 
 I have also been chairman of the defense committee of the Party since 1948 when our 
 leaders previously referred to were arrested   The evidence will show that our duties my 
 duties were to raise funds necessary for adequate legal defense of our members who might 
 be arrested under the Smith Act or held for deportation under the McCarran Act   Individual 
 Communists are not financially able to defend themselves   These duties are ours   Our duties 
 were to publicize the facts in the case since newspaper coverage is notoriously inadequate 
 and invariably prejudiced to organized mass meetings arrange tours for speakers and 
 generally call for public support for their defense 
                                                                         
 In addition the Government ’s list of documents which they told us they would introduce in 
 this case or indicated they would introduce in this case makes clear to you will make clear to 
 you that I am a columnist of the Daily Worker   This is correct   For 15 years form 1937 to 
 date I have produced at least two columns a week besides many feature articles for the 
 Sunday paper   The Worker   These are my personal columns and are not submitted to the 
 editorial staff in advance   Praise or criticism comes from the readers   Some of my columns 
 and articles are   as Government ’s exhibits which they intend to 
 introduce If they are to prove my official position in our Party or my tours around the country 
 or that I spoke in any specific places or that I invited people to join the Communist Party the 
 Government need not waste its time   I do not deny any of these things   The evidence will 
 show that I asked people to join it   I believe in the Party to which I belong   It is a legal Party 
 in my estimation devoted to the best interest of the people and I would not belong to it if I 
  
  
 
                                                      1 
 would hesitate to ask any honest persons to join me   Hundreds did so at my invitation   I 
 would be glad to make available to the jury at the appropriate time not just a few articles 
 carefully culled for the Government ’s purposes but all of them dealing with a vast range of 
 subjects 
 I will prove to you thereby that there is no advocacy of force and violence in any one of them 
                                                                         
 I have also written a dozen pamphlets during the past period  
                                                                         
 One is called Stool Pigeon   Another The Plot to Gag America 
 The Government did not list them for your attention   I recommend especially that you do 
 read one of their listed documents if and when it is presented the eloquent and able 
 opening remarks of Eugene Dennis General Secretary of the Communist Party when he stood 
 here as I am standing now defending himself before another jury   I wrote an introduction to 
 it   It is called The Case for the Communist Party   The Government has indicated that it 
 intends offering it in evidence possibly for this reason   I am glad that the Government will 
 make it available to you and would be happy to follow congressional example and ask that this 
 speech of Eugene Dennis be considered an extension of my remarks 
                                                                         
 I have handbills advertisements and press clipping relative to hundreds of public mass 
 meetings   Party at which I and other defendants have spoken in 
 the past 15 years   We will prove that nowhere has there been any advocacy of force and 
 violence   The subject matter of such meetings should interest this jury I believe however as 
 evidence of our intent 
 Take some at random   The Struggle Against the Taft Hartley Law The Rights of the 
 Negro People  
                                                                         
  
  
 
                                                      2 
 I and other defendants have spoken during the period   and 
 previously on the radio especially in political campaigns in support of Communist and other 
 candidates including Councilmen Cacchione and Davis and for Simon W. Gerson a defendant 
 present here when he was a candidate after Mr. Cacchione ’s sudden death 
 We will prove to you that the Communist Party U.S.A. is not as the indictment sets forth a 
 society group or assembly of persons but is a legitimate political party   It has nominated 
 candidates for all public offices including that of President We will prove that defendants here 
 on trial have been candidates and won substantially high votes Perry Gerson Begun 
 Johnson Weinstone and Weinstock 
 I ran with Mr. Benjamin J. Davis for Congress at large in 1942 and we each received over 
 50,000 votes 
 Our campaign slogan or program for victory was  
 Not an idle man Not an idle machine Not an idle acre 
 Mr. Gerson received 150,000 votes in Brooklyn in 1948  
 One of the defendants in the current Los Angeles Smith Act trial a known Communist Miss 
 Bernadette Doyle received over 600,000 votes for a state wide office as a peace candidate 
 Our evidence will prove how the Communist Party operates politically   We are a party of a 
 new type in that we are not before the people just to capture their votes   We will prove that 
 we are politically active the year round We have attended public hearings as Communist 
 spokesmen for instance I appeared with Mr. Gerson before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
 to oppose the appointment of Tom Clarke to the Supreme Court 
 If our Party along with other minority parties were not  electoral 
 restrictions and barred from the ballot in some states we believe firmly we would win many 
 more votes and elect candidates to Congress 
 Communists are represented in the Parliaments of all major non fascist countries in the world 
 today 
 This is the arena where political views belong in the marketplace of public discussion to be 
 passed upon   
  
  
 
                                                      3 
 The Government obviously intends to make much of the fact that occasionally we spoke in 
 somebody ’s home to a selected group of people   In reference to such house gatherings and 
 some were purely social we will show that these are some of the reasons 
 Sometimes it was because no hall could be rented and in small one industry towns like steel 
 coal and textiles people seen at a Communist   would lose their jobs 
 and be black listed and even the unions would not be able to protect these members 
 Sometimes we held them in homes for the convenience of women who could not attend 
 otherwise   Sometimes it was for the protection of Negro people especially in the South and 
 border state areas that the speaker goes to them rather than expecting them to come to the 
 speaker   We will show that we consider it our duty as Communists to protect workers 
 members and non members alike from harassment loss of jobs threats of violence or FBI 
 surveillance and just because they come to our meetings   Wherever possible our meetings 
 were open with the public and the press invited   Sometimes unfortunately Communists are 
 driven to privacy as protection against persecution 
 Criticism should not be directed to us but at those who create the repressive conditions which 
 we will prove forces workers to choose between their jobs and their beliefs   We will prove 
 and I can assure you that no member of our party but what would be happy and willing to 
 publicly declare his or her membership if the same rights and protection were accorded to us 
 as to all others engaged in political activity in our country 
 The Government will also make much of schools as Mr. Lane has already indicated where 
 Marxism Leninism was taught 
 I gave lectures at certain schools in New York City Pittsburgh Philadelphia Cleveland and at 
 a national training school   My topics were either History of the Labor Movement or History 
 of the Women ’s Movement in the U.S.A.   I have the outlines which I used in these courses 
 which are analytical and explanatory and I will because they are only brief I will offer 
 them in evidence in this case 
 A course on the History of the American Labor Movement delivered at the Jefferson School 
 of New York is presented here as the overt act of Mr. Louis Weinstock 
 This brings us to the skeleton upon which this case is built a strange new type of overt act 
 suggestive if I may say so of Nazi book burning   They set forth 
  
  
 
                                                      4 
                                                                         
 They set forth we believe activities which are the ordinary everyday acts of all organizations 
 and individuals who seek to present their views in the marketplace of ideas 
 Of 29 overt acts 11 are articles in the magazine Political Affairs 
 5 are Daily Worker articles 
 5 including mine are public meetings 
 2 are committee meetings 
 2 are classes 
 One is leaving a building 
 One is mailing letters 
 One is writing a pamphlet 
 One is becoming a party organizer 
 The Government will attempt to clothe them too   I presume in the so called Aesopian 
 language or no matter what we said we really meant its opposite It is quite a Houdini like 
 performance to say peace to a mass meeting of 10,000 people and mean war 
 Mr. Perry and I and our co defendants will try in the evidence we submit as this case 
 progresses to cut through the maze of what we consider misrepresentations in relation to 
 Aesopian language and to make it clear that what that we say what we mean and we mean 
 what we say and that the language of Marxism Leninism is not as mysterious or obscure as 
 the Government attempts to make it sound 
 All sciences even the law have their own terminology but like a doctor ’s prescription this 
 does not mean they are dishonest or misleading to the general public   Not a single act of 
 violence is alleged against any one of us   Not are there charges that I know of thus far that 
 any of us collectively or individually advocated the forceful overthrow of the United States 
 Government 
  
  
 
                                                      5 
 This science of Marxism Leninism which is expounded in the books as evidence had its origin 
 over a century ago with two great political thinkers Karl Marx and Frederick Engels   In a few 
 words and there is always a danger of over simplification of a scientific subject they 
 declared that what happens to humanity is not a matter of blind fate nor the will of great men 
 nor must it be accepted as irrevocable   They said mankind can find a scientific explanation for 
 wars famine economic depression and poverty and that mankind especially the working 
 class can help to change society can alter and direct the course of history can abolish these 
 evils and institute a planned social order based on the well being of all Out of their profound 
 analysis of all human history and especially of its present stage known as capitalism they 
 developed the system of scientific socialism which you will hear  
 Today it has become a tremendous subject too vast for any one person to fully explain nor 
 would the time allowed for a trial permit it   The Government I believe will try to do the 
 impossible to compress over a century of the development of a great social science into the 
 use of a few books and an infinitesimal part of its application 
 These scientific theories were not fixed and final at the death of Marx and Engels who never 
 considered them a dogma   Like all sciences they have expanded and have been modified by 
 subsequent developments 
 Other students and writers took up where they left off particularly V. I. Lenin a giant intellect 
 and a great man who suffered exile and imprisonment under the Russian Czar 
 He returned to his beloved country to lead the workers and peasants to free themselves form 
 Czarist tyranny and exploitation Lenin enriched especially his 
 analyses of new social conditions brought   of imperialism and the advent of 
 socialism 
 Marxist Leninist writings today fill thousands of books in all known languages and would more 
 than fill this courtroom from floor to ceiling   They are   people 
 throughout the world but we will prove to you that these great beacon lights are not 
 blueprints are not hard and fast directives but are only a guide modified to conform to the 
 developments of history and to new social conditions   Programs immediate programs are 
 their application 
 We hold that political theories are not triable in a court of law under our established American 
 tradition   No jury ’s verdict can decide their merit only the people can do that 
  
  
 
                                                      6 
 We have believed that under the Bill of Rights we have a right to advocate our views but 
 since our ideas are here on trial we feel we have a sacred duty to ourselves and to our Party 
 to adequately defend them from any slander or distortion 
 We contend that Americans have a right to speak their minds out on any subject We 
 Communists have a right to defend socialism or the evolution of the capitalist system and 
 economy and of the private ownership of the means of life of all the people 
 We will prove that such a change can and will be achieved only when the majority of the 
 American people are ready and willing to make it and that the Communist Party does not 
 advocate force and violence to effect such a change 
 We will try to prove to you during this trial the meaning of working class internationalism 
 which the Government will use to bolster up their theory of foreign agent 
 Abraham Lincoln said   The strongest bond of human sympathy outside the family relation 
 should be one uniting all working people of all nations and tongues and kindred Both May 
 Day and International Women ’s Day we will prove had their origin here in the United States 
 even though they are now celebrated internationally 
 In the spirit of such solidarity I will show that I made three trips abroad and which except for 
 visits to Canada were my first outside the U.S.A.   The occasions were a Congress of Women 
 held in 1945 the 80th birthday of Marcel Cachin editor of the Communist daily paper of Paris 
 L’Humanite in 1949 and to cover the convention of the French Communist Party in 1950 
 where I was received as a fraternal delegate from our American party and invited to deliver its 
 greetings 
 On this last trip I visited London over a weekend spoke at a London District Communist Party 
 conference and visited the grave of Karl Marx 
 You will undoubtedly hear evidence form the Government of my first trip to Europe The 
 International Congress of Women was held in 1945 before the ashes of war were cold 
 Women participated from all the Allied countries   The Soviet Union England France Italy 
 Hungary and others 
 
  
  
 
                                                      7 
 Many had just been released form concentration camps and prisons   Ravensbrouck 
 Buchenwald Auschwitz   We met women there who had been in the Soviet Army air force 
 who had been in charge of railroads were executives of industry and reconstruction women 
 who came from a socialist country We met Spanish women in exile some who came out of 
 Spain at the risk of their lives 
 This Congress held in Paris without heat with flickering lights with sparse food supplies was 
 dedicated to the establishment of permanent peace in the world the welfare of children to 
 the rights of women all so ruthlessly    Never to let it happen again 
 was their burning resolve 
 Our American delegation was amazed that they were so fearful that fascism like the fabled 
 Phoenix would arise again from its own ashes On our home voyage via an Army transport 
 carrying over 5,000 returning G.I. ’s we found their desire for peace as eager as that of the 
 European women We will prove here that our work on behalf of peace is identical with the 
 hopes and dreams of men and women all over the world as well as the whole American people 
 today 
 I wrote a series of 28 articles on these trips   The one the Government has listed is I Met A 
 Great Leader of France published February 3 1946 in The Worker and referring to a 
 member and vice president of the French Assembly a leader of the French resistance 
 movement against the Nazis a French Communist leader Jacques Duclos   You have heard 
 his name from Mr. Lane   You will hear a great deal about this French Communist who had 
 written an article in a French Communists magazine Cahiers Du Communisme in April 1945  
 It was addressed to his French comrades 
 We will prove that they had reconstructed their party officially on its emergence from 
 underground and were determined not to lose its identity in the popular United Front which 
 had developed in the days of the resistance   While cooperating to the fullest for the 
 reestablishment of the French Republic they maintained their independent existence as the 
 Communist Party of France   We will prove that he used as an example of the wrong way to 
 work the dissolution of the American Communist Party and the creation of the Communist 
 Political Association which he analyzed in detail for the clarification of his French readers to 
 counteract certain suggestions for liquidation which had been circulated there in France  
 But we will prove that his article while it was a sharp criticism of the American party was not 
 a directive nor an order 
  
  
 
                                                      8 
 It stands to reason that such a characterization of our course as notorious revisionism which 
 came from an heroic fighter against Nazism and a Communist of world renown caused us to 
 give it our most serious attention especially was this so and we will prove when it coincided 
 with alarming developments within our own country which convinced us that the capitalist 
 leopard had not changed its spots during the war but was ready to resume class hostilities 
 against American labor unions and our Party 
 We will prove to you that a revaluation of our thinking and actions had already begun in our 
 party leadership and even without the Duclon article although possibly not quite so swiftly 
 we would have reconstituted our Party which had existed since 1919 interrupted only by an 
 extremely short period of the few months of the Communist Political Association 
 We feel that we have a right to call upon the Government to explain in the course of their 
 accusations why if the alleged danger emanating from our work was so clear and present that 
 the Smith Act was needed in 1940 why was n’t it used against our leadership until 1948 or 
 against us the present defendants until eleven years after the passage   We will prove that 
 Socialism was not on the agenda of the 1940 American political campaign nor in 1944 nor 
 1948 or even now in 1952 and therefore can not be the real causative factor for this 
 indictment 
 We have publicly advocated Socialism as our ultimate goal since the birth of our Party 33 
 years ago please remember 
 Nor is the charge of force and violence a newly discovered issue   It was fought out 
  for 16 years in the famous Schneiderman case which began 
 in 1927 and which they lost before the Supreme Court in 1943 
                                                                         
 three years after the Smith Act was passed   It was an attempt to cancel the citizenship of a 
 leading Communist 
 If our Party needed reassurance of its legal rights we felt it was certainly given by this 
 decision   Justice Murphy wrote the opinion   I will quote to you a portion of it which to out 
 Party and to the country generally was understood to have laid low this false accusation of 
 force and violence once and for all and to have reaffirmed our right to advocate our political 
 views This also casts light on our intent which you must consider   The Supreme Court had 
 before them four of the books produced here the quote is as follows 
  
  
 
                                                      9 
 A tenable conclusion from the foregoing is that the Party in 1927 desired to achieve its 
  democratic means and as a theoretical matter justified the 
 use of force and violence only as a method of preventing an attempted forcible 
 counter overthrow once the Party had obtained control in a peaceful manner or as a 
 method of last resort to enforce the majority will if at some indefinite future time 
 because of peculiar circumstances constitutional or peaceful channels were no longer 
 open 
 That is the close of Justice Murphy ’s quote   We will prove that our Party has repeatedly 
 endorsed this statement as a basically correct though incomplete statement of our Party ’s 
 policy in the matter of force and violence and William Z. Foster our chairman so stated a 
 few years ago before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
 It is our contention that neither of these issues neither Socialism nor the charge of force and 
 violence should rightfully bring us before this jury on this indictment   They becloud the real 
 issues which we believe are to be found primarily in our day to day activities which are not 
 peripheral or fringe activities as the Government contends but the heart of our work   To fight 
 against fascist tendencies in our country and to fight for peace is to us Marxism and Leninism 
 in action 
 We believe that the struggle for peace and democratic rights will very soon lead to a new 
 political alignment in our country which we believe will break through the pattern of the two- 
 party system and establish a new people ’s party a coalition which we would support 
 We will prove that what is called capitalism has existed only a comparatively short time in the 
 United States less than two centuries and it is not identical with government   It is neither 
 the first nor the last stage of human society   Only those who   it the Alpha 
 and Omega the best of all possible conclusions 
 Before capitalism there was feudalism when the feudal lords owned the land and lived on the 
 labor of their serf 
 Before that there were chattel slavery barbarism 
 Capitalism developed and supplanted feudalism   With the advent of power operated mass 
 production machinery it expanded rapidly -smaller group as free 
 competition was replaced by monopoly  
  
  
 
                                                      0 
 When we speak of abolishing capitalism we do not mean of course to abolish the rich natural 
 resources of our country nor the vast productive industries which have been developed by the 
 labor of its people   We will prove that we mean abolishing the private ownership of the basic 
 means of production and the profit making system it engenders which permits a few the 
 capitalistic class to exploit the many 
 We mean that the natural resources and the mines mills factories railroads means of 
 communication shall be owned in   people as state property to be 
  representing the working class as well as all other people 
 We do n’t mean that personal or private property is abolished in those things which are the 
 result of saving or for personal use What will be abolished is the use of private property to 
 exploit the labor of another   For example in a socialistic society the principle applied would 
 be from each according to his ability to each according to this work which is identical with 
 what St. Paul said to the Thessalonians that if any would not work neither should he eat 
 In a Communist society as differentiated from a socialistic society when an abundance of 
 everything needed for human life development and comfort is assured the principle would 
 then be from each according to his ability to each according to his needs 
 This will be Communism the fulfillment we believe of an ideal human society which we 
 believe to be possible and desirable 
 In answer as to how we expect socialism will be brought about in contradiction to the theory 
 of force and violence we will prove as I have said it can not be the result of our efforts alone 
 but it can be the result of the action of the majority of the people of the United States when 
 they are ready and willing to make such a change 
 We will show that we sincerely denounce in our constitution any group or party which 
 conspires or acts to subvert undermine weaken or overthrow any or all institutions of 
 American democracy through which the majority of the American people can maintain their 
 rights to determine their destinies 
 In relation to a future hypothetical situation in the United States where an entrenched 
 capitalist minority might use force to thwart the will of the people who voted for and are ready 
 to make the transition to socialism this would be tyranny and we would take the position 
 that the people would be justified to use force to overthrow it just like our own Government 
 called upon the people of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy to overthrow the rule of terror 
  
  
 
                                                      1 
 against the people and aid the underground resistance movement in all fascist occupied 
 countries The Communist position is that those who favored slavocracy opposed the abolition 
 of human slavery in the past it is quite possible that a diehard capitalist minority might 
 oppose the abolition of the capitalist profit system in the future 
 Here as in England and elsewhere we Communist strive for a peaceful road to Socialism We 
 will show that we would do everything in our power to prevent the use of force and violence in 
 establishing Socialism which we know full well can not be undertaken here or elsewhere 
 unless it has the support of the majority of the people   But we can not of course guarantee 
 that the enemies of the people will accept the decision of the people to move to Socialism 
 Socialism however is not yet on the order of the day let me repeat in the United States  
 The immediate political program of our Party we will prove is anti war and anti fascist for a 
 people ’s front government a government dedicated to assure the well being of the people  
 What will take place after that along the road to Socialism in the United States of America is 
 something history and the American people will determine but which no one can here 
 blueprint   This brings me now to my concluding remarks 
 We are here before you as defendants in the Smith Act case   We will prove to you that we are 
 not conspirators but that we are animated and   and aspirations with 
 courage to affirm our beliefs faith in the people and the future and a willingness to sacrifice 
 for a better world which we are confident is in birth   Nevertheless it is incumbent on the 
 Government regardless of our ideological unity to deal with us as individuals and not to 
 lump us together as a conspiracy because of the identity of our political views   We will try to 
 bring you a true and accurate picture of who we are what our lives have been what we say 
 and mean what we   day and the relation of all this immediate activity to our 
 ultimate aims 
 We will try to present to you during this trial our theories and work our program and our 
 ultimate goal the unity of theory and practice as it says in the books   We will not do this in a 
 classroom atmosphere but so that you can understand us in terms of our own knowledge 
 and experience regardless of whether you agree with us   We expect to convince you that we 
 are within our established constitutional rights to advocate change and progress to advocate 
 Socialism which we are convinced will guarantee to all our people in our great and beautiful 
 country the rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness   Whether we are right is no 
 issue here and no jury in this or any other trial but time alone will decide   Let none of us 
 forget especially in this trial in dealing with new ideas and proposals for social change the 
 wise words of Abraham Lincoln This country with its institutions belongs to the people who 
 inhabit it 
  
  
 
                                                      2 
 We are asking you to decide this case on the evidence or more correctly may I say on the 
 lack of evidence which we are confident will be glaringly revealed long before this trial is over 
 to decide this case on the exact issues regardless of fear or favor or the hysteria or prejudice 
 which we all know very well does exist among some groups in the community   We ask you to 
 keep your minds open until all the evidence including our own is before you   Then you will 
 be shown that we do not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States by 
 force and violence

63,Gerald R. Ford,Address Upon Taking the Oath of the U.S. Presidency,1974," 
 
 
 Mr. Chief Justice my dear friends my fellow Americans  
 The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was   and by 
 every President under the Constitution But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary 
 circumstances never before  is an hour of history that troubles 
 our minds and hurts our hearts 
 Therefore I feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen 
 Not an inaugural address not a fireside chat not a campaign speech just a little straight 
 talk among friends And I intend it to be the first of many 
 I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your and so I 
 ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers And I hope that such prayers will 
 also be the first of many If you have not chosen neither have I gained 
  promises I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice 
 Presidency I have not subscribed to any partisan platform I am indebted to no man and only 
 to one woman my dear wife as I begin this very difficult job 
  
  
 
                         
          
          
                               
 I have not sought this enormous responsibility but I will not shirk it Those who nominated 
 and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends They were of both 
 parties   people and acting under the Constitution in their name It is only 
 fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the 
 people 
 Thomas Jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty 
 And down the years Abraham Lincoln renewed this American article of faith asking Is there 
 any better way or equal hope in the world  
 I intend on Monday next to request of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the 
 President pro tempore of the Senate the privilege of appearing before the Congress to share 
 with my former colleagues and with you the American people my views on the priority 
 business of the Nation and to solicit your views and their views And may I say to the Speaker 
 and the others if I could meet with you right after these remarks I would appreciate it 
 Even though this is late in an election year there is no way we can go forward except 
 together and no way anybody can win   people 's urgent needs We 
 can not stand still or slip backwards We must go forward now together 
 To the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations and I hope that could encompass 
 the whole world I pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace America will remain 
 strong and united but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire 
 family of man as well as to our own precious freedom I believe that truth is the glue that 
 holds government together not only our Government but civilization itself That bond though 
 stained is unbroken at home and abroad 
 In all my public and private acts as your President I expect to follow my instincts of openness 
 and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end 
 My fellow Americans our long national nightmare is over  
 Our Constitution works Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men Here the 
 people rule But there is a higher  we honor Him who ordains not 
 only righteousness but love not only justice but mercy As we bind up the internal wounds of 
 Watergate more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars let us restore the 
 golden rule to our political process and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of 
 hate 
  
  
 
                         
          
          
                               
 In the beginning I asked you to pray for me Before closing I ask again your prayers for 
 Richard Nixon and for his family May our former President who brought peace to millions 
 find it for himself May God bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters whose love 
 and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the White 
 House I can only guess at those burdens although I have witnessed at close hand the 
 tragedies that befell three Presidents and the lesser trials of others 
 With all the strength and all the good sense I have gained from life with all the confidence of 
 my family my friends and my dedicated staff impart to me and with the good will of 
 countless Americans I have encountered in recent visits to 40 States I now solemnly reaffirm 
 my promise I made to you last December 6 To uphold the Constitution to do what is right as 
 God gives me to see the right and to do the very best I can for America 
 God helping me I will not let you down 
 Thank you",0.0340039804577827,0.0153449960052967,0.6643806099891663,0.0174715518951416,0.1240483671426773,0.1346409022808075,0.010109631344676,0.2360060690943044,0.5121770930594461,59.379079384871176,0.4382470119521912,0.015182186234817813,0.13648293963254593,0.12148481439820022,22.976744186046513,1.0
64,Edward M. Kennedy,Faith Truth and Tolerance in America,1983," 
 
 
 Thank you very much Professor Kombay for that generous introduction And let me say that I 
 never expected to hear such kind words from Dr. Falwell So in return I have an invitation of 
 my own On January 20th 1985 I hope Dr. Falwell will say a prayer at the inauguration of the 
 next Democratic President of the United States Now Dr. Falwell I ’m not exactly sure how 
 you feel about that You might not appreciate the President but the Democrats certainly 
 would appreciate the prayer 
 Actually a number of people in Washington were surprised that I was invited to speak here 
 and even more surprised when I accepted the invitation They seem to think that it ’s easier 
 for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a Kennedy to come to the campus 
 of Liberty Baptist College In honor of our meeting I have asked Dr. Falwell as your 
 Chancellor to permit all the students an extra hour next Saturday night before curfew And in 
 return I have promised to watch the Old Time Gospel Hour next Sunday morning 
 I realize that my visit may be a little controversial But as many of you have heard Dr. Falwell 
 recently sent me a membership in the Moral Majority and I did n't even apply for it And I 
 wonder if that means that I 'm a member in good standing  
  
  
 
                                           
 Rev. Falwell Somewhat 
 Senator Kennedy Somewhat he says  
 This is of course a nonpolitical speech which is probably best under the circumstances Since 
 I am not a candidate for President it would certainly be inappropriate to ask for your support 
 in this election and probably inaccurate to thank you for it in the last one 
 I have come here to discuss my beliefs about faith and country tolerance and truth in 
 America I know we begin with certain disagreements and I strongly suspect that at the end 
 of the evening some of our disagreements will remain But I also hope that tonight and in the 
 months and years ahead we will always respect the right of others to differ that we will 
 never lose sight of our own fallibility and that we will view ourselves with a sense of 
 perspective and a sense of humor After all in the New Testament even the Disciples had to 
 be taught to look first to the beam in their own eyes and only then to the mote in their 
 neighbor ’s eyes 
 I am mindful of that counsel I am an American and a Catholic I love my country and 
 treasure my faith But I do not assume that my conception of patriotism or policy is invariably 
 correct or that my convictions about religion should command any greater respect than any 
 other faith in this pluralistic society I believe there surely is such a thing as truth but who 
 among us can claim a monopoly on it 
 There are those who do and their own words testify to their intolerance For example 
 because the Moral Majority has worked with members of different denominations one 
 fundamentalist group has denounced Dr. Falwell for hastening the ecumenical church and for 
 yoking together with Roman Catholics Mormons and others I am relieved that Dr. Falwell 
 does not regard that as a sin and on this issue he himself has become the target of narrow 
 prejudice When people agree on public policy they ought to be able to work together even 
 while they worship in diverse ways For truly we are all yoked together as Americans and the 
 yoke is the happy one of individual freedom and mutual respect 
 But in saying that we can not and should not turn aside from a deeper and more pressing 
 question which is whether and how religion should influence government A generation ago 
 a presidential candidate had to prove his independence of undue religious influence in public 
 life and he had to do so partly at the insistence of evangelical Protestants John Kennedy said 
 at that time I believe in an America where there is no religious bloc voting of any kind Only 
 twenty years later another candidate was appealing to a[n evangelical meeting as a religious 
  
  
 
                                           
 bloc Ronald Reagan said to 15 thousand evangelicals at the Roundtable in Dallas I know 
 that you ca n’t endorse me I want you to know I endorse you and what you are doing 
 To many Americans that pledge was a sign and a symbol of a dangerous breakdown in the 
 separation of church and state Yet this principle as vital as it is is not a simplistic and rigid 
 command Separation of church and state can not mean an absolute separation between moral 
 principles and political power The challenge today is to recall the origin of the principle to 
 define its purpose and refine its application to the politics of the present 
 The founders of our nation had long and bitter experience with the state as both the agent 
 and the adversary of particular religious views In colonial Maryland Catholics paid a double 
 land tax and in Pennsylvania they had to list their names on a public roll an ominous 
 precursor of the first Nazi laws against the Jews And Jews in turn faced discrimination in all of 
 the thirteen original Colonies Massachusetts exiled Roger Williams and his congregation for 
 contending that civil government had no right to enforce the Ten Commandments Virginia 
 harassed Baptist teachers and also established a religious test for public service writing into 
 the law that no popish followers could hold any office 
 But during the Revolution Catholics Jews and Non Conformists all rallied to the cause and 
 fought valiantly for the American commonwealth for John Winthrop ’s city upon a hill 
 Afterwards when the Constitution was ratified and then amended the framers gave freedom 
 for all religion and from any established religion the very first place in the Bill of Rights 
 Indeed the framers themselves professed very different faiths Washington was an 
 Episcopalian Jefferson a deist and Adams a Calvinist And although he had earlier opposed 
 toleration John Adams later contributed to the building of Catholic churches and so did 
 George Washington Thomas Jefferson said his proudest achievement was not the presidency 
 or the writing the Declaration of Independence but drafting the Virginia Statute of Religious 
 Freedom He stated the vision of the first Americans and the First Amendment very clearly 
 The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time 
 The separation of church and state can sometimes be frustrating for women and men of 
 religious faith They may be tempted to misuse government in order to impose a value which 
 they can not persuade others to accept But once we succumb to that temptation we step onto 
 a slippery slope where everyone ’s freedom is at risk Those who favor censorship should recall 
 that one of the first books ever burned was the first English translation of the Bible As 
 President Eisenhower warned in 1953 Do n’t join the book burners the right to say ideas 
 the right to record them and the right to have them accessible to others is unquestioned or 
  
  
 
                                           
 this is n’t America And if that right is denied at some future day the torch can be turned 
 against any other book or any other belief Let us never forget Today ’s Moral Majority could 
 become tomorrow ’s persecuted minority 
 The danger is as great now as when the founders of the nation first saw it In 1789 their fear 
 was of factional strife among dozens of denominations Today there are hundreds and 
 perhaps even thousands of faiths and millions of Americans who are outside any fold 
 Pluralism obviously does not and can not mean that all of them are right but it does mean 
 that there are areas where government can not and should not decide what is wrong to 
 believe to think to read and to do As Professor Larry Tribe one of the nation ’s leading 
 constitutional scholars has written Law in a non theocratic state can not measure religious 
 truth nor can the state impose it 
 The real transgression occurs when religion wants government to tell citizens how to live 
 uniquely personal parts of their lives The failure of Prohibition proves the futility of such an 
 attempt when a majority or even a substantial minority happens to disagree Some questions 
 may be inherently individual ones or people may be sharply divided about whether they are 
 In such cases like Prohibition and abortion the proper role of religion is to appeal to the 
 conscience of the individual not the coercive power of the state  
 But there are other questions which are inherently public in nature which we must decide 
 together as a nation and where religion and religious values can and should speak to our 
 common conscience The issue of nuclear war is a compelling example It is a moral issue it 
 will be  to give any effect to the moral 
 values of their creed people of faith must speak directly about public policy The Catholic 
 bishops and the Reverend Billy Graham have every right to stand for the nuclear freeze and 
 Dr. Falwell has every right to stand against it 
 There must be standards for the exercise of such leadership so that the obligations of belief 
 will not be debased into an opportunity for mere political advantage But to take a stand at all 
 when a question is both properly public and truly moral is to stand in a long and honored 
 tradition Many of the great evangelists of the 1800s were in the forefront of the abolitionist 
 movement In our own time the Reverend William Sloane Coffin challenged the morality of 
 the war in Vietnam Pope John XXIII renewed the Gospel ’s call to social justice And Dr. Martin 
 Luther King Jr. who was the greatest prophet of this century awakened our nation and its 
 conscience to the evil of racial segregation  
  
  
 
                                           
 Their words have blessed our world And who now wishes they had been silent Who would 
 bid Pope John Paul II to quiet his voice against the oppression in Eastern Europe the 
 violence in Central America or the crying needs of the landless the hungry and those who 
 are tortured in so many of the dark political prisons of our time 
 President Kennedy who said that no religious body should seek to impose its will also 
 urged religious leaders to state their views and give their commitment when the public debate 
 involved ethical issues In drawing the line between imposed will and essential witness we 
 keep church and state separate and at the same time we recognize that the City of God 
 should speak to the civic duties of men and women 
 There are four tests which draw that line and define the difference 
 First we must respect the integrity of religion itself 
 People of conscience should be careful how they deal in the word of their Lord In our own 
 history religion has been falsely invoked to sanction prejudice even slavery to condemn 
 labor unions and public spending for the poor I believe that the prophecy The poor you 
 always have with you is an indictment not a commandment And I respectfully suggest that 
 God has taken no position on the Department of Education and that a balanced budget 
 constitutional amendment is a matter of economic analysis and not heavenly appeals 
 Religious values can not be excluded from every public issue but not every public issue 
 involves religious values And how ironic it is when those very values are denied in the name 
 of religion For example we are sometimes told that it is wrong to feed the hungry but that 
 mission is an explicit mandate given to us in the 25th chapter of Matthew 
 Second we must respect the independent judgments of conscience 
 Those who proclaim moral and religious values can offer counsel but they should not casually 
 treat a position on a public issue as a test of fealty to faith Just as I disagree with the Catholic 
 bishops on tuition tax credits which I oppose so other Catholics can and do disagree with 
 the hierarchy on the basis of honest conviction on the question of the nuclear freeze 
 Thus the controversy about the Moral Majority arises not only from its views but from its 
 name which in the minds of many seems to imply that only one set of public policies is 
 moral and only one majority can possibly be right Similarly people are and should be 
 perplexed when the religious lobbying group Christian Voice publishes a morality index of 
  
  
 
                                           
 congressional voting records which judges the morality of   toward 
 Zimbabwe and Taiwan 
 Let me offer another illustration Dr. Falwell has written and I quote To stand against 
 Israel is to stand against God Now there is no one in the Senate who has stood more firmly 
 for Israel than I have Yet I do not doubt the faith of those on the other side Their error is 
 not one of religion but of policy And I hope to be able to persuade them that that they are 
 wrong in terms of both America ’s interest and the justice of Israel ’s cause 
 Respect for conscience is most in jeopardy and the harmony of our diverse society is most at 
 risk when we re establish directly or indirectly a religious test for public office That relic of 
 the colonial era which is specifically prohibited in the Constitution has reappeared in recent 
 years After the last election the Reverend James Robison Robison warned President 
 Reagan no to surround himself as president before him had with the counsel of the 
 ungodly 
 I utterly reject any such standard for any position anywhere in public service Two centuries 
 ago the victims were Catholics and Jews In the 1980s the victims could be atheists in some 
 other day or decade they could be the members of the Thomas Road Baptist Church Indeed 
 in 1976 I regarded it as unworthy and un American when some people said or hinted that 
 Jimmy Carter should not be president because he was a born again Christian We must never 
 judge the fitness of individuals to govern on the bas[is of where they worship whether they 
 follow Christ or Moses whether they are called born again or ungodly Where it is right to 
 apply moral values to public life let all of us avoid the temptation to be self righteous and 
 absolutely certain of ourselves And if that temptation ever comes let us recall Winston 
 Churchill ’s humbling description of an intolerant and inflexible colleague There but for the 
 grace of God goes God 
 Third in applying religious values we must respect the integrity of public debate 
 In that debate faith is no substitute for facts Critics may oppose the nuclear freeze for what 
 they regard as moral reasons They have every right to argue that any negotiation with the 
 Soviets is wrong or that any accommodation with them sanctions their crimes or that no 
 agreement can be good enough and therefore all agreements only increase the chance of war 
 I do not believe that but it surely does not violate the standard of fair public debate to say it 
 What does violate that standard what the opponents of the nuclear freeze have no right to 
 do is to assume that they are infallible and so any argument against the freeze will do 
 whether it is false or true 
  
  
 
                                           
 The nuclear freeze proposal is not unilateral but bilateral with equal restraints on the 
 United States and the Soviet Union The nuclear freeze does not require that we trust the 
 Russians but demands full and effective verification The nuclear freeze does not concede a 
 Soviet lead in nuclear weapons but recognizes that human beings in each great power 
 already have in their fallible hands the overwhelming capacity to remake into a pile of 
 radioactive rubble the earth which God has made  
 There is no morality There is no morality in the mushroom cloud The black rain of nuclear 
 ashes will fall alike on the just and the unjust And then it will be too late to wish that we had 
 done the real work of this atomic age which is to seek a world that is neither red nor dead 
 I am perfectly prepared to debate the nuclear freeze on policy grounds or moral ones But we 
 should not be forced to discuss phantom issues or false charges They only deflect us form the 
 urgent task of deciding how best to prevent a planet divided from becoming a planet 
 destroyed 
 And it does not advance the debate to contend that the arms race is more divine punishment 
 than human problem or that in any event the final days are near As Pope John said two 
 decades ago at the opening of the Second Vatican Council We must beware of those who 
 burn with zeal but are not endowed with much sense we must disagree with the prophets 
 of doom who are always forecasting disasters as though the end of the earth was at hand 
 The message which echoes across the years is very clear The earth is still here and if we 
 wish to keep it a prophecy of doom is no alternative to a policy of arms control 
 Fourth and finally we must respect the motives of those who exercise their right to disagree 
 We sorely test our ability to live together if we readily question each other ’s integrity It may 
 be harder to restrain our feelings when moral principles are at stake for they go to the 
 deepest wellsprings of our being But the more our feelings diverge the more deeply felt they 
 are the greater is our obligation to grant the sincerity and essential decency of our fellow 
 citizens on the other side 
 Those who favor E.R.A Equal Rights Amendment are not antifamily or blasphemers And 
 their purpose is not an attack on the Bible Rather we believe this is the best way to fix in 
 our national firmament the ideal that not only all men but all people are created equal 
 Indeed my mother who strongly favors E.R.A. would be surprised to hear that she is anti- 
 family For my part I think of the amendment ’s opponents as wrong on the issue but not as 
 lacking in moral character 
  
  
 
                                           
 I could multiply the instances of name calling sometimes on both sides Dr. Falwell is not a 
 warmonger And liberal clergymen are not as the Moral Majority suggested in a recent 
 letter equivalent to Soviet sympathizers The critics of official prayer in public schools are 
 not Pharisees many of them are both civil libertarians and believers who think that families 
 should pray more at home with their children and attend church and synagogue more 
 faithfully And people are not sexist because they stand against abortion and they are not 
 murderers because they believe in free choice Nor does it help anyone Nor does it help 
 anyone ’s cause to shout such epithets or to try and shout a speaker down which is what 
 happened last April when Dr. Falwell was hissed and heckled at Harvard So I am doubly 
 grateful for your courtesy here this evening That was not Harvard ’s finest hour but I am 
 happy to say that the loudest applause from the Harvard audience came in defense of Dr. 
 Falwell ’s right to speak 
 In short I hope for an America where neither fundamentalist nor humanist will be a dirty 
 word but a fair description of the different ways in which people of goodwill look at life and 
 into their own souls 
 I hope for an America where no president no public official no individual will ever be deemed 
 a greater or lesser American because of religious doubt or religious belief 
 I hope for an America where the power of faith will always burn brightly but where no 
 modern Inquisition of any kind will ever light the fires of fear coercion or angry division 
 I hope for an America where we can all contend freely and vigorously but where we will 
 treasure and guard those standards of civility which alone make this nation safe for both 
 democracy and diversity 
 Twenty years ago this fall in New York City President Kennedy met for the last time with a 
 Protestant assembly The atmosphere had been transformed since his earlier address during 
 the 1960 campaign to the Houston Ministerial Association He had spoken there to allay 
 suspicions about his Catholicism and to answer those who claimed that on the day of his 
 baptism he was somehow disqualified from becoming President His speech in Houston and 
 then his election drove that prejudice from the center of our national life Now three years 
 later in November of 1963 he was appearing before the Protestant Council of New York City 
 to reaffirm what he regarded as some fundamental truths On that occasion John Kennedy 
 said The family of man is not limited to a single race or religion to a single city or 
 country the family of man is nearly 3 billion strong Most of its members are not white and 
 most of them are not Christian And as President Kennedy reflected on that reality he 
  
  
 
                                           
 restated an ideal for which he had lived his life that the members of this family should be 
 at peace with one another 
 That ideal shines across all the generations of our history and all the ages of our faith 
 carrying with it the most ancient dream For as the Apostle Paul wrote long ago in Romans If 
 it be possible as much as it lieth in you live peaceably with all men 
 I believe it is possible the choice lies within us as fellow citizens let us live peaceable with

65,Eleanor Roosevelt,The Struggle for Human Rights,1948," 
 
 
 I have come this evening to talk with you on one of the greatest issues of our time that is 
 the preservation of human freedom I have chosen to discuss it here in France at the 
 Sorbonne because here in this soil the roots of human freedom have long ago struck deep 
 and here they have been richly nourished It was here the Declaration of the Rights of Man 
 was proclaimed and the great slogans of the French Revolution liberty equality fraternity 
 fired the imagination of men I have chosen to discuss this issue in Europe because this has 
 been the scene of the greatest historic battles between freedom and tyranny I have chosen to 
 discuss it in the early days of the General Assembly because the issue of human liberty is 
 decisive for the settlement of outstanding political differences and for the future of the United 
 Nations 
 The decisive importance of this issue was fully   of the United 
 Nations at San Francisco Concern for the preservation and promotion of human rights and 
 fundamental freedoms stands at the heart of the United Nations Its Charter is distinguished 
 by its preoccupation with the rights and welfare of individual men and women The United 
 Nations has made it clear that it intends to uphold human rights and to protect the dignity of 
 the human personality 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 In the preamble to the Charter the keynote is set when it declares We the people of the 
 United Nations determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and 
 worth of the human person in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and 
 small and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom This 
 reflects the basic premise of the Charter that the peace and security of mankind are 
 dependent on mutual respect for the rights and freedoms of all 
 One of the purposes of the United Nations is declared in article 1 to be to achieve 
 international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic social cultural or 
 humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for 
 fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion 
 This thought is repeated at several points and notably in articles 55 and 56 the Members 
 pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the United Nations for 
 the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental 
 freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion 
 The Human Rights Commission was given as its first and most important task the preparation 
 of an International Bill of Rights The General Assembly which opened its third session here in 
 Paris a few days ago will have before it the first fruit of the Commission 's labors in this task 
 that is the International Declaration of Human Rights 
 The Declaration was finally completed after much work during the last session of the Human 
 Rights Commission in New York in the spring of 1948 The Economic and Social Council has 
 sent it without recommendation to the General Assembly together with other documents 
  Rights Commission 
 It was decided in our Commission that a Bill of Rights should contain two parts 
 1 A Declaration which could be approved through action of the Member States of the United 
 Nations in the General Assembly This declaration would have great moral force and would 
 say to the peoples of the world this is what we hope human rights may mean to all people in 
 the years to come We have put down here the rights that we consider basic for individual 
 human beings the world over to have Without them we feel that the full development of 
 individual personality is impossible 
 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 2 The second part of the bill which the Human Rights Commission has not yet completed 
 because of the lack of time is a covenant which would be in the form of a treaty to be 
 presented to the nations of the world Each nation as it is prepared to do so would ratify this 
 covenant and the covenant would then become binding on the nations which adhere to it 
 Each nation ratifying would then be obligated to change its laws wherever they did not 
 conform to the points contained in the covenant 
 This covenant of course would have to be a simpler document It could not state aspirations 
 which we feel to be permissible in the Declaration It could only state rights which could be 
  it must contain methods of implementation and no state ratifying the 
 covenant could be allowed to disregard it The methods of implementation have not yet been 
 agreed upon nor have they been given adequate   at any of 
 its meetings There certainly should be discussion on the entire question of this world Bill of 
 Human Rights and there may be   of the Declaration if they come 
 to agreement on it The acceptance of the Declaration I think should encourage every nation 
 in the coming months to discuss its meaning with its people so that they will be better 
 prepared to accept the covenant with a deeper understanding of the problems involved when 
 that is presented we hope a year from now and we hope accepted 
 The Declaration has come from the Human Rights Commission with unanimous acceptance 
 except for four abstentions the U.S.S.R. Yugoslavia Ukraine and Byelorussia The reason 
 for this is a fundamental difference in the conception of human rights as they exist in these 
 states and in certain other Member States in the United Nations 
 In the discussion before the Assembly I think it should be made crystal clear what these 
 differences are and tonight I want to spend a little time making them clear to you It seems to 
 me there is a valid reason for taking the time today to think carefully and clearly on the 
 subject of human rights because in the acceptance and observance of these rights lies the 
 root I believe of our chance of peace in the future and for the strengthening of the United 
 Nations organization to the point where it can maintain peace in the future 
 We must not be confused about what freedom is Basic human rights are simple and easily 
 understood freedom of speech and a free press freedom of religion and worship freedom of 
 assembly and the right of petition the right of men to be secure in their homes and free from 
 unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary arrest and punishment 
 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 We must not be   of the forces of reaction to prostitute the great words 
 of our free tradition and thereby to confuse the struggle Democracy freedom human rights 
 have come to have a definite meaning to the people of the world which we must not allow any 
 nation to so change that they are made synonymous with suppression and dictatorship 
 There are basic differences that show up even in the use of words between a democratic and a 
 totalitarian country For instance democracy means one thing to the U.S.S.R. and another 
 the U.S.A. and I know in France I have served since the first meeting of the nuclear 
 commission on the Human Rights Commission and I think this point stands out clearly 
 The U.S.S.R. Representatives assert that they already have achieved many things which we 
 in what they call the bourgeois democracies can not achieve because their government 
 controls the accomplishment of these things Our government seems powerless to them 
 because in the last analysis it is   They would not put it that way 
 they would say that the people in the U.S.S.R. control their  
 government to have certain absolute rights We on the other hand feel that certain rights 
 can never be granted to the government but must be kept in the hands of the people 
 For instance the U.S.S.R. will assert that their press is free because the state makes it free by 
 providing the machinery the paper and even the money for salaries for the people who work 
 on the paper They state that there is no control over what is printed in the various papers 
 that they subsidize in this manner such for instance as a trade union paper But what would 
 happen if a paper were to print ideas which were critical of the basic policies and beliefs of the 
 Communist government I am sure some good reason would be found for abolishing the 
 paper 
 It is true that they have been many cases where newspapers in the U.S.S.R. have criticized 
 officials and their actions and have been responsible for the removal of those officials but in 
 doing so they did not criticize anything which was fundamental to Communist beliefs They 
 simply criticized methods of doing things so one must differentiate between things which are 
 permissible such as criticism of any individual or of the manner of doing things and the 
 criticism of a belief which would be considered vital to the acceptance of Communism 
 What are the differences for instance between trade unions in the totalitarian states and in 
 the democracies In the totalitarian state a trade union is an instrument used by the 
 government to enforce duties not to assert rights Propaganda material which the 
 government desires the workers to have is -unions to be circulated to 
 their members 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 Our trade unions on the other hand are solely the instrument of the workers themselves 
 They represent the workers in their relations with the government and with management and 
 they are free to develop their own opinions without government help or interference The 
 concepts of our trade unions and those in totalitarian countries are drastically different There 
 is little mutual understanding 
 I think the best example one can give of this basic difference of the use of terms is the right 
 to work The Soviet Union insists that this is a basic right which it alone can guarantee 
 because it alone provides full   But the right to work in the 
 Soviet Union means the assignment of workers to do whatever task is given to them by the 
 government without an opportunity for the people to participate in the decision that the 
 government should do this A society in which everyone works is not necessarily a free society 
 and may indeed be a slave society on the other hand a society in which there is widespread 
 economic insecurity can turn freedom into a barren and vapid right for millions of people 
 We in the United States have come to realize it means freedom to choose one ’s job to work 
 or not to work as one desires We in the United States have come to realize however that 
 people have a right to demand that their government will not allow them to starve because as 
 individuals they can not find work of the kind they are accustomed to doing and this is a 
 decision brought   which came as a result of the great depression in 
 which many people were out of work but we would not consider in the United States that we 
 had gained any freedom if we were compelled to follow a dictatorial assignment to work where 
 and when we were told The right of choice would seem to us an important fundamental 
 freedom 
 I have great sympathy with the Russian people They love their country and have always 
 defended it valiantly against invaders They have been through a period of revolution as a 
 result of which they were for a time cut off from outside contact 
 They have not lost their resulting suspicion of other countries and the great difficulty is today 
 that their government encourages this suspicion and seems to believe that force alone will 
 bring them respect 
 We in the democracies believe in a kind of international respect and action which is 
 reciprocal We do not think others should treat us differently from the way they wish to be 
 treated It is interference in other countries that especially stirs up antagonism against the 
 Soviet Government If it wishes to feel secure in developing its economic and political theories 
 within its territory then it should grant to others that same security We believe in the 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 freedom of people to make their own mistakes We do not interfere with them and they should 
 not interfere with others 
 The basic problem confronting the world today as I said in the beginning is the preservation 
 of human freedom for the individual and consequently for the society of which he is a part We 
 are fighting this battle again today as it was fought at the time of the French Revolution and 
 as the time of the American Revolution The issue of human liberty is as decisive now as it 
 was then I want to give you my conception of what is meant in my   the 
 individual 
 Long ago in London during a discussion with Mr. Vyshinsky he told me there was no such 
 thing as freedom for the individual in the world All freedom of the individual was conditioned 
 by the rights of other individuals That of course I granted I said We approach the question 
 from a different point of view/ we here in the United Nations are trying to develop ideals which 
 will be broader in outlook which will consider first the rights of man which will consider what 
 makes man more free not governments but man 
 The totalitarian state typically places the will of the people second to decrees promulgated by 
 a few men at the top 
 
 Naturally there must always be consideration of the rights of others but in a democracy this 
 is not a restriction Indeed in our democracies we make our freedoms secure because each of 
 us is expected to respect the rights of others and we are free to make our own laws Freedom 
 for our peoples is not only a right but also a tool Freedom of speech freedom of the press 
 freedom of information freedom of assembly these are not just abstract ideals to us they 
 are tools with which we create a way of life a way of life in which we can enjoy freedom 
 Sometimes the processes of democracy are slow and I have known some of our leaders to 
 say that a benevolent dictatorship would accomplish the ends desired in a much shorter time 
 than it takes to go through the democratic processes of discussion and the slow formation of 
 public opinion But there is no way of insuring that a dictatorship will remain benevolent or 
 that power once in the hands of a few will be returned to the people without struggle or 
 revolution This we have   we accept the slow processes of 
 democracy because we know that shortcuts compromise principles on which no compromise is 
 possible 
 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 The final expression of the opinion of the people with us is through free and honest elections 
 with valid choices on basic issues and candidates The secret ballot is an essential to free 
 elections but you must have a choice before you I have heard my husband say many times 
 that a people need never lose their freedom if they kept their right to a secret ballot and if 
 they used that secret ballot to the full Basic decisions of our society are made through the 
 expressed will of the people That is why when we see these liberties threatened instead of 
 falling apart our nation becomes unified and our democracies come together as a unified 
 group in spite of our varied backgrounds and many racial strains 
 In the United States we have a capitalistic economy That is because public opinion favors that 
 type of economy under the conditions in which we live But we have imposed certain 
 restraints for instance we have antitrust laws These are the legal evidence of the 
 determination of the American people to maintain an economy of free competition and not to 
 allow monopolies to take away the people ’s freedom 
 Our trade unions grow stronger because the people come to believe that this is the proper 
 way to guarantee the rights of the workers and that the right to organize and to bargain 
 collectively keeps the balance between the actual producer an the investor of money and the 
 manage in industry who watches over the man who works with this hands and who produces 
 the materials which are out tangible wealth 
 In the United States we are old enough not to claim perfection We recognize that we have 
 some problems of discrimination but we find steady progress being made in the solution of 
 these problems Through normal democratic processes we are coming to understand our 
 needs and how we can attain full equality for all our people 
 Free discussion on the subject is permitted Our Supreme Court has recently rendered 
 decisions to clarify a number of our laws to guarantee the rights of all 
 The U.S.S.R. claims it has reached a point where all races within her borders are officially 
 considered equal and have equal rights and they insist that they have no discrimination where 
 minorities are concerned 
 This is a laudable objective but there are other aspects of the development of freedom for the 
 individual which are essential before the mere absence of discrimination is worth much and 
 these are lacking in the Soviet Union Unless they are being denied freedoms which they want 
 and which they see other people have people do not usually complain of discrimination It is 
 these other freedoms the basic freedoms of speech of the press of religion and conscience 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 of assembly of fair trial and freedom from arbitrary arrest and punishment which a 
 totalitarian government can not safely give its people and which give meaning to freedom from 
 discrimination 
 It is my belief and I am sure it is also yours that the struggle for democracy and freedom is 
 a critical struggle for their preservation is essential to the great objective of the United 
 Nations to maintain international peace and security Among free men the end can not justify 
 the means We know the patterns of totalitarianism the single political party the control of 
 schools press radio the arts the sciences and the church to support autocratic authority 
 these are the age old patterns against which men have struggled for three thousand years 
 These are the signs of reaction retreat and retrogression The United Nations must hold fast 
 to the heritage of freedom   of its people it must help us to pass it on to 
 generations to come 
 The development of the ideal of freedom and its translation into the everyday life of the 
 people in great areas of the earth is the product of the efforts of many peoples It is the fruit 
 of a long tradition of vigorous thinking and courageous action No one race and on one people 
 can claim to have done all the work to achieve greater dignity for human beings and great 
 freedom to develop human personality In each generation and in each country there must be 
 a continuation of the struggle and new steps forward must be taken since this is preeminently 
 a field in which to stand still is to retreat 
 The field of human rights is not one in which compromise on fundamental principles are 
 possible The work of the Commission on Human Rights is illustrative The Declaration of 
 Human Rights provides Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own The 
 Soviet Representative said he would agree to this right if a single phrase was added to it in 
 accordance with the procedure laid down in the laws of that country It is obvious that to 
 accept this would be not only to compromise but to nullify the right stated This case forcefully 
 illustrates the importance of the proposition that we must ever be alert not to compromise 
 fundamental human rights merely for the sake of reaching unanimity and thus lose them 
 As I see it it is not going to be easy to attain unanimity with respect to our different concepts 
 of government and human rights The struggle is bound to be difficult and one in which we 
 must be firm but patient If we adhere faithfully to our principles I think it is possible for us to 
 maintain freedom and to do so peacefully and without recourse to force 
 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            
 The future must see the broadening of human rights throughout the world People who have 
 glimpsed freedom will never be content until they have secured it for themselves In a truest 
 sense human rights are a fundamental object of law and government in a just society 
 Human rights exist to the degree that they are   relations with each 
 other   relations with their citizens 
 The world at large is aware of the tragic consequences for human beings ruled by totalitarian 
 systems If we examine Hitler ’s rise to power we see how the chains are forged which keep 
 the individual a slave and we cans e many similarities in the way things are accomplished in 
 other countries Politically men must be free to discuss and to arrive at as many facts as 
 possible and there must beat least a two party system in a country because when there is 
 only one political party too many things can be subordinated to the interests of that one party 
 and it becomes a tyrant and not an instrument of democratic government 
 The propaganda we have witnessed in the recent past like that we perceive in these days 
 seeks to impugn to undermine and to destroy the liberty and independence of peoples Such 
 propaganda poses to all peoples the issue whether to doubt their heritage of rights and 
 therefore to compromise the   live or try to accept the challenge 
 redouble their vigilance and stand steadfast in the struggle to maintain and enlarge human 
 freedoms 
 People who continue to be denied the respect to which they are entitled as human beings will 
 not acquiesce forever in such denial 
 The Charter of the United Nations is a guiding beacon along the way to the achievement of 
 human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world The immediate test is not only 
 to the extent to which human rights and freedoms have already been achieved but the 
 direction in which the world is moving Is there a faithful compliance with the objectives of the 
 Charter if some countries continue to curtail human rights and freedoms instead of to promote 
 the universal respect for an observance of human rights and freedoms for all as called for by 
 the Charter 
 The place to discuss the issue of human rights is in the forum of the United Nations The 
 United Nations has been set up as the common meeting ground for nations where we can 
 consider together our mutual problems and take advantage of our differences in experience It 
 is inherent in our firm attachment to democracy and freedom that we stand always ready to 
 use the fundamental democratic procedures of honest discussion and negotiation It is now as 
 always our hope that despite the wide differences in approach we face in the world today we 
  
  
 
 
                                    
            0 
 can with mutual good faith in the principles of the united Nations Charter arrive at a common 
 basis of understanding 
 We are here to join the meetings of this great international Assembly which meets in your 
 beautiful capital of Paris Freedom for the individual is an inseparable part of the cherished 
 traditions of France As one of the Delegates from the United States I pray Almighty God that 
 we may win another victory here for the rights and freedoms of all men",0.0795854926109314,0.0279330518096685,0.6360083818435669,0.0995314568281173,0.1152958869934082,0.0362673737108707,0.0053783706389367,0.1156767034335526,0.3989378249224134,41.67091461802804,0.2302315421581476,0.007646930303692375,0.05480868665977249,0.03776256785461411,30.111842105263158,1.0
66,Richard M. Nixon,Cambodian Incursion Address,1970," 
 
 
 Good evening my fellow Americans Ten days ago in my report to the nation on Vietnam I 
 announced the decision to withdraw an additional 150,000 Americans from Vietnam over the 
 next year I said then that I was making that decision despite our concern over increased 
 enemy activity in Laos in Cambodia and in South Vietnam And at that time I warned that if I 
 concluded that increased enemy activity in any of these areas endangered the lives of 
 Americans remaining in Vietnam I would not hesitate to take strong and effective measures 
 to deal with that situation Despite that warning North Vietnam has increased its military 
 aggression in all these areas and particularly in Cambodia 
 After full consultation with the National Security Council Ambassador Bunker General Abrams 
 and my other advisors I have concluded that the actions of the enemy in the last 10 days 
 clearly endanger the lives of Americans who are in Vietnam now and would constitute an 
 unacceptable risk to those who will be there after withdrawal of another 150,000 To protect 
 our men who are in Vietnam and to guarantee the continued success of our withdrawal and 
 Vietnamization program I have concluded that the time has come for action  
 Tonight I shall describe the actions of the enemy the actions I have ordered to deal with that 
 situation and the reasons for my decision 
  
  
 
                                               
 Cambodia a small country of seven million people has been a neutral nation since the 
 Geneva Agreement of 1954 an agreement incidentally which was  
 of North Vietnam American policy since then has been to scrupulously respect the neutrality 
 of the Cambodian people We have maintained a skeleton diplomatic mission of fewer than 15 
 in Cambodia ’s capital and that only since last August For the previous four years from 1965 
 to 1969 we did not have any diplomatic mission whatever in Cambodia and for the past five 
 years we have provided no military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to 
 Cambodia 
 North Vietnam however has not respected that neutrality For the past five years as 
 indicated on this map that you see here North Vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries all 
 along the Cambodian frontier with South Vietnam Some of these extend up to 20 miles into 
 Cambodia The sanctuaries are in red and as you note they are on both sides of the border 
 They are used for hit and run attacks on American and South Vietnamese forces in South 
 Vietnam These Communist occupied territories contain major base camps training sites 
 logistics facilities weapons and ammunition factories airstrips and prisoner of war 
 compounds 
 And for five years neither the United States nor South Vietnam has moved against these 
 enemy sanctuaries because we did not wish to violate the territory of a neutral nation Even 
 after the Vietnamese Communists began to expand these sanctuaries four weeks ago we 
 counseled patience to our South Vietnamese allies and imposed restraints on our own 
 commanders 
 In contrast to our policy the enemy in the past two weeks has stepped up his guerrilla actions 
 and he is concentrating his main forces in these sanctuaries that you see in this map where 
 they are building up to launch massive attacks on our forces and those of South Vietnam 
 North Vietnam in the last two weeks has stripped away all pretense of respecting the 
 sovereignty or the neutrality of Cambodia Thousands of their soldiers are invading the 
 country from the sanctuaries They are encircling the capital of Pnompenh Coming from these 
 sanctuaries as you see here they had moved into Cambodia and are encircling the capital 
 Cambodia as a result of this has sent out a call to the United States to a number of other 
 nations for assistance Because if this enemy effort succeeds Cambodia would become a vast 
 enemy staging area and a springboard for attacks on South Vietnam along 600 miles of 
 frontier a refuge where enemy troops could return from combat without fear of retaliation 
  
  
 
                                               
 North Vietnamese men and supplies could then be poured into that country jeopardizing not 
 only the lives of our own men but the people of South Vietnam as well  
 Now confronted with this situation we had three options  
 First we can do nothing Well the ultimate result of that course of action is clear Unless we 
 indulge in wishful thinking the lives of Americans remaining in Vietnam after our next 
 withdrawal of 150,000 would be gravely threatened 
 Let us go to the map again 
 Here is South Vietnam Here is North Vietnam North Vietnam already occupies this part of 
 Laos If North Vietnam also occupied this whole band in Cambodia or the entire country it 
 would mean that South Vietnam was completely outflanked and the forces of Americans in 
 this area as well as the South Vietnamese would be in an untenable military position 
 Our second choice is to provide massive military assistance to Cambodia itself Now 
 unfortunately while we deeply sympathize with the plight of seven million Cambodians whose 
 country has been invaded massive amounts of military assistance could not be rapidly and 
 effectively   Cambodian Army against the immediate trap With other 
 nations we shall do our best to provide the small arms and other equipment which the 
 Cambodian Army of 40,000 needs and can use for its defense But the aid we will provide will 
 be limited for the purpose of enabling Cambodia to defend its neutrality and not for the 
 purpose of making it an active belligerent on one side or the other 
 Our third choice is to go to the heart of the trouble And that means cleaning out major North 
 Vietnamese and Vietcong occupied territories these sanctuaries which serve as bases for 
 attacks on both Cambodia and American and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam 
 Some of these incidentally are as close to Saigon as Baltimore is to Washington This one 
 for example is called the Parrot ’s Beak It ’s only 33 miles from Saigon 
 Now faced with these three options this is the decision I have made In co operation with the 
 armed forces of South Vietnam attacks are being launched this week to clean out major 
 enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian Vietnam border A major responsibility for the ground 
 operations is being   forces 
 
  
  
 
                                               
 For example the attacks in several areas including the parrot ’s beak that I referred to a 
 moment ago are exclusively South Vietnamese ground operations under South Vietnamese 
 command with the United States providing air and logistical support There is one area 
 however immediately above the parrot ’s beak where I have concluded that a combined 
 American and South Vietnamese operation is necessary 
 Tonight American and South Vietnamese units will attack the headquarters for the entire 
 Communist military operation in South Vietnam This key control center has been occupied by 
 the North Vietnamese and Vietcong for five years in blatant violation of Cambodia ’s neutrality 
 This is not an invasion of Cambodia The areas in which these attacks will be launched are 
 completely occupied and   forces Our purpose is not to occupy 
 the areas Once enemy forces are driven out of these sanctuaries and once their military 
 supplies are destroyed we will withdraw 
 These actions are in no way directed to the security interests of any nation Any government 
 that chooses to use these actions as a pretext for harming relations with the United States will 
 be doing so on its own responsibility and on its own initiative and we will draw the 
 appropriate conclusions  
 And now let me give you the reasons for my decision A majority of the American people a 
 majority of you listening to me are for the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam The action I 
 have taken tonight is indispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal program A 
 majority of the American people want to end this war rather than to have it drag on 
 interminably The action I have taken tonight will serve that purpose A majority of the 
 American people want to keep the casualties of our brave men in Vietnam at an absolute 
 minimum The action I take tonight is essential if we are to accomplish that goal  
 We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia but for the 
 purpose of ending the war in Vietnam and winning the just peace we all desire  
 We have made we will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through 
 negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting in the battlefield  
 Let ’s look again at the record 
 
  
  
 
                                               
 We stopped the bombing of North Vietnam We have cut air operations by over 20 per cent 
 We ’ve announced the withdrawal of over 250 000 of our men We ’ve offered to withdraw all 
 of our men if they will withdraw theirs We ’ve offered to negotiate all issues with only one 
 condition and that is that the future of South Vietnam be determined 
 and   States   of South Vietnam themselves 
 The answer of the enemy has been intransigence at the conference table belligerence at 
 Hanoi massive military aggression in Laos and Cambodia and stepped up attacks in South 
 Vietnam designed to increase American casualties 
 This attitude has become intolerable 
 We will not react to this threat to American lives  protests 
 If we did the credibility of the United States would be destroyed in every area of the world 
 where only the power of the United States deters aggression 
 Tonight I again warn the North Vietnamese that if they continue to escalate the fighting when 
 the United States is withdrawing its forces I shall meet my responsibility as commander in 
 chief of our armed forces to take the action I consider necessary to defend the security of our 
 American men 
 The action I have announced tonight puts the leaders of North Vietnam on notice that we will 
 be patient in working for peace We will be conciliatory at the conference table 
 But we will not be humiliated 
 We will not be defeated 
 We will not allow American  to be   from privileged 
 sanctuaries 
 The time came long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiations We stand ready for 
 those negotiations We ’ve made major efforts many of which must remain secret I say 
 tonight all the offers and approaches made previously remain on the conference table 
 whenever Hanoi is ready to negotiate seriously But if the enemy response to our most 
 conciliatory offers for peaceful negotiation continues to be to increase its attacks and 
 humiliate and defeat us we shall react accordingly  
  
  
 
                                               
 My fellow Americans we live in an age of anarchy both abroad and at home We see mindless 
 attacks on all the great institutions which have been   in the last 
 500 years Even here in the United States great universities are being systematically 
 destroyed  
 Small nations all over the world find themselves under attack from within and from without 
 If when the chips are down the world ’s most powerful nation the United States of America 
 acts like a pitiful helpless giant the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free 
 nations and free institutions throughout the world  
 It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight  
 The question all Americans must ask and answer tonight is this Does the richest and 
 strongest nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a 
 group which rejects every effort to win a just peace ignores our warning tramples on solemn 
 agreements violates the neutrality of an unarmed people and uses our prisoners as 
 hostages If we fail to meet this challenge all other nations will be on notice that despite its 
 overwhelming power the United States when a real crisis comes will be found wanting  
 During my campaign for the Presidency I pledged to bring Americans home form Vietnam 
 They are coming home I promised to end this war I shall keep that promise I promised to 
 win a just peace I shall keep that promise We shall avoid a wider war but we are also 
 determined to put an end to this war  
 In this room Woodrow Wilson made the great decisions which led to victory in World War I. 
 Franklin Roosevelt made the decisions which led to our victory in World War II Dwight D. 
 Eisenhower made decisions which ended the war in Korea and avoided war in the Middle East 
 John F. Kennedy in his finest hour made the great decision which removed Soviet nuclear 
 missiles from Cuba and the western hemisphere  
 I have noted that there ’s been a great deal of discussion with regard to this decision that I 
 have made And I should point out I do not contend that it is in the same magnitude as these 
 decisions that I have just mentioned But between those decisions and this decision there is a 
 difference that is very fundamental In those decisions the American people were not assailed 
 by counsels of doubt and defeat from some of the most widely known opinion leaders of the 
 nation  
  
  
 
                                               
 I have noted for example that a Republican Senator has said that this action I have taken 
 means that my party has lost all chance of winning the November elections And others are 
 saying today that this move against enemy sanctuaries will make me a one term President 
 No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of the action I have taken It is 
 tempting to take the easy political path to blame this war on previous Administrations and to 
 bring all of our men home immediately regardless of the consequences even though that 
 would mean defeat for the United States to desert 18 million South Vietnamese people who 
 have put their trust in us to expose them to the same slaughter and savagery which the 
 leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese who chose 
 freedom when the Communists took over North Vietnam in 1954 
 To get peace at any price now even though I know that a peace of humiliation for the United 
 States would lead to a bigger war or surrender later I have rejected all political considerations 
 in making this decision Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives 
 of 400,000 brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace and freedom 
 in Vietnam  
 Whether I may be a one term President is insignificant compared to   to 
 act in this crisis the United States proves itself to be unworthy to lead the forces of freedom in 
 this critical period in world history  
 I would rather be a one term president and do what I believe was right than to be a two term 
 President at the cost of seeing America become a second rate power and to see this nation 
 accept the first defeat in its proud 190 year history  
 I realize in this war there are honest deep differences in this country about whether we 
 should have become involved that there are differences to how the war should have been 
 conducted  
 But the decision I announce tonight transcends those differences for the lives of American 
 men are involved 
 The opportunity for 150,000 Americans to come home in the next 12 months is involved 
 The future of 18 million people in South Vietnam and 7 million people in Cambodia is involved  
 The possibility of winning a just peace in Vietnam and in the Pacific is at stake 
  
  
 
                                               
 It is customary to conclude a speech from the White   for the 
 President of the United States Tonight I depart from that precedent What I ask is far more 
 important I ask for your support for our brave men fighting tonight halfway around the world 
 not for territory not for glory but so that their younger brothers and their sons and your sons 
 can have a chance to grow up in a world of peace and freedom and justice

67,John F. Kennedy,Ich bin ein Berliner I am a Berliner,1963," 
 
 
 I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished Mayor who has symbolized 
 throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin And I am proud to visit the Federal 
 Republic with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years has committed Germany 
 to democracy and freedom and progress and to come here in the company of my fellow 
 American General Clay who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will 
 come again if ever needed 
 Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was civis Romanus sum ""1 Today in the world of 
 freedom the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner 
 I appreciate my interpreter translating my German 
 There are many people in the world who really do n't understand or say they do n't what is 
 the great issue between the free world and the Communist world  
 Let them come to Berlin 
  
  
 
               
       
 
 There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future  
 Let them come to Berlin 
 And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists  
 Let them come to Berlin 
 And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system but it 
 permits us to make economic progress 
 Lass sie nach Berlin kommen 
 Let them come to Berlin 
 Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect But we have never had to put a 
 wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us I want to say on behalf of 
 my countrymen who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic who are far 
 distant from you that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with 
 you even from a distance the story of the last 18 years I know of no town no city that has 
 been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and 
 the determination of the city of West Berlin 
 While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist 
 system for all the world to see we take no satisfaction in it for it is as your Mayor has 
 said an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity separating families 
 dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters and dividing a people who wish to be 
 joined together 
 What is true of this city is true of Germany Real lasting peace in Europe can never be 
 assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men and 
 that is to make a free choice In 18 years of peace and good faith this generation of Germans 
 has earned the right to be free including the right to unite their families and their nation in 
 lasting peace with good will to all people 
  
  
 
               
       
 You live in a defended island of freedom but your life is part of the main So let me ask you 
 as I close to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today to the hopes of tomorrow beyond 
 the freedom merely of this city of Berlin or your country of Germany to the advance of 
 freedom everywhere beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice beyond yourselves and 
 ourselves to all mankind 
 Freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved all are not free When all are free then 
 we look can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country 
 and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe When that day finally 
 comes as it will the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they 
 were in the front lines for almost two decades 
 All free men wherever they may live are citizens of Berlin 
 And therefore as a free man I take pride in the words 
 Ich bin ein Berliner

68,Lyndon Baines Johnson,Address to a Joint Session of Congress on Voting Legislation,1965," 
 
 
 Mr. Speaker Mr. President Members of the Congress 
 I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy I urge every member of 
 both parties Americans of all religions and of all colors from every section of this country to 
 join me in that cause 
 At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in 
 man 's unending search for freedom So it was at Lexington and Concord So it was a century 
 ago at Appomattox So it was last week in Selma Alabama There long suffering men and 
 women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans Many were brutally 
 assaulted One good man a man of God was killed 
  
  
 
             
 There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma There is no cause for self- 
 satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans But there is cause for 
 hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight For the cries of pain 
 and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the 
 majesty of this great government the government of the greatest nation on earth Our 
 mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice 
 to serve man 
 In our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis Our lives have been 
 marked with debate about great issues issues of war and peace issues of prosperity and 
 depression But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself 
 Rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our 
 security but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation 
 The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue 
 And should we defeat every enemy and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars 
 and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation For with 
 a country as with a person What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose 
 his own soul 
 There is no Negro problem There is no Southern problem There is no Northern problem 
 There is only an American problem And we are met here tonight as Americans not as 
 Democrats or Republicans We are met here as Americans to solve that problem 
 This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose The great 
 phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart North and South All men are 
 created equal the governed give me liberty or give me death 
 Well those are not just clever words or those are not just empty theories In their name 
 Americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand 
 there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives 
 Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man This 
 dignity can not be found in a man 's possessions it can not be found in his power or in his 
 position It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others It 
 says that he shall share in freedom he shall choose his leaders educate his children provide 
 for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being To apply any other test 
 to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race or his religion or the place of his 
  
  
 
             
 birth is not only to do injustice it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their 
 lives for American freedom 
 Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be 
 rooted in democracy The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders The 
 history of this country in large measure is the history of the expansion of that right to all of 
 our people Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult But about 
 this there can and should be no argument 
 Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote 
 There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right There is no duty which weighs 
 more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right 
 Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting 
 simply because they are Negroes Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been 
 used to deny this right The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is 
 wrong or the hour is late or the official in charge is absent And if he persists and if he 
 manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell 
 out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application And if he manages 
 to fill out an application he is given a test The registrar is the sole judge of whether he 
 passes this test He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution or explain the most 
 complex provisions of State law And even a college degree can not be used to prove that he 
 can read and write 
 For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin Experience has 
 clearly shown that the existing process of law can not overcome systematic and ingenious 
 discrimination No law that we now have on the books and I have helped to put three of 
 them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it In 
 such a case our duty must be clear to all of us The Constitution says that no person shall be 
 kept from voting because of his race or his color We have all sworn an oath before God to 
 support and to defend that Constitution We must now act in obedience to that oath 
 Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to 
 vote 
 The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders 
 tomorrow After they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill I am grateful for 
  
  
 
             
 this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my 
 friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues   I 've had prepared a 
 more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk 
 tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight But I want to really discuss with you 
 now briefly the main proposals of this legislation 
 This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections Federal State and local 
 which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote   This bill will establish a simple 
 uniform standard which can not be used however ingenious the effort to flout our 
 Constitution It will provide for citizens to be   the United States 
 Government if the State officials refuse to register them It will eliminate tedious 
 unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote Finally this legislation will ensure that 
 properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting 
 I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress I have no doubt that I 
 will get some on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective But 
 experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the 
 Constitution 
 To those who seek to avoid   Government in their own communities 
 who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections the answer is 
 simple open your polling places to all your people 
 Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin 
 Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land 
 There is no constitutional issue here The command of the Constitution is plain There is no 
 moral issue It is wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to 
 vote in this country There is no issue of States rights or national rights There is only the 
 struggle for human rights I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer  
 But the last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to 
 protect voting rights in Federal elections That civil rights bill was passed after eight long 
 months of debate And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature 
 the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated This time on this issue there must be 
 no delay or no hesitation or no compromise with our purpose 
  
  
 
             
 We can not we must not refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every 
 election that he may desire to participate in And we ought not and we can not and we must 
 not wait another eight months before we get a bill We have already waited a hundred years 
 and more and the time for waiting is gone 
 So I ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass 
 this bill And I do n't make that request lightly For from the window where I sit with the 
 problems of our country I recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged 
 conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nations and the harsh judgment of history 
 on our acts 
 But even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over What happened in Selma is part of a 
 far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America It is the effort of 
 American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life Their cause 
 must be our cause too Because it 's not just Negroes but really it 's all of us who must 
 overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice 
 And we shall overcome 
 As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil I know how agonizing racial feelings are I 
 know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society But a century 
 has passed more than a hundred years since the Negro was freed And he is not fully free 
 tonight  
 It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln a great President of another 
 party signed the Emancipation Proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a 
 fact A century has passed more than a hundred years since equality was promised And yet 
 the Negro is not equal A century has passed since the day of promise And the promise is un- 
 kept 
 The time of justice has now come I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it 
 back It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come And when it does I think 
 that day will brighten the lives of every American For Negroes are not the only victims How 
 many white children have gone uneducated How many white families have lived in stark 
 poverty How many white lives have been  we 've wasted our energy 
 and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror 
  
  
 
             
 And   so I say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you 
 to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future 
 This great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all all black 
 and white all North and South sharecropper and city dweller These are the enemies 
 poverty ignorance disease They 're our enemies not our fellow man not our neighbor And 
 these enemies too poverty disease and ignorance we shall overcome 
 Now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another 
 section or the problems of our neighbors There 's really no part of America where the promise 
 of equality has been fully kept In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham in Philadelphia as well as 
 Selma Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom This is one nation What happens in 
 Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American But let each of us 
 look within our own hearts and our own communities and let each of us put our shoulder to 
 the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists 
 As we meet here in this peaceful historic chamber tonight men from the South some of 
 whom were at Iwo Jima men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the 
 world and brought it back without a stain on it men from the East and from the West are all 
 fighting together without regard to religion or color or region in Vietnam Men from every 
 region fought for us across the world twenty years ago 
 And now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its 
 contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in the Great Republic and 
 in some instances a great many of them more 
 And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country from the 
 Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic will 
 rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans 
 For all of us owe this duty and I believe that all of us will respond to it Your President makes 
 that request of every American 
 The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro His actions and protests his courage to 
 risk safety and even to risk his life have awakened the conscience of this nation His 
 demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice designed to provoke change 
 designed to stir reform He has called upon us to make good the promise of America And who 
  
  
 
             
 among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent 
 bravery and his faith in American democracy 
 For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process 
 Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but depends upon the force of moral 
 right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order 
 And there have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days 
 come and go But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be 
 fought in the courts and in the Congress and in the hearts of men 
 We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly But the right of free 
 speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater 
 We must preserve the right to free assembly But free assembly does not carry with it the 
 right to block public thoroughfares to traffic 
 We do have a right to protest and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the 
 constitutional rights of our neighbors And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am 
 permitted to serve in this office 
 We will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we 
 seek progress obedience to law and belief in American values 
 In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace We seek order We seek unity But we 
 will not accept the peace of stifled rights or the order  the unity that 
 stifles protest For peace can not be purchased at the cost of liberty 
 In Selma tonight and we had a good day there as in every city we are working for a just 
 and peaceful settlement And we must all remember that after this speech I am making 
 tonight after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone and after you have 
 promptly passed this bill the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live 
 and work together And when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to 
 heal the wounds and to build a new community 
 This can not be easily done on a battleground of violence as the history of the South itself 
 shows It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly 
 impressive responsibility in recent days last Tuesday again today 
  
  
 
             
 The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill But in a larger sense 
 most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program Its object is to open the 
 city of hope to all people of all races 
 Because all Americans just must have the right to vote And we are going to give them that 
 right All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race And they are 
 going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race 
 But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much 
 more than just legal right It requires a trained mind and a healthy body It requires a decent 
 home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of 
 poverty 
 Of course people can not contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if 
 their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in 
 hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check So we want to open the gates to opportunity 
 But we 're also going to give all our people black and white the help that they need to walk 
 through those gates  
 My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla Texas in a small Mexican American 
 school Few of them could speak English and I could n't speak much Spanish My students 
 were poor and they often came to class without breakfast hungry And they knew even in 
 their youth the pain of prejudice They never seemed to know why people disliked them But 
 they knew it was so because I saw it in their eyes I often walked home late in the afternoon 
 after the classes were finished wishing there was more that I could do But all I knew was to 
 teach them the little that I knew hoping that it might help them against the hardships that 
 lay ahead 
 And somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the 
 hopeful face of a young child I never thought then in 1928 that I would be standing here in 
 1965 It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to 
 help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this 
 country 
 But now I do have that chance and I 'll let you in on a secret I mean to use it 
 And I hope that you will use it with me  
  
  
 
             
 This is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupied this globe The might of 
 past empires is little compared to ours But I do not want to be the President who built 
 empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion  
 I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world  
 I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be tax- 
 payers instead of tax eaters 
 I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the 
 right of every citizen to vote in every election 
 I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who 
 promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties 
 I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth 
 And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana the majority 
 leader the Senator from Illinois the minority leader Mr. McCulloch and other Members of 
 both parties I came here tonight not as President Roosevelt came down one time in 
 person to veto a bonus bill not as President Truman came down one time to urge the 
 passage of a railroad bill but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and 
 to share it with the people that we both work for I want this to be the Congress Republicans 
 and Democrats alike which did all these things for all these people 
 Beyond this great chamber out yonder in fifty States are the people that we serve Who can 
 tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen We 
 all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness 
 how many problems each little family has They look most of all to themselves for their 
 futures But I think that they also look to each of us 
 Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says in Latin God has favored 
 our undertaking God will not favor everything that we do It is rather our duty to divine His

69,Ronald Reagan,First Presidential Inaugural Address,1981," 
 
 
 Senator Hatfield Mr. Chief Justice Mr. President Vice President Bush Vice President Mondale 
 Senator Baker Speaker O’Neill Reverend Moomaw and my fellow citizens 
 To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion And yet in the 
 history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence The orderly transfer of authority as 
 called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few 
 of us stop to think how unique we really are In the eyes of many in the world this every- 
 four year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle 
 Mr. President I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition 
 By your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have shown a watching world that 
 we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual 
 liberty to a greater degree than any other And I thank you and your people for all your help 
 in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our republic 
 The business of our nation goes forward 
  
  
 
                                              
        
 These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions We suffer 
 from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history It distorts 
 our economic decisions penalizes thrift and crushes the struggling young and the fixed- 
 income elderly alike It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people Idle industries 
 have cast workers into unemployment human misery and personal indignity 
 Those who do work are denied a fair return for their   system which penalizes 
 successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity But great as our tax 
 burden is it has not kept pace with public spending For decades we have piled deficit upon 
 deficit mortgaging our future and our children ’s future for the temporary convenience of the 
 present To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social cultural political and 
 economic upheavals 
 You and I as individuals  beyond our means but for only a limited 
 period of time Why then should we think that collectively as a nation we are not bound by 
 that same limitation 
 We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow And let there be no misunderstanding 
 we ’re going to begin to act beginning today The economic ills we suffer have come upon us 
 over several decades They will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away 
 They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now as we have had in the 
 past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom 
 In this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the 
 problem From time to time we ’ve been tempted to believe that society has become too 
 complex to be  that   group is superior to 
 government  the people But if no one among us is capable of governing 
 himself then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else 
 All of us together in and out of government must bear the burden The solutions we seek 
 must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price We hear much of 
 special interest groups Well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been 
 too long neglected It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions and it 
 crosses political party lines It is made up of men and women who raise our food patrol our 
 streets man our mines and factories teach our children keep our homes and heal us when 
 we ’re sick professionals industrialists shopkeepers clerks cabbies and truck drivers They 
 are in short We the People This breed called Americans 
  
  
 
                                              
        
 Well this Administration ’s objective will be a healthy vigorous growing economy that 
 provides equal opportunities for all Americans with no barriers born of bigotry or 
 discrimination Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work 
 Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs 
 All must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the 
 bounty of a revived economy 
 With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can 
 have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world So as we begin let 
 us take inventory 
 We are a nation that has a government not the other way around And this makes us 
 special among the nations of the earth Our Government has no power except that granted it 
 by the people It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of 
 having grown beyond the consent of the governed 
 It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand 
 recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and 
 those reserved to the states or to the people 
 All of us all of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the 
 states the states created the Federal Government 
 Now so there will be no misunderstanding it ’s not my intention to do away with government 
 It is rather to make it work work with us not over us to not ride on our 
 back Government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not 
 stifle it If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much 
 prospered as no other people on earth it was because here in this land we unleashed the 
 energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before 
 Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in 
 any other place on earth The price for this freedom at times has been high but we have 
 never been unwilling to pay that price 
 It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention 
 and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of Government 
  
  
 
                                              
        
 It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams 
 We 're not as some would have us believe doomed to an inevitable decline I do not believe in 
 a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we 
 do nothing 
 So with all the creative energy at our command let us begin an era of national renewal Let 
 us renew our determination our courage and our strength And let us renew our faith and 
 our hope We have every right to dream heroic dreams 
 Those who say that we ’re in a time when there are no heroes they just do n’t know where to 
 look You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates Others a handful in 
 number produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond You meet heroes 
 across a counter and they ’re on both sides of that counter There are entrepreneurs with 
 faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs new wealth and opportunity 
 There are individuals and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary 
 gifts support church charity culture art and education Their patriotism is quiet but deep 
 Their values sustain our national life 
 Now I have used the words they and their in speaking of these heroes I could say you 
 and your because I ’m addressing the heroes of whom I speak you the citizens of this 
 blessed land Your dreams your hopes your goals are going to be the dreams the hopes 
 and the goals of this Administration so help me God 
 We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your make up How can we love our 
 country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when they fall heal 
 them when they ’re sick and provide opportunity to make them self sufficient so they will be 
 equal in fact and not just in theory Can we solve the problems confronting us Well the 
 answer is an unequivocal and emphatic Yes To paraphrase Winston Churchill I did not take 
 the oath I ’ve just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world ’s 
 strongest economy 
 In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and 
 reduced productivity Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various 
 levels of government Progress may be slow measured in inches and feet not miles but 
 we will progress It is time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its 
 means and to lighten our punitive tax burden And these will be our first priorities and on 
 these principles there will be no compromise 
  
  
 
                                              
        
 On the eve or our struggle for independence a man who might ’ve been one of the greatest 
 among the Founding Fathers Dr. Joseph Warren president of the Massachusetts Congress 
 said to his fellow Americans  
 Our country is in danger but not to be despaired of On you depend the fortunes of 
 America You are to decide the important question upon which rest the happiness and 
 the liberty of millions yet unborn Act worthy of yourselves 
 Well I believe we the Americans of today are ready to act worthy of ourselves ready to do 
 what must be done to insure happiness and liberty for ourselves our children and our 
 children ’s children And as we renew ourselves here in our own land we will be seen as having 
 greater strength throughout the world We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a 
 beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom 
 To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic ties and 
 assure them of our support and firm commitment We will match loyalty with loyalty We will 
 strive for mutually beneficial relations We will not use our friendship to impose on their 
 sovereignty for our own sovereignty is not for sale 
 As for the enemies of freedom those who are potential adversaries they will be reminded 
 that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people We will negotiate for it sacrifice 
 for it we will not surrender for it now or ever Our forbearance should never be 
 misunderstood Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will When 
 action is required to preserve our national security we will act We will maintain sufficient 
 strength to prevail if need be knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never 
 having to use that strength 
 Above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so 
 formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women It is a weapon our 
 adversaries in today 's world do not have It is a weapon that we as Americans do have Let 
 that be   practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors 
 I am I 'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day and for 
 that I am deeply grateful We are a nation under God and I believe God intended for us to be 
 free It would be fitting and good I think if on each inaugural day in future years it should be 
 declared a day of prayer 
 This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you ’ve been told on 
 this West Front of the Capitol 
  
  
 
                                              
        
 Standing here one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city ’s special beauty and 
 history At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we 
 stand Directly in front of me the monument to a monumental man George Washington 
 father of our country A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly He led America 
 out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood Off to one side the stately memorial to 
 Thomas Jefferson The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence And then 
 beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial Whoever would 
 understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln 
 Beyond those moments those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River and on the far 
 shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row upon row of simple white 
 markers bearing crosses or Stars of David They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that 
 has been paid for our freedom 
 Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier Their lives 
 ended in places called Belleau Wood the Argonne Omaha Beach Salerno and halfway 
 around the world on Guadalcanal Tarawa Pork Chop Hill the Chosin Reservoir and in a 
 hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam 
 Under one such a marker lies a young man Martin Treptow who left his job in a small town 
 barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division There on the Western 
 front he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy fire We 're told 
 that on his body was found a diary On the flyleaf under the heading My Pledge he had 
 written these words  
 America must win this war Therefore I will work I will save I will sacrifice I will 
 endure I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle 
 depended on me alone 
 The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow 
 and so many thousands of others were called upon to make It does require however our 
 best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to 
 perform great deeds to believe that together with God ’s help we can and will resolve the 
 problems which now confront us 
 And after all why should n’t we believe that We are Americans

70,Jimmy Carter,Energy and the National Goals A Crisis of Confidence,1979," 
 
 
 Good Evening 
 This a special night for me Exactly three years ago on July 15 1976 I accepted the 
 nomination of my party to run for President of the United States I promised you a President 
 who is not isolated from the people who feels your pain and who shares your dreams and 
 who draws his strength and his wisdom from you 
 During the past three years I ’ve spoken to you on many occasions about national concerns 
 the energy crisis reorganizing the government our nation ’s economy and issues of war and 
 especially peace But over those years the subjects of the speeches the talks and the press 
 conferences have become increasingly narrow focused more and more on what the isolated 
 world of Washington thinks is important Gradually you ’ve heard more and more about what 
 the government thinks or what the government should be doing and less and less about our 
 nation ’s hopes our dreams and our vision of the future 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 Ten days ago I had planned to speak to you again about a very important subject energy 
 For the fifth time I would have described the urgency of the problem and laid out a series of 
 legislative recommendations to the Congress But as I was preparing to speak I began to ask 
 myself the same question that I now know has been troubling many of you Why have we not 
 been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem 
 It ’s clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper deeper than gasoline lines 
 or energy shortages deeper even than inflation or recession And I realize more than ever 
 that as President I need your help So I decided to reach out and to listen to the voices of 
 America 
 I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our society business and 
 labor teachers and preachers governors mayors and private citizens And then I left Camp 
 David to listen to other Americans men and women like you It has been an extraordinary ten 
 days and I want to share with you what I ’ve heard 
 First of all I got a lot of personal advice Let me quote a few of the typical comments that I 
 wrote down 
 This from a southern governor Mr. President you are not leading this nation you ’re just 
 managing the government 
 You do n’t see the people enough anymore 
 Some of your Cabinet members do n’t seem loyal There is not enough discipline among your 
 disciples 
 Do n’t talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government but about an understanding 
 of our common good 
 Mr. President we ’re in trouble Talk to us about blood and sweat and tears 
 If you lead Mr. President we will follow 
 Many people talked about themselves and about the condition of our nation This from a 
 young woman in Pennsylvania I feel so far from government I feel like ordinary people are 
 excluded from political power 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 And this from a young Chicano Some of us have suffered from recession all our lives 
 Some people have wasted energy but others have n’t had anything to waste 
 And this from a religious leader No material shortage can touch the important things like 
 God ’s love for us or our love for one another 
 And I like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the mayor of a small 
 Mississippi town The big shots are not the only ones who are important Remember you 
 ca n’t sell anything on Wall Street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first 
 This kind of summarized a lot of other statements Mr. President we are confronted with a 
 moral and a spiritual crisis 
 Several of our discussions were on energy and I have a notebook full of comments and 
 advice I ’ll read just a few 
 We ca n’t go on consuming forty percent more energy then we produce When we import oil 
 we are also importing inflation plus unemployment 
 We ’ve got to use what we have The Middle East has only five percent of the world ’s energy 
 but the United States has twenty four percent 
 And this is one of the most vivid statements Our neck is stretched over the fence and OPEC 
 has a knife 
 There will be other cartels and other shortages American wisdom and courage right now can 
 set a path to follow in the future 
 This was a good one Be bold Mr. President We may make mistakes but we are ready to 
 experiment 
 And this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it The real issue is freedom We must 
 deal with the energy problem on a war footing 
 And the last that I ’ll read When we enter the moral equivalent of war Mr. President do n’t 
 issue us BB guns 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 These ten days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the 
 American people but it also bore out some of my longstanding concerns about our nation ’s 
 underlying problems 
 
 I know of course being President that government actions and legislation can be very 
 important That ’s why I ’ve worked hard to put my campaign promises into law and I have to 
 admit with just mixed success But after listening to the American people I have been 
 reminded again that all the legislation in the world ca n’t fix what ’s wrong with America So I 
 want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation 
 I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy 
 I do not mean our political and civil liberties They will endure And I do not refer to the 
 outward strength of America a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world with 
 unmatched economic power and military might 
 The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways 
 It is a crisis of confidence 
 It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will We can see 
 this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity 
 of purpose for our nation 
 The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political 
 fabric of America 
 The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a 
 proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July It is the idea which founded 
 our nation and has guided our development as a people Confidence in the future has 
 supported everything else public institutions and private enterprise our own families and 
 the very Constitution of the United States Confidence has defined our course and has served 
 as a link between generations We ’ve always believed in something called progress We ’ve 
 always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own 
 Our people are losing that faith not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to 
 serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy As a people we know our past and 
 we are proud of it Our progress has been part of the living history of America even the 
 world We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 democracy involved in the search for freedom and that belief has always strengthened us in 
 our purpose But just as we are losing our confidence in the future we are also beginning to 
 close the door on our past 
 In a nation that was proud of hard work strong families close knit communities and our faith 
 in God too many of us now tend to worship self indulgence and consumption Human identity 
 is no longer   does   owns But we ’ve discovered that 
 owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning We ’ve learned 
 that piling up material goods can not fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or 
 purpose 
 The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us For the first time in the 
 history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse 
 than the past five years Two thirds of our people do not even vote The productivity of 
 American workers is actually dropping and the willingness of Americans to save for the future 
 has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world 
 As you know there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools 
 the news media and other institutions This is not a message of happiness or reassurance 
 but it is the truth and it is a warning 
 These changes did not happen overnight They ’ve come upon us gradually over the last 
 generation years that were filled with shocks and tragedy 
 We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot not the bullet until the murders of John 
 Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. We were taught that our armies 
 were always invincible and our causes were always just only to suffer the agony of Vietnam 
 We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate 
 We remember when the phrase sound as a dollar was an expression of absolute 
 dependability until ten years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our savings We 
 believed that our nation ’s resources were limitless until 1973 when we had to face a growing 
 dependence on foreign oil 
 These wounds are still very deep They have never been healed 
 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 Looking for a way out of this crisis our people have turned to the Federal Government and 
 found it isolated from the mainstream of our nation ’s life Washington D.C. has become an 
 island The gap between our citizens and our government has never been so wide The people 
 are looking for honest answers not easy answers clear leadership not false claims and 
 evasiveness and politics as usual 
 What you see too often in Washington and elsewhere around the country is a system of 
 government that seems incapable of action You see a Congress twisted and pulled in every 
  well financed and powerful special interests 
 You see every extreme position defended to the last vote almost to the last breath by one 
 unyielding group or another You often see a balanced and a fair approach that demands 
 sacrifice a little sacrifice from everyone abandoned like an orphan without support and 
 without friends 
 Often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift You do n’t like it and neither do I. What can 
 we do 
 First of all we must face the truth and then we can change our course We simply must have 
 faith in each other faith in our ability to govern ourselves and faith in the future of this 
 nation Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we 
 face It is a true challenge of this generation of Americans 
 One of the visitors to Camp David last week put it this way We ’ve got to stop crying and 
 start sweating stop talking and start walking stop cursing and start praying The strength we 
 need will not come from the White House but from every house in America 
 We know the strength of America We are strong We can regain our unity We can regain our 
 confidence We are the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and 
 awesome than those that challenge us now Our fathers and mothers were strong men and 
 women who shaped a new society during the Great Depression who fought world wars and 
 who carved out a new charter of peace for the world 
 We ourselves are the same Americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon We are 
 the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human rights and equality And we 
 are the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process rebuild 
 the unity and confidence of America 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 We are at a turning point in our history There are two paths to choose One is a path I ’ve 
 warned about tonight the path that leads to fragmentation and self interest Down that road 
 lies a mistaken idea of freedom the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others 
 That path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and 
 immobility It is a certain route to failure 
 All the traditions of our past all the lessons of our heritage all the promises of our future 
 point to another path the path of common purpose and the restoration of American values 
 That path leads to true freedom for our nation and ourselves We can take the first steps 
 down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem 
 Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation and it can also be the 
 standard around which we rally On the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new 
 confidence and we can seize control again of our common destiny  
 In little more than two decades we ’ve gone from a position of energy independence to one in 
 which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going 
 through the roof Our excessive dependence on OPEC has already taken a tremendous toll on 
 our economy and our people This is the direct cause of the long lines which have made 
 millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline It ’s a cause of the increased 
 inflation and unemployment that we now face This intolerable dependence on foreign oil 
 threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation 
 The energy crisis is real It is worldwide It is a clear and present danger to our nation These 
 are facts and we simply must face them 
 What I have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important 
 Point one I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States 
 Beginning this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 
 never From now on every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own 
 production and our own conservation The generation long growth in our dependence on 
 foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now and then reversed as we move through 
 the 1980s for I am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by 
 one- of the next decade a saving of over four and a half million barrels of 
 imported oil per day 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 Point two To ensure that we meet these targets I will use my presidential authority to set 
 import quotas I ’m announcing tonight that for 1979 and 1980 I will forbid the entry into this 
 country of one drop of foreign oil more than these goals allow These quotas will ensure a 
 reduction in imports even below the ambitious levels we set at the recent Tokyo summit 
 Point three To give us energy security I am asking for the most massive peacetime 
 commitment of funds and resources in our nation ’s history to develop America ’s own 
 alternative sources of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant products for gasohol from 
 unconventional gas from the sun 
 I propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace two and 
 a half million barrels of imported oil per day by 1990 The corporation will issue up to five 
 billion dollars in energy bonds and I especially want them to be in small denominations so 
 average Americans can invest directly in America ’s energy security 
 Just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win World War II so will we mobilize 
 American determination and ability to win the energy war Moreover I will soon submit 
 legislation to Congress calling for the creation of this nation ’s first solar bank which will help 
 us achieve the crucial goal of twenty percent of our energy coming from solar power by the 
 year 2000 
 These efforts will cost money a lot of money and that is why Congress must enact the 
 windfall profits tax without delay It will be money well spent Unlike the billions of dollars that 
 we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil these funds will be  
 Americans These will go to fight not to increase inflation and unemployment 
 Point four I ’m asking Congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that our nation ’s 
 utility companies cut their massive use of   within the next decade and 
 switch to other fuels especially coal our most abundant energy source 
 Point five To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of achieving these goals 
 I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization board which like the War Production 
 Board in World War II will have the responsibility and authority to cut through the red tape 
 the delays and the endless roadblocks to completing key energy projects 
 We will protect our environment But when this nation critically needs a refinery or a pipeline 
 we will build it 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 
 Point six I ’m proposing a bold conservation program to involve every state county and city 
 and every average American in our energy battle This effort will permit you to build 
 conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost you can afford 
 I ask Congress to give me authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline 
 rationing To further conserve energy I ’m proposing tonight an extra ten billion dollars over 
 the next decade to strengthen our public transportation systems And I ’m asking you for your 
 good and for your nation ’s security to take no unnecessary trips to use carpools or public 
 transportation whenever you can to park your car one extra day per week to obey the speed 
 limit and to set your thermostats to save fuel Every act of energy conservation like this is 
 more than just common sense I tell you it is an act of patriotism 
 Our nation must be fair to the poorest among us so we will increase aid to needy Americans 
 to cope with rising energy prices We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice In 
 fact it is the most painless and immediate ways of rebuilding our nation ’s strength Every 
 gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production It gives us more freedom more 
 confidence that much more control over our own lives 
 So the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our 
 country It can rekindle our sense of unity our confidence in the future and give our nation 
 and all of us individually a new sense of purpose 
 You know we can do it We have the natural resources We have more oil in our shale alone 
 than several Saudi Arabias We have more coal than any nation on earth We have the world ’s 
 highest level of technology We have the most skilled work force with innovative genius and 
 I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war 
 I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy I do not promise a quick way 
 out of our nation ’s problems when the truth is that the only way out is an all out effort What 
 I do promise you is that I will lead our fight and I will enforce fairness in our struggle and I 
 will ensure honesty And above all I will act 
 We can manage the short term shortages more effectively and we will but there are no 
 short term solutions to our long range problems There is simply no way to avoid sacrifice 
 
  
  
 
                                      
            
            
                  
      
      
             
       
       
           
        
                                                                 0 
 Twelve hours from now I will speak again in Kansas City to expand and to explain further our 
 energy program Just as the search for solutions to our energy shortages has now led us to a 
 new awareness of our nation ’s deeper problems so our willingness to work for those solutions 
 in energy can strengthen us to attack those deeper problems 
 I will continue to travel this country to hear the people of America You can help me to 
 develop a national agenda for the 1980s I will listen and I will act We will act together 
 These were the promises I made three years ago and I intend to keep them 
  can and we must rebuild our confidence We can spend until we empty our 
 treasuries and we may summon all the wonders of science But we can succeed only if we tap 
 our greatest resources America ’s people America ’s values and America ’s confidence 
 I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our people In the days 
 to come let us renew that strength in the struggle for an energy secure nation 
 In closing let me say this I will do my best but I will not do it alone Let your voice be 
 heard Whenever you have a chance say something good about our country With God ’s help 
 and for the sake of our nation it is time for us to join hands in America Let us commit 
 ourselves together to a rebirth of the American spirit Working together with our common faith 
 we can not fail 
 Thank you and good night

71,Shirley Chisholm,For the Equal Rights Amendment,1970," 
 
 Mr. Speaker House Joint Resolution 264 before us today which provides for equality under 
 the law for both men and women represents one of the most clear cut opportunities we are 
 likely to have to declare our faith in the principles that shaped our Constitution It provides a 
 legal basis for attack on the most subtle most pervasive and most institutionalized form of 
 prejudice that exists Discrimination against women solely on the basis of their sex is so 
 widespread that is seems to many persons normal natural and right 
 Legal expression of prejudice on the grounds of religious or political belief has become a minor 
 problem in our society Prejudice on the basis of race is at least under systematic attack 
 There is reason for optimism that it will start to die with the present older generation 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 It is time we act to assure full equality of opportunity to those citizens who although in a 
 majority suffer the restrictions that are commonly imposed on minorities to women 
 The argument that this amendment will not solve the problem of sex discrimination is not 
 relevant If the argument were used against a civil rights bill as it has been used in the past 
 the prejudice that lies behind it would be embarrassing Of course laws will not eliminate 
 prejudice from the hearts of human beings But that is no reason to allow prejudice to 
 continue to be enshrined in our laws to perpetuate injustice through inaction 
 The amendment is necessary to clarify countless ambiguities and inconsistencies in our legal 
 system For instance the Constitution guarantees due process of law in the 5th and 14th 
 amendments But the applicability of due process of sex distinctions is not clear Women are 
 excluded from some State colleges and universities In some States restrictions are placed on 
 a married woman who engages in an independent business Women may not be chosen for 
 some juries Women even receive heavier criminal penalties than men who commit the same 
 crime 
 What would the legal effects of the equal rights amendment really be 
 The equal rights amendment would govern only the relationship between the State and its 
 citizens not relationships between private citizens The amendment would be largely self- 
 executing that is and Federal or State laws in conflict would be ineffective one year after 
 date of ratification without further  
 Opponents of the amendment claim its ratification would throw the law into a state of 
 confusion and would result in much litigation to establish its meaning This objection overlooks 
 the influence of legislative history in determining intent and the recent activities of many 
 groups preparing for legislative changes in this direction 
 State labor laws applying only to women such as those limiting hours of work and weights to 
 be lifted would become inoperative unless the legislature amended them to apply to men As 
 of early 1970 most States would have some laws that would be affected However changes 
 are being made so rapidly as a result of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 it is likely that 
 by the time the Equal Rights Amendment would become effective no conflicting State laws 
 would remain 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 In any event there has for years been great controversy as to the usefulness to women of 
 these State labor laws There has never been any doubt that they worked a hardship on 
 women who need or want to work overtime and on women who need or want better paying 
 jobs and there has been no persuasive evidence as to how many women benefit from the 
 archaic policy of the laws After the Delaware hours law was repealed in 1966 there were no 
 complaints from women to any of the State agencies that might have been approached 
 Jury service laws not making women equally liable for jury service would have been revised 
 The selective service law would have to include women but women would not be required to 
 serve in the Armed Forces where they are not fitted any more than men are required to serve 
 Military service while a great responsibility is not without benefits particularly for young men 
 with limited education or training Since October 1966 246,000 young men who did not meet 
 the normal mental or physical requirements have been given opportunities for training and 
 correcting physical problems This opportunity is not open to their sisters Only girls who have 
 completed high school and meet high standards on the educational test can volunteer 
 Ratification of the amendment would not permit application of higher standards to women 
 Survivorship benefits would be available to husbands of female workers on the same basis as 
 to wives of male workers The Social Security Act and the civil service and military service 
 retirement acts are in conflict Public schools and universities could not be limited to one sex 
 and could not apply different admission standards to men and women Laws requiring longer 
 prison sentences for women than men would be invalid and equal opportunities for 
 rehabilitation and vocational training would have to be provided in public correctional 
 institutions Different ages of majority based on sex would have to be harmonized Federal 
 State and other governmental bodies would be obligated to follow nondiscriminatory practices 
 in all aspects of employment including public school teachers and State university and college 
 faculties 
 What would be the economic effects of the Equal Rights Amendment  
 Direct economic effects would be minor If any labor laws applying only to women still 
 remained their amendment or repeal would provide opportunity for women in better paying 
 jobs in manufacturing More opportunities in public vocational and graduate schools for 
 women would also tend to open up opportunities in better jobs for women  
  
  
 
 
 
            
 Indirect effects could be much greater The focusing of public attention on the gross legal 
 economic and social discrimination against   debates in the Federal 
 and State legislatures would result in changes in attitude of parents educators and 
 employers that would bring about substantial economic changes in the long run Sex prejudice 
 cuts both ways Men are   of the Selective Service Act by 
 enforced legal guardianship of minors   Each sex I believe should be 
 liable when necessary to serve and defend this country Each has a responsibility for the 
 support of children 
 There are objections raised to wiping out laws protecting women workers No one would 
 condone exploitation But what does sex have to do with it Working conditions and hours that 
 are harmful to women are harmful to men wages that are unfair for women are unfair for 
 men Laws setting employment limitations on the basis of sex are irrational and the proof of 
 this is their inconsistency from State to State The physical characteristics of men and women 
 are not fixed but cover two wide spans that have a great deal of overlap It is obvious I 
 think that a robust woman could be more fit for physical labor than a weak man The choice 
 of occupation would be and the rewards for equal works 
 should be equal 
 This is what it comes down to artificial distinctions between persons must be wiped out of the 
 law Legal discrimination between the sexes is in almost every instance founded on 
 outmoded views of society and the pre scientific beliefs about psychology and physiology It is 
 time to sweep away these relics of the past and set future generations free of them 
 Federal agencies and institutions responsible for the enforcement of equal opportunity laws 
 need the authority of a Constitutional amendment 
 The 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1963 Equal Pay Act are not enough they are limited in their 
 coverage for instance one excludes teachers and the other leaves out administrative and 
 professional women The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has not proven to be an 
 adequate device with its power limited to investigation conciliation and recommendation to 
 the Justice Department In its cases involving sexual discrimination it has failed in more than 
 one half 
  
  
 
 
 
            
 The Justice Department has been even less effective It has intervened in only one case 
 involving discrimination on the basis of sex and this was on a procedural point In a second 
 case in which both sexual and racial discrimination were alleged the racial bias charge was 
 given far greater weight 
 Evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex should hardly have to be cited here It is in the 
 Labor Department ’s employment and salary figures for anyone who is still in doubt Its 
 elimination will involve so many changes in our State and Federal laws that without the 
 authority and impetus of this proposed amendment it will perhaps take another 194 years 
 We can not be parties to continuing a delay 
 The time is clearly now to put this House on record for the fullest expression of that equality 
 of opportunity which our Founding Fathers professed They professed it but they did not 
 assure it to their daughters as they tried to do for their sons The Constitution they wrote was 
 designed to protect the rights of white male citizens As there were no black Founding 
 Fathers there were no founding mothers a great pity on both counts It is not too late to 
 complete the work they left undone Today here we should start to do so 
 In closing I would like to make one point Social and psychological effects will be initially 
 more important than legal or economic results As Leo Kanowitz has pointed out 
 Rules of law that treat of the sexes per se inevitably produce far reaching effects 
 upon social psychological and economic aspects of male female relations beyond the 
 limited confines of legislative chambers and courtrooms As long as organized legal 
 systems at once the most respected and most feared of social institutions continue to 
 differentiate sharply in treatment or in words between men and women on the basis 
 of irrelevant and artificially created distinctions the likelihood of men and women 
 coming to regard one another primarily as fellow human beings and only secondarily as 
 representatives of another sex will continue to be remote When men and women are 
 prevented from recognizing one another ’s essential 
  well as social institutions society as a whole remains less than it 
 could otherwise become.1

72,Theodore Teddy Roosevelt,The Man with the Muck rake,1906," 
 
 Over a century ago Washington laid the corner stone of the Capitol in what was then little 
 more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the Potomac We now find it necessary to 
  buildings for the business of the government 
 This growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the 
 way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has 
 grown We now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of 
 population has been   of wealth in complex interests The material 
 problems that face us today are not such as they were in Washington 's time but the 
 underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then Under altered external 
 form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in Washington 's time 
 and are   It is about some of these that I wish to say a 
 word today 
 In Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress you may recall the description of the Man with the Muck 
 Rake the man who could look no way but downward with the muck rake in his hand who 
 was offered a celestial crown for his muck rake but who would neither look up nor regard the 
 crown he was offered but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 In Pilgrim 's Progress the Man with the Muck Rake is set forth as the example of him whose 
 vision is fixed on carnal instead of spiritual things Yet he also typifies the man who in this life 
 consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only 
 on that which is vile and debasing 
 Now it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing 
 There is filth on the floor and it must be scraped up with the muck rake and there are times 
 and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed 
 But the man who never does anything else who never thinks or speaks or writes save of his 
 feats with the muck rake speedily becomes not a help but one of the most potent forces for 
 evil 
 There are in the body politic economic and social many and grave evils and there is urgent 
 necessity for the sternest war upon them There should be relentless exposure of and attack 
 upon every evil man whether politician or business man every evil practice whether in 
 politics business or social life I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who 
 on the platform or in a book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such 
 attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is 
 absolutely truthful 
 The liar is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may 
 be worse than most thieves It puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest 
 man or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth 
 An epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does no good but very great harm The 
 soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed or even when a 
 scoundrel is untruthfully assailed 
 Now it is easy to twist out of shape what I have just said easy to affect to misunderstand it 
 and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it Some persons are 
 sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce mud slinging does not mean the 
 endorsement of whitewashing and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing 
 and those others who practice mud slinging like to encourage such confusion of ideas 
 One of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business 
 or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the 
 unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked who ought to be exposed who 
 ought if possible to be put in the penitentiary If Aristides is praised overmuch as just 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 people get tired of hearing it and over censure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons 
 results in their favor 
 Any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction and unfortunately the reactions instead of 
 taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess is apt to take the form either of 
 punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity and even strength to offenders The 
 effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in 
 public calamity Gross and reckless assaults on character whether on the stump or in 
 newspaper magazine or book create a morbid and vicious public sentiment and at the same 
 time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent 
 them from entering the public service at any price 
 As an instance in point I may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the 
 right type of men to dig the Panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed both 
 without and I am sorry to say sometimes within Congress to utterly reckless assaults on 
 their character and capacity 
 At the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to but for the most 
 unsparing exposure of the politician who betrays his trust of the big business man who 
 makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways There should be a resolute effort 
 to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced Expose the crime and hunt 
 down the criminal but remember that even in the case of crime if it is attacked in 
 sensational lurid and untruthful fashion the attack may do more damage to the public mind 
 than the crime itself 
 It is because I feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil 
 that I ask the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution The men with the muck 
 rakes are often indispensable to the well being of society but only if they know when to stop 
 raking the muck and to look upward to the celestial crown above them to the crown of 
 worthy endeavor There are beautiful things above and round about them and if they 
 gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck their power of usefulness is 
 gone 
 If the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals 
 for distinction from their fellows Such painting finally induces a kind of moral color blindness 
 and people   to the conclusion that no man is really black and no man 
 really white but they are all gray 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 In other words they neither believe in the truth of the attack nor in the honesty of the man 
 who is attacked they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense it becomes well 
 nigh hopeless to stir them either to wrath against wrongdoing or to enthusiasm for what is 
 right and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave and is the despair 
 of honest men To assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with 
 such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general 
 condemnation means the searing of the public con science 
 There results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption 
 or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad Either attitude 
 is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole 
 The fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is well nigh 
 as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad There is nothing 
 more distressing to every good patriot to every good American than the hard scoffing spirit 
 which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter 
 Such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot for it denotes not merely the 
 vacant mind but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow 
 to fruition There is any amount of good in the world and there never was a time when loftier 
 and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now The 
 forces that tend for evil are great and terrible but the forces of truth and love and courage 
 and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before It is a foolish 
 and timid no less than a wicked thing to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong but 
 it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good 
 Hysterical sensationalism is the poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness 
 The men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time whether in the 
 public press or in magazines or in books are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the 
 work for social and political betterment But if they give good reason for distrust of what they 
 say if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue they thereby betray 
 the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at 
 war 
 In his Ecclesiastical Polity that fine old Elizabethan divine Bishop Hooker wrote 
 He that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as 
 they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers because they know 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject but the secret lets 
 and difficulties which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable they have 
 not ordinarily the judgment to consider 
 This truth should be kept constantly in   people desiring to preserve the 
 sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of self government Yet on the other 
 hand it is vital not to permit this spirit of sanity and self command to degenerate into mere 
 mental stagnation Bad though a state of hysterical excitement is and evil though the results 
 are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces yet a 
 sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse 
 At this moment we are passing through a period of great unrest social political and industrial 
 unrest 
 It is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of 
 mere rebelliousness against life of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of 
 conditions but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the 
 individual and the nation 
 So far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce 
 discontent with evil of a determination to punish the authors of evil whether in industry or 
 politics the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life 
 If on the other hand it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite of a contest 
 between the brutal greed of the have nots and the brutal greed of the haves then it has 
 no significance for good but only for evil If it seeks to establish a line of cleavage not along 
 the line which divides good men from bad but along that other line running at right angles 
 thereto which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off then it will be 
 fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic 
 We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man 
 of no capital The wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to 
 bring some trust magnate to account for his misdeeds is as bad as and no worse than the 
 so called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some 
 other labor leader who is implicated in murder One attitude is as bad as the other and no 
 worse in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice and in neither case is there need 
 of   can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 It is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion 
 shall be translated into action and that the action shall be  and 
 self restraint There is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform The reform that counts is 
 that which comes through steady continuous growth violent emotionalism leads to 
 exhaustion 
 It is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of 
 enormous fortunes and the use of those fortunes both corporate and individual in business 
 We should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well won and fortunes ill won 
 between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a 
 whole and those gained in evil   within the limits of mere law honesty 
 Of course no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for 
 misconduct in making them 
 As a matter of personal conviction and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate 
 the system I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme 
 as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount either given in life or 
 devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual a tax so framed as to put it out of the 
 power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount 
 to any one individual the tax of course to be   and not the state 
 government Such taxation should of course be aimed merely at the inheritance or 
 transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits Again the 
 national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in 
 interstate business and all large corporations engaged in interstate business whether by 
 license or otherwise so as to permit us to deal with the far reaching evils of 
 overcapitalization 
 This year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these 
 economic   rate legislation 
 Such legislation if so framed as I am sure it will be as to secure definite and tangible results 
 will amount to something of itself and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is 
 taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate 
 wealth engaged in interstate commerce this superintendence and control not to be exercised 
 in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth but with the firm 
 purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at 
 large 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 The first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations 
 whether as legislators or as executives is honesty This honesty can be no respecter of 
 persons There can be no such thing as unilateral honesty The danger is not really from 
 corrupt corporations it springs from the corruption itself whether exercised for or against 
 corporations 
 The eighth commandment reads Thou shalt not steal It does not read Thou shalt not 
 steal from the rich man It does not read Thou shalt not steal from the poor man It reads 
 simply and plainly Thou shalt not steal 
 No good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the 
 misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense which 
 denounces bribery but blinds itself to blackmail which foams with rage if a corporation 
 secures and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is 
 itself wronged 
 The only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against 
 the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the 
 corporation itself from wrongful aggression 
 If a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to 
 rich corporations it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly 
 and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation 
 But in addition to honesty we need sanity No honesty will make a public man useful if that 
 man is timid or foolish if he is a hot headed zealot or an impracticable visionary As we strive 
 for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long uphill pull 
 On the contrary there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work To depend only 
 on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset 
 The men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business 
 in the interest of the   government authorities will not succeed in my 
 judgment in checking the progress of the movement 
 But if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the 
 whirlwind for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform 
   natural growth 
  
  
 
                                          
       
 On the other hand the wild preachers of unrest and discontent the wild agitators against the 
 entire existing order the men who act crookedly whether because of sinister design or from 
 mere puzzle headedness the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute 
 for what they intend to destroy or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than 
 the existing evils all these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform If they get 
 their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under 
 the present system If they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by 
 provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching 
 would enthrone more securely than ever the evils which their misguided followers believe they 
 are attacking 
 More important than aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man 
 The welfare of the wage worker the welfare of the tiller of the soil upon these depend the 
 welfare of the entire country their good is not to be sought in pulling down others but their 
 good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship 
 Materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men so that each 
 shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made Spiritually and ethically we 
 must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking We appreciate that the things of the 
 body are important but we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more 
 important 
 The foundation stone of national life is and ever must be the high individual character of the 
 average citizen",0.0404336936771869,0.9203727841377258,0.0177329182624816,0.0010233666980639,0.0108118327334523,0.0082441186532378,0.0013813156401738,-0.0263839826839827,0.5838399711399709,45.044555900621134,0.3079710144927536,0.002877321475281193,0.08891671884783969,0.04139309163574079,39.01020408163265,1.0
73,Woodrow Wilson,First Presidential Inaugural Address,1913," 
 There has been a change of government It began two years ago when the House of Representatives 
 became   majority It has now been completed The Senate about to assemble will 
 also be Democratic The offices of President and Vice President have been put into the hands of 
 Democrats What does the change mean That is the question that is uppermost in our minds to day That 
 is the question I am going to try to answer in order if I may to interpret the occasion 
 It means much more than the mere success of a party The success of a party means little except when the 
 Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose No one can mistake the purpose for which the 
 Nation now seeks to use the Democratic Party It seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and 
 point of view Some old things with which we had grown familiar and which had begun to creep into the very 
 habit of our thought and of our lives have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon 
 them with fresh awakened eyes have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister 
 Some new things as we look frankly upon them willing to comprehend their real character have come to 
 assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar stuff of our own convictions We have been 
  insight into our own life 
 We see that in many things that life is very great It is incomparably great in its material aspects in its body 
 of wealth in the diversity and sweep of its energy in the industries which have been conceived and built up 
 by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men It is great also very great in 
 its moral force Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the 
 beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong alleviate 
  
  
 
                         
          
          
           
       
 suffering and set the weak in the way of strength and hope We have built up moreover a great system of 
 government which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set 
 liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change against storm and accident Our life 
 contains every great thing and contains it in rich abundance 
 But the evil has come with the good and much fine gold has been corroded With riches has come 
 inexcusable waste We have squandered a great part of what we might have used and have not stopped to 
 conserve the exceeding bounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have been 
 worthless and impotent scorning to be careful shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient We have 
 been proud of our industrial achievements but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count 
 the human cost the cost of lives snuffed out of energies overtaxed and broken the fearful physical and 
 spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen 
 pitilessly the years through The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears the solemn moving 
 undertone of our life coming up out of the mines and factories and out of every home where the struggle 
 had its intimate and familiar seat With the great Government went many deep secret things which we too 
 long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid fearless eyes The great Government we loved has too 
 often been made use of for private and selfish purposes and those who used it had forgotten the people 
 At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole We see the bad with the good the debased 
 and decadent with the sound and vital With this vision we approach new affairs Our duty is to cleanse to 
 reconsider to restore to correct the evil without impairing the good to purify and humanize every process of 
 our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it There has been something crude and heartless 
 and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great Our thought has been Let every man look out for 
 himself let every generation look out for itself while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible 
 that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves We 
 had not forgotten our morals We remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to 
 serve the humblest as well as the most powerful with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play 
 and remembered it with pride But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great 5 We have come now 
 to the sober second thought The scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes We have made up our 
 minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the 
 beginning and have always carried at our hearts Our work is a work of restoration 
 We have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of 
 the chief items A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world violates the just 
 principles of taxation and makes the Government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests a 
 banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago 
 and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits an industrial system which take it on all 
 its sides financial as well as administrative holds capital in leading strings restricts the liberties and limits 
  
  
 
                         
          
          
           
       
 the opportunities of labor and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country 
 a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it 
 should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm or afforded the facilities of credit 
 best suited to its practical needs watercourses undeveloped waste places unreclaimed forests untended 
 fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal un regarded waste heaps at every mine We have 
 studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production but we have not studied 
 cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry as statesmen or as individuals 
 Nor have we studied and perfected the   may be put at the service of humanity 
 in safeguarding the health of the Nation the health of its men and its women and its children as well as 
 their rights in the struggle for existence This is no sentimental duty The firm basis of government is justice 
 not pity These are matters of justice 
 There can be no equality or opportunity the first essential of justice in the body politic if men and women 
 and children be not shielded in their lives their very vitality from the consequences of great industrial and 
 social processes which they can not alter control or singly cope with Society must see to it that it does not 
 itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts The first duty of law is to keep sound the society 
 it serves Sanitary laws pure food laws and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are 
 powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency 
 These are some of the things we ought to do and not leave the others undone the old fashioned never to- 
 be neglected fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right This is the high enterprise of the 
 new day To lift everything that concerns our life as a Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of 
 every man 's conscience and vision of the right It is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans it is 
 inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste We shall restore not 
 destroy We shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified not as it might be if we 
 had a clean sheet of paper to write upon and   shall make it what it should be in the spirit of 
 those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge not shallow self satisfaction or the 
 excitement of excursions whither they can not tell Justice and only justice shall always be our motto 
 And yet it will be no cool process of mere science The Nation has been deeply stirred  
 passion   of wrong of ideals lost of government too often debauched and made an 
 instrument of evil The feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our 
 heartstrings like some air out of God 's own presence where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge 
 and the brother are one We know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us 
 through and through whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people whether we be 
 indeed their spokesmen and interpreters whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified 
 will to choose our high course of action

74,Barry Goldwater,Speech Accepting the Republican Presidential Nomination,1964," 
 
 
 My good friend and great Republican Dick Nixon and your charming wife Pat my running 
 mate that wonderful Republican who has served us so well for so long Bill Miller and his wife 
 Stephanie to Thurston Morton who 's done such a commendable job in chairmaning this 
 Convention to Mr. Herbert Hoover who I hope is watching and to that great American and 
 his wife General and Mrs. Eisenhower to my own wife my family and to all of my fellow 
 Republicans here assembled and Americans across this great Nation 
 From this moment united and determined we will go forward together dedicated to the 
 ultimate and undeniable greatness of the whole man Together we will win 
  
  
 
                   
 I accept your nomination with a deep sense of humility I accept too the responsibility that 
 goes with it and I seek your continued help and your continued guidance My fellow 
 Republicans our cause is too great for any man to feel worthy of it Our task would be too 
 great for any man did he not have with him the hearts and the hands of this great Republican 
 Party and I promise you tonight that every fiber of my being is consecrated to our cause that 
 nothing shall be lacking from the struggle that can be brought to  
 devotion and plain hard work 
 In this world no person no Party can guarantee anything but what we can do and what we 
 shall do is to deserve victory and victory will be ours 
 The good Lord raised this mighty Republic to be a home for the brave and to flourish as the 
 land of the free not to stagnate in the swampland of collectivism not to cringe before the 
 bullying of communism 
 Now my fellow Americans the tide has been running against freedom Our people have 
 followed false prophets We must and we shall return to proven ways not because they 
 are old but because they are true We must and we shall set the tides running again in the 
 cause of freedom And this party with its every action every word every breath and every 
 heartbeat has but a single resolve and that is freedom freedom made orderly for this 
  government freedom under a government   of 
 nature and of nature 's God freedom balanced so that order lacking liberty sic will not 
 become the slavery of the prison cell balanced so that liberty lacking order will not become 
 the license of the mob and of the jungle 
 Now we Americans understand freedom We have earned it we have lived for it and we 
 have died for it This Nation and its people are freedom 's model in a searching world We can 
 be freedom 's missionaries in a doubting world But ladies and gentlemen first we must renew 
 freedom 's mission in our own hearts and in our own homes 
 During four futile years the Administration which we shall replace has distorted and lost that 
 vision It has talked and talked and talked and talked the words of freedom but it has failed 
 and failed and failed in the works of freedom 
 Now failures cement the wall of shame in Berlin Failures blot the sands of shame at the Bay 
 of Pigs Failures mark the slow death of freedom in Laos Failures infest the jungles of 
 Vietnam And failures haunt the houses of our once great alliances and undermine the 
 greatest bulwark ever   the NATO community Failures proclaim lost 
  
  
 
                   
 leadership obscure purpose weakening will and the risk of inciting our sworn enemies to 
 new aggressions and to new excesses  
 And because of this Administration we are tonight a world divided we are a Nation becalmed 
 We have lost the brisk pace of diversity and the genius of individual creativity We are 
 plodding along at a pace red tape rules without responsibility 
 and regimentation without recourse 
 Rather than useful jobs in our country our people have been offered bureaucratic make 
 work rather than moral leadership they have been given bread and circuses They have 
 been given spectacles and yes they 've even been given scandals  
 Tonight there is violence in our streets corruption in our highest offices aimlessness 
 amongst our youth anxiety among our elders and there 's a virtual despair among the many 
 who look beyond material success for the inner meaning of their lives 
 And where examples of morality should be set the opposite is seen Small men seeking great 
 wealth or power have too often and too long turned even the highest levels of public service 
 into mere personal opportunity 
 Now certainly simple honesty is not too much to demand of men in government We find it in 
 most Republicans demand it from everyone They demand it from everyone no matter how 
 exalted or protected his position might be Now the growing menace in our country tonight to 
 personal safety to life to limb and property in homes in churches on the playgrounds and 
 places of business particularly in our great cities is the mounting concern or should be of 
 every thoughtful citizen in the United States 
 Security from domestic violence no less than from foreign aggression is the most elementary 
 and fundamental purpose of any government and a government that can not fulfill this 
 purpose is one that can not long command the loyalty of its citizens 
 History shows us it demonstrates that nothing nothing prepares the way for tyranny more 
 than the failure of public officials to keep the streets safe from bullies and marauders 
 Now we Republicans see all this as more much more than the result of mere political 
 differences or mere political mistakes We see this as the result of a fundamentally and 
 absolutely wrong view of man his nature and his destiny Those who seek to live your lives 
 for you to take your liberties in return for relieving you of yours those who elevate the state 
  
  
 
                   
 and downgrade the citizen must see ultimately a world in which earthly power can be 
 substituted for Divine Will and this Nation was founded upon the rejection of that notion and 
 upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom 
 Now those who seek absolute power even though they seek it to do what they regard as 
 good are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth And let 
 me remind you they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies Absolute 
 power does corrupt and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed Their 
 mistaken course stems from false notions ladies and gentlemen of equality Equality rightly 
 understood as our founding fathers understood it leads to liberty and to the emancipation of 
 creative differences Wrongly understood as it has been so tragically in our time it leads first 
 to conformity and then to despotism 
 Fellow Republicans it is the cause of Republicanism to resist concentrations of power private 
 or public which enforce such conformity and inflict such despotism It is the cause of 
 Republicanism to ensure that power remains in the hands of the people And so help us God 
 that is exactly what a Republican President will do with the help of a Republican Congress 
 It is further the cause of Republicanism to restore a clear understanding of the tyranny of man 
 over man in the world at large 
 It is our cause to dispel the foggy thinking which avoids hard decisions in the delusion that a 
 world of conflict will somehow mysteriously resolve itself into a world of harmony if we just 
 do n't rock the boat or irritate the forces of aggression and this is hogwash 
 It is further the cause of Republicanism to remind ourselves and the world that only the 
 strong can remain free that only the strong can keep the peace 
 Now I need n't remind you or my fellow Americans regardless of party that Republicans have 
 shouldered this hard responsibility and marched in this cause before It was Republican 
 leadership under Dwight Eisenhower that kept the peace and passed along to this 
 Administration the mightiest arsenal for defense the world has ever known And I need n't 
 remind you that it was the strength and the un]believable will of the Eisenhower years that 
 kept the    in the Formosa Straits and in Lebanon and 
 by showing it courageously at all times 
  
  
 
                   
 It was during those Republican years that the thrust of Communist imperialism was blunted It 
 was during those years of Republican leadership that this world moved closer not to war but 
 closer to peace than at any other time in the last three decades 
 And I need n't remind you but I will that it 's been during Democratic years that our 
 strength to deter war has stood still and even gone into a planned decline It has been during 
 Democratic years that we have weakly stumbled into conflict timidly refusing to draw our own 
 lines against aggression deceitfully refusing to tell even our people of our full participation 
 and tragically letting our finest men die on battlefields  by 
 pride or the prospect of victory 
 Yesterday it was Korea Tonight it is Vietnam Make no bones of this Do n't try to sweep this 
 under the rug We are at war in Vietnam And yet the President who is the Commander in- 
 Chief of our forces refuses to say mind you whether or not the objective over there is 
 victory And his Secretary of Defense continues to mislead and misinform the American 
 people and enough of it has gone by 
 And I need n't remind you but I will it has been during Democratic years that a billion 
 persons were cast into Communist captivity and their fate cynically sealed 
 Today in our beloved country we have an Administration which seems eager to deal with 
 communism in every coin known from gold to wheat from consulates to confidences and 
 even human freedom itself 
 Now the Republican cause demands that we brand communism as the principal disturber of 
 peace in the world today 
 Indeed we should brand it as the only significant disturber of the peace and we must make 
 clear that until its goals of conquest are absolutely renounced and its relations with all nations 
 tempered communism and the governments it now controls are enemies of every man on 
 earth who is or wants to be free 
 Now we here in America can keep the peace only if we remain vigilant and only if we remain 
 strong Only if we keep our eyes open and keep our guard up can we prevent war And I want 
 to make this abundantly clear I do n't intend to let peace or freedom be torn from our grasp 
 because of lack of strength or lack of will and that I promise you Americans 
  
  
 
                   
 I believe that we must look beyond the defense of freedom today to its extension tomorrow I 
 believe that the communism which boasts it will bury us will instead give way to the forces of 
 freedom And I can see in the distant and yet recognizable future the outlines of a world 
 worthy of our dedication our every risk our every effort our every sacrifice along the way 
 Yes a world that will redeem the suffering of those who will be liberated from tyranny I can 
 see and I suggest that all thoughtful men must contemplate the flowering of an Atlantic 
 civilization the whole of Europe reunified and freed trading openly across its borders 
 communicating openly across the world  
 Now this is a goal far far more meaningful than a moon shot 
 It 's a truly inspiring goal for all free men to set for themselves during the latter half of the 
 twentieth century  
 I can also see and all free men must thrill to the events of this Atlantic civilization joined 
 by its great ocean highway to the United States What a destiny What a destiny can be ours 
 to stand as a great central pillar linking Europe the Americas and the venerable and vital 
 peoples and cultures of the Pacific I can see a day when all the Americas North and South 
 will be linked in a mighty system a system in which the errors and misunderstandings of the 
 past will be submerged   a rising tide of prosperity and interdependence We 
 know that the misunderstandings of centuries are not to be wiped away in a day or wiped 
 away in an hour But we pledge   we pledge that human sympathy what our neighbors to 
 the South call an attitude of simpatico no less than enlightened self'-interest will be our 
 guide 
 And I can see this Atlantic civilization galvanizing and guiding emergent nations everywhere 
 Now I know this freedom is not the fruit of every soil I know that our own freedom was 
 achieved through  of brave and wise men And I know that 
 the road to freedom is a long and a challenging road And I know also that some men may 
 walk away from it that some men resist challenge accepting the false security of 
 governmental paternalism  
 And I pledge that the America I envision in the years ahead will extend its hand in health in 
 teaching and in cultivation so that all new nations will be at least encouraged to go our way 
 so that they will not wander down the dark alleys of tyranny or the dead end streets of 
 collectivism 
  
  
 
                   
 My fellow Republicans we do no man a 's light under a bushel of 
 mistaken humility  
 I seek an America proud of its past proud of its ways proud of its dreams and determined 
 actively to proclaim them But our example to the world must like charity begin at home  
 In our vision of a good and decent future free and peaceful there must be room room for 
 deliberation of the energy and the talent of the individual otherwise our vision is blind at the 
 outset  
 We must assure a society here which while never abandoning the needy or forsaking the 
 helpless nurtures incentives and opportunities for the creative and the productive We must 
 know the whole good is the product of many single contributions  
 And I cherish a day when our children once again will restore as heroes the sort of men and 
 women who unafraid and undaunted pursue the truth strive to cure disease subdue and 
 make fruitful our natural environment and produce the inventive engines of production 
 science and technology  
 This Nation whose creative people have enhanced this entire span of history should again 
 thrive upon the greatness of all those things which we we as individual citizens can and 
 should do And during Republican years this again will be a nation of men and women of 
 families proud of their role jealous of their responsibilities unlimited in their aspirations a 
 Nation where all who can will be self reliant  
 We Republicans see in our constitutional form of government the great framework which 
 assures the orderly but dynamic fulfillment of the whole man and we see the whole man as 
 the great reason for instituting orderly government in the first place  
 We see in private property and in economy based upon and fostering private property the 
 one way to make government a durable ally of the whole man rather than his determined 
 enemy We see in the sanctity of private property the only durable foundation for 
 constitutional government in a free society And beyond that we see in cherished diversity of 
 ways diversity of thoughts of motives and accomplishments We do n't seek to lead anyone 's 
 life for him We only seek to secure his rights guarantee him opportunity to strive with 
 government performing only those needed and constitutionally sanctioned tasks which can not 
 otherwise be performed  
  
  
 
                   
 We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities of maintaining 
 a stable monetary and fiscal climate encouraging a free and a competitive economy and 
 enforcing law and order Thus do we seek inventiveness diversity and creative difference 
 within a stable order for we Republicans define government 's role where needed at many 
 many levels preferably though the one closest to the people involved  
 Our towns and our cities then our counties then our states then our regional compacts 
 and only then the national government That let me remind you is the ladder of liberty built 
 by decentralized power On it also we must have balance between the branches of 
 government at every level  
 Balance diversity creative difference These are the elements of the Republican equation 
 Republicans agree heartily to disagree on many many of their applications but we have 
 never disagreed on the basic fundamental issues of why you and I are Republicans 
 This is a Party This Republican Party is a Party for free men not for blind followers and not 
 for conformists 
 In fact in 1858 Abraham Lincoln said this of the Republican party and I quote him because 
 he probably could have said it during the last week or so It was composed of strange 
 discordant and even hostile elements end of the quote in 1858 Yet all of these 
 elements agreed on one paramount objective To arrest the progress of slavery and place it 
 in the course of ultimate extinction 
 Today as then but more urgently and more broadly than then the task of preserving and 
 enlarging freedom at home and of safeguarding it from the forces of tyranny abroad is great 
 enough to challenge all our resources and to require all our strength 
 Anyone who joins us in all sincerity we welcome Those who do not care for our cause we 
 do n't expect to enter our ranks in any case And let our Republicanism so focused and so 
 dedicated not be made fuzzy and   stupid labels 
 I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice 
 And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue 
 
  
  
 
                   
 Why the beauty of the very system we Republicans are pledged to restore and revitalize the 
 beauty of this Federal system of ours is in its reconciliation of diversity with unity We must 
 not see malice in honest differences of opinion and no matter how great so long as they are 
 not inconsistent with the pledges we have given to each other in and through our Constitution 
 Our Republican cause is not to level out the world or make its people conform in computer 
 regimented sameness Our Republican cause is to free our people and light the way for liberty 
 throughout the world 
 Ours is a very human cause for very humane goals 
 This Party its good people and its unquenchable devotion to freedom will not fulfill the 
 purposes of this campaign which we launch here and now until our cause has won the day 
 inspired the world and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears 
 I repeat I accept your nomination with humbleness with pride and you and I are going to 
 fight for the goodness of our land  
 Thank you",0.0429219268262386,0.0294355731457471,0.1476171761751175,0.4632069170475006,0.2721990644931793,0.0386158786714077,0.0060034533962607,0.1896006846414454,0.5618268280632411,46.92501119820832,0.2980295566502463,0.009319181982914834,0.09665192672141504,0.044580419580419584,28.197080291970803,1.0
75,John F. Kennedy,Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation,1962," 
 
 
 Good evening my fellow citizens  
 This Government as promised has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military 
 buildup on the island of Cuba Within the past week unmistakable evidence has established 
 the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island 
 The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability 
 against the Western Hemisphere 
 Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last Tuesday morning at 9 
 A.M. I directed that our surveillance be stepped up And having now confirmed and completed 
 our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action this Government feels 
 obliged to report this new crisis to you in fullest detail 
 The characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types of installations 
 Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear 
 warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles Each of these missiles in short is 
 capable of striking Washington D. C. the Panama Canal Cape Canaveral Mexico City or any 
  
  
 
             
 other city in the southeastern part of the United States in Central America or in the 
 Caribbean area 
 Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range ballistic 
 missiles capable of traveling more than twice as far and thus capable of   striking most of 
 the major cities in the Western Hemisphere ranging as far north as Hudson Bay Canada and 
 as far south as Lima Peru In addition jet bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons are 
 now being uncrated and assembled in Cuba while the necessary air bases are being prepared 
 This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic  of 
 these large long range and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction 
 constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas in flagrant and 
 deliberate defiance of the Rio Pact of 1947 the traditions of this nation and hemisphere the 
 joint resolution of the 87th Congress the Charter of the United Nations and my own public 
 warnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13 This action also contradicts the repeated 
 assurances of Soviet spokesmen both publicly and privately delivered that the arms buildup 
 in Cuba would retain its original defensive character and that the Soviet Union had no need or 
 desire to station strategic missiles on the territory of any other nation 
 The size of this undertaking makes clear that it has been planned for some months Yet only 
 last month after I had made clear the distinction between any introduction of ground to- 
 ground missiles and the existence of defensive antiaircraft missiles the Soviet Government 
 publicly stated on September 11 that and I quote the armaments and military equipment 
 sent to Cuba are designed exclusively for defensive purposes that there is and I quote the 
 Soviet Government there is no need for the Soviet Government to shift its weapons for a 
 retaliatory blow to any other country for instance Cuba and that and I quote their 
 government the Soviet Union has so powerful rockets to carry these nuclear warheads that 
 there is no need to search for sites for them beyond the boundaries of the Soviet Union 
 That statement was false  
 Only last Thursday as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup was already in my hand Soviet 
 Foreign Minister Gromyko told me in my office that he was instructed to make it clear once 
 again as he said his government had already done that Soviet assistance to Cuba and I 
 quote pursued solely the purpose of contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba that 
 and I quote him of Cuban nationals in handling defensive 
 armaments   offensive and if it were otherwise Mr. Gromyko went on the 
 Soviet Government would never become involved in rendering such assistance 
  
  
 
             
 That statement also was false 
 
 Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate 
 deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation large or small We no 
 longer live in a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge 
 to a nation 's security to constitute maximum peril Nuclear weapons are so destructive and 
 ballistic missiles are so swift that any substantially increased possibility of their use or any 
 sudden change in their deployment may well be regarded as a definite threat to peace 
 For many years both the Soviet Union and the United States recognizing this fact have 
 deployed strategic nuclear weapons with great care never upsetting the precarious status quo 
 which insured that these weapons would not be used in the absence of some vital challenge 
 Our own strategic missiles have never been transferred to the territory of any other nation 
 under a cloak of secrecy and deception and our history unlike that of the Soviets since the 
 end of World War II demonstrates that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any other 
 nation or impose our system upon its people Nevertheless American citizens have become 
 adjusted to living daily on the bull's eye of Soviet missiles located inside the U.S.S.R. or in 
 submarines 
 In that sense missiles in Cuba add to an already clear and present danger although it 
 should be noted the nations of Latin America have never previously been subjected to a 
 potential nuclear threat But this secret swift extraordinary buildup of Communist missiles 
 in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the United States and the 
 nations of the Western Hemisphere in violation of Soviet assurances and in defiance of 
 American and hemispheric policy this sudden clandestine decision to station strategic 
 weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil is a deliberately provocative and unjustified 
 change in the status quo which can not be if our courage and our 
 commitments are ever to be trusted   or foe 
 The 1930 's taught us a clear lesson aggressive conduct if allowed to go unchecked and 
 unchallenged ultimately leads to war This nation is opposed to war We are also true to our 
 word Our unswerving objective therefore must be to prevent the use of these missiles 
 against this or any other country and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the 
 Western Hemisphere  
 Our policy has been one of patience and restraint as befits a peaceful and powerful nation 
 which leads a worldwide alliance We have been determined not to be diverted from our 
 central   and fanatics But now further action is required and it is 
  
  
 
             
 under way and these actions may only be the beginning We will not prematurely or 
 unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would 
 be ashes in our mouth but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be faced 
 Acting therefore in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western Hemisphere 
 and under the authority entrusted to   as   of 
 the Congress I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately  
 First To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment 
 under shipment to Cuba is being initiated All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever 
 nation or port will if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons be turned back This 
 quarantine will be extended if needed to other types of cargo and carriers We are not at this 
 time however denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin 
 blockade of 1948 
 Second I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its 
 military buildup The foreign ministers of the OAS Organization of American States in their 
 communiqué of October 6 rejected secrecy on such matters in this hemisphere Should these 
 offensive military preparations continue thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere further 
 action will be justified I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities and 
 I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban people and the Soviet technicians at the sites 
 the hazards to all concerned of continuing this threat will be recognized 
 Third It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba 
 against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an   Union on the United 
 States requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union 
 Fourth As a necessary military precaution I have reinforced our base at Guantanamo 
 evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there and ordered additional military units 
 to be on a standby alert basis 
 Fifth We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ[ization of Consultation 
 under the Organization of American States to consider this threat to hemispheric security and 
 to invoke articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty in support of all necessary action The United 
 Nations Charter allows for regional security arrangements and the nations of this hemisphere 
 decided long ago against the military presence of outside powers Our other allies around the 
 world have also been alerted 
  
  
 
             
 Sixth Under the Charter of the United Nations we are asking tonight that an emergency 
 meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest 
 Soviet threat to world peace Our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and 
 withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba under the supervision of U.N. observers before 
 the quarantine can be lifted 
 Seventh and finally I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine 
 reckless and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two 
 nations I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination and to join in an 
 historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man He has an 
 opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of   his 
 government 's own words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory and 
 withdrawing these weapons from   any action which will widen or 
 deepen the present crisis and   a search for peaceful and permanent 
 solutions 
 This nation is prepared to present its case against the Soviet threat to peace and our own 
 proposals for a peaceful world at any time and in any forum in the OAS in the United 
 Nations or in any other meeting that could be useful without limiting our freedom of action 
 We have in the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons We have 
 proposed the elimination of all arms and military bases in a fair and effective disarmament 
 treaty We are prepared to discuss new proposals for the removal of tensions on both sides 
 including the possibilities of a genuinely independent Cuba free to determine its own destiny 
 We have no wish to war with the Soviet Union for we are a peaceful people who desire to 
 live in peace with all other peoples 
 But it is difficult to settle or even discuss these problems in an atmosphere of intimidation 
 That is why this latest Soviet threat or any other threat which is made either independently 
 or in response to our actions this week-- must and will be met with determination Any hostile 
 move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are 
 committed including in particular the brave people of West Berlin will be met by whatever 
 action is needed 
 Finally I want to say a few words to the captive people of Cuba to whom this speech is being 
 directly   facilities I speak to you as a friend as one who knows of your 
 deep attachment to your fatherland as one who shares your aspirations for liberty and justice 
 for all And I have watched and the American people have watched with deep sorrow how 
 your nationalist revolution was betrayed and how your fatherland fell under foreign 
  
  
 
             
 domination Now your leaders are no longer Cuban leaders   They are 
 puppets and agents of an international conspiracy which has turned Cuba against your friends 
 and neighbors in the Americas and turned it into the first Latin American country to become a 
 target for nuclear war the first Latin American country to have these weapons on its soil 
 These new weapons are not in your interest They contribute nothing to your peace and well- 
 being They can only undermine it But this country has no wish to cause you to suffer or to 
 impose any system upon you We know that your lives and land are being used as pawns by 
 those who deny your freedom Many times in the past the Cuban people have risen to throw 
 out tyrants who destroyed their liberty And I have no doubt that most Cubans today look 
 forward to the time when they will be truly free free from foreign domination free to 
 choose their own leaders free to select their own system free to own their own land free to 
 speak and write and worship without fear or degradation And then shall Cuba be welcomed 
 back to the society of free nations and to the associations of this hemisphere 
 My fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we 
 have set out No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties 
 will be incurred Many months of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead months in which both 
 our patience and our will will be tested months in which many threats and denunciations will 
 keep us aware of our dangers But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing 
 The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are but it is the one 
 most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the 
 world The cost of freedom is always high but Americans have always paid it And one path 
 we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission 
 Our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of 
 freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere and we hope around the 
 world God willing that goal will be achieved

76,Ronald Reagan,Remarks on the 40th Anniversary of D Day,1984," 
 
 
 We 're here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this 
 continent to liberty For four long years much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow 
 Free nations had fallen Jews cried out in the camps millions cried out for liberation Europe 
 was enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue Here in Normandy the rescue began Here 
 the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human 
 history 
 We stand on a lonely windswept point on the northern shore of France The air is soft but 
 forty years ago at this moment the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men and the 
 air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon At dawn on the morning of the 
 6th of June 1944 two hundred and twenty five Rangers jumped off the British landing craft 
 and ran to the bottom of these cliffs  
 Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion to climb these sheer 
 and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns The Allies had been told that some of the 
 mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the 
 Allied advance 
  
  
 
                            
     
     
                         
 The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at 
 them with machine guns and throwing grenades And the American Rangers began to climb 
 They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up When 
 one Ranger fell another would take his place When one rope was cut a Ranger would grab 
 another and begin his climb again They climbed shot back and held their footing Soon one 
 by one the Rangers pulled themselves over the top and in seizing the firm land at the top of 
 these cliffs they began to seize back the continent of Europe Two hundred and twenty five 
 came here After two days of fighting only ninety could still bear arms 
 And behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the 
 top of these cliffs And before me are the men who put them there These are the boys of 
 Pointe du Hoc These are the men who took the cliffs These are the champions who helped 
 free a continent And these are the heroes who helped end a war Gentlemen I look at you 
 and I think of the words of Stephen Spender 's poem You are men who in your lives fought 
 for life and left the vivid air signed with your honor  
 I think I know what you may be thinking right now thinking we were just part of a bigger 
 effort everyone was brave that day Well everyone was Do you remember the story of Bill 
 Millin of the 51st Highlanders Forty years ago today British troops were pinned down near a 
 bridge waiting desperately for help Suddenly they heard the sound of bagpipes and some 
 thought they were dreaming Well they were n't They looked up and saw Bill Millin with his 
 bagpipes leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground 
 around him  
 Lord Lovat was with him Lord Lovat of Scotland who calmly announced when he got to the 
 bridge Sorry I 'm a few minutes late as if he 'd been   jam when in truth 
 he 'd just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach which he and his men had just 
 taken  
 There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and 
 the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold and the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians 
 who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast They knew what awaited them there 
 but they would not be deterred And once they hit Juno Beach they never looked back 
 All of these men were part of a roll call of honor with names that spoke of a pride as bright as 
 the colors they bore The Royal Winnipeg Rifles Poland 's 24th Lancers the Royal Scots 
 Fusiliers the Screaming Eagles the Yeomen of England 's armored divisions the forces of Free 
 France the Coast Guard 's Matchbox Fleet and you the American Rangers 
  
  
 
                            
     
     
                         
 Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here You were young the day 
 you took these cliffs some of you were hardly more than boys with the deepest joys of life 
 before you Yet you risked everything here Why Why did you do it What impelled you to 
 put aside the instinct for self preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs What 
 inspired all the men of the armies that met here We look at you and somehow we know the 
 answer It was faith and belief It was loyalty and love 
 The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right faith that they fought 
 for all humanity faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the 
 next It was the deep knowledge and pray God we have not lost it that there is a 
 profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for 
 conquest You were here to liberate not to conquer and so you and those others did not 
 doubt your cause And you were right not to doubt 
 You all knew that some things are worth dying for One 's country is worth dying for and 
 democracy is worth dying for because it 's the most deeply honorable form of government 
 ever  of you loved liberty All of you were willing to fight tyranny and you 
 knew the people of your countries were behind you 
 The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading 
 through the darkness back home They fought or felt in their hearts though they could n't 
 know in fact that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4:00 am In Kansas they were 
 kneeling on their porches and praying And in Philadelphia they were ringing the Liberty Bell 
 Something else helped the men of D day their rock hard belief that Providence would have a 
 great hand in the events that would unfold here that God was an ally in this great cause And 
 so the night before the invasion when Colonel Wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel 
 with him in prayer he told them Do not bow your heads but look up so you can see God 
 and ask His blessing in what we 're about to do Also that night General Matthew Ridgway on 
 his cot listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua I will not fail thee nor 
 forsake thee 
 These are the things that impelled them these are the things that shaped the unity of the 
 Allies 
 When the war was over there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the 
 people There were nations to be reborn Above all there was a new peace to be assured 
 These were huge and daunting tasks But the Allies summoned strength from the faith belief 
  
  
 
                            
     
     
                         
 loyalty and love of those who fell here They rebuilt a new Europe together There was first a 
 great reconciliation among those who had been enemies all of whom had suffered so greatly 
 The United States did its part creating the Marshall Plan to help rebuild our allies and our 
 former enemies The Marshall Plan led to the Atlantic alliance a great alliance that serves to 
 this day as our shield for freedom for prosperity and for peace 
 In spite of our great efforts and successes not all that followed the end of the war was happy 
 or planned Some liberated countries were lost The great sadness of this loss echoes down to 
 our own time in the streets of Warsaw Prague and East Berlin The Soviet troops that came 
 to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came They 're still there uninvited 
 unwanted unyielding almost forty years after the war Because of this allied forces still 
 stand on this continent Today as forty years ago our armies are here for only one purpose 
 to protect and defend democracy The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and 
 graveyards where our heroes rest 
 We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars It is better to be here ready 
 to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea rushing to respond only after 
 freedom is lost We 've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable 
 response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent But we try always to be 
 prepared for peace prepared to deter aggression prepared to negotiate the reduction of 
 arms and yes prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation In truth there is no 
 reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union so 
 together we can lessen the risks of war now and forever 
 It 's fitting to remember here the great losses also   people during World 
 War II Twenty million perished a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of 
 ending war I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war We want 
 to wipe from the face of the earth the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands And I 
 tell you we are ready to seize that beachhead We look for some sign from the Soviet Union 
 that they are willing to move forward that they share our desire and love for peace and that 
 they will give up the ways of conquest There must be a changing there that will allow us to 
 turn our hope into action 
 We will pray forever that someday that changing will come But for now particularly today it 
 is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other to our freedom and to the 
 alliance that protects it 
  
  
 
                            
     
     
                         
 We 're bound   us 40 years ago the same loyalties traditions and beliefs 
 We 're  strength of America 's allies is vital to the United States and the 
 American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe 's democracies 
 We were with you then we 're with you now Your hopes are our hopes and your destiny is 
 our destiny 
 Here in this place where the West held together let us make a vow to our dead Let us show 
  that we understand what they died for Let our actions say to them the 
 words for which Matthew Ridgway listened I will not fail thee nor forsake thee 
  and   valor and borne by their 
 memory let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died

78,Abraham Lincoln,First Inaugural Address,1861," Fellow citizens of the United States In compliance with a custom as old as the government 
 itself I appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath 
  of the United States to be   before he 
 enters on the execution of his office 
 I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration 
 about which there is no special anxiety or excitement 
 Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States 
 of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be 
 endangered There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension Indeed 
 the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their 
 inspection It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you I 
 do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that I have no purpose directly or 
 indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists I believe I 
 have no lawful right to do so and I have no inclination to do so Those who nominated and 
 elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations 
 and had never recanted them And more than this they placed in the platform for my 
 acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which 
 I now read 
 Resolved That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States and especially the right 
 of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own 
 judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and 
 endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed 
 force of the soil of any State or Territory no matter under what pretext as among the 
 gravest of crimes 
 I now reiterate these sentiments and in doing so I only press upon the public attention 
 the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property peace and 
 security of no section are to be in any wise   incoming administration 
 I add too that all the protection which consistently with the Constitution and the laws can 
 be given will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded for whatever 
 cause as cheerfully to one section as to another 
 There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor The 
 clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions 
 No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof escaping into 
 another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such 
 service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or 
 labor may be due 
 It is scarcely questioned that this provision was   made it for the 
 reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law All 
 members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution to this provision as 
 much as to any other To the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the 
 terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous Now if they would 
 make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass 
 a   which to keep good that unanimous oath 
 There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be   by 
 State authority but surely that difference is not a very material one If the slave is to be 
 surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to   it is 
 done And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely 
 unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept 
 Again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized 
 and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case 
 surrendered as a slave And might it not be well at the same time to   the 
 enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each 
 State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States 
 I take the official oath to day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe 
 the Constitution or   rules And while I do not choose now to specify 
 particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced I do suggest that it will be much safer 
 for all both in official and private stations to conform to and   acts which 
 stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held 
 to be unconstitutional 
 It is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a President under our National 
 Constitution During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in 
 succession administered the executive branch of the government They have conducted it 
 through many perils and generally with great success Yet with all this scope of precedent 
 I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great 
 and peculiar difficulty A disruption of the Federal Union heretofore only menaced is now 
 formidably attempted 
 I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these 
 States is perpetual Perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all 
 national governments It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in 
 its organic law for its own termination Continue to execute all the express provisions of our 
 National Constitution and the Union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it 
  not provided for in the instrument itself 
 Again if the United States be not a government proper but an association of States in the 
 nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably   all the 
 parties who made it One party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but 
 does it not require all to lawfully rescind it 
 Descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal 
 contemplation the Union is perpetual   of the Union itself The Union 
 is much older than the Constitution It was formed in  of Association in 
 1774 It was matured and   of Independence in 1776 It was 
 further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged 
 that it should be  of Confederation in 1778 And finally in 1787 
 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a 
 more perfect Union 
 But if the destruction of the   by a part only of the States be lawfully 
 possible the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution having lost the vital element 
 of perpetuity 
 It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of 
 the Union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of 
 violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are 
 insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances 
 I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the Union is unbroken 
 and to the extent of my ability I shall take care as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins 
 upon me that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States Doing this I 
 deem to be only a simple duty on my part and I shall perform it so far as practicable 
 unless my rightful masters the American people shall withhold the requisite means or in 
 some authoritative manner direct the contrary I trust this will not be regarded as a menace 
 but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and 
 maintain itself 
 In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it 
 be forced upon the national authority The power confided to me will be used to hold 
 occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect 
 the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be 
 no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere Where hostility to the 
 United States in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent 
 competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices there will be no attempt to 
 force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object While the strict legal right may 
 exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would 
 be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that I deem it better to forego for the 
 time the uses of such offices 
 The mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union So far as 
 possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most 
 favorable to calm thought and reflection The course here indicated will be followed unless 
 current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in 
 every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances 
 actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles 
 and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections 
 That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all 
 events and are glad of any pretext to do it I will neither affirm nor deny but if there be 
 such I need address no word to them To those however who really love the Union may I 
 not speak 
 Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its 
 benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do 
 it Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the 
 ills you fly from have no real existence Will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater 
 than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake 
 All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained Is it true 
 then that any right plainly written in the Constitution has been denied I think not 
 Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing 
 this Think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the 
 Constitution has ever been denied   force of numbers a majority should 
 deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of 
 view justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one But such is not our 
 case All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by 
 affirmations and negations guarantees and prohibitions in the Constitution that 
 controversies never arise concerning them But no organic law can ever be framed with a 
 provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical 
 administration No foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain 
 express provisions for all possible questions Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by 
 national The Constitution does not expressly say May Congress 
 prohibit slavery in the Territories The Constitution does not expressly say Must Congress 
 protect slavery in the Territories The Constitution does not expressly say 
 From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon 
 them into majorities and minorities If the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or 
 the government must cease There is no other alternative for continuing the government is 
 acquiescence on one side or the other 
 If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in 
 turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a 
 majority refuses to be   For instance why may not any portion of 
 a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the 
 present Union now claim to secede from it All who cherish disunion sentiments are now 
 being educated to the exact temper of doing this 
 Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new Union as to 
 produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession 
 Plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy A majority held in restraint 
 by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes 
 of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people Whoever 
 rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism Unanimity is impossible the 
 rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible so that rejecting 
 the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left 
 I do not forget the position  constitutional questions are to be 
  Court nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any 
 case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitled to 
 very high respect and consideration in all parallel   departments of the 
 government And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any 
 given case still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case with the 
 chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases can better 
 be borne than could the evils of a different practice At the same time the candid citizen 
 must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole 
 people is to be irrevocably   the Supreme Court the instant they are 
 made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased 
 to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the 
 hands of that eminent tribunal Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the 
 judges It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before 
 them and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes 
 One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the 
 other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended This is the only substantial 
 dispute The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the 
 foreign slave trade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a 
 community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself The 
 great body of the people   legal obligation in both cases and a few break 
 over in each This I think can not be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases 
 after the separation of the sections than before The foreign slave trade now imperfectly 
 suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive 
 slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at 
 Physically speaking we can not separate We can not remove our respective sections from 
 each other nor build an impassable wall between them A husband and wife may be 
 divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different 
 parts of our country can not do this They can not but remain face to face and intercourse 
 either amicable or hostile must continue between them Is it possible then to make that 
 intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before Can 
 aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws Can treaties be more faithfully 
 enforced between aliens than laws can among friends Suppose you go to war you can not 
 fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease 
 fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you 
 This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it Whenever they shall 
 grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of 
 amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it I can not be ignorant 
 of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the National 
 Constitution amended While I make no recommendation of amendments I fully recognize 
 the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the 
 modes prescribed in the instrument itself and I should under existing circumstances favor 
 rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it 
 I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable in that it allows 
 amendments to originate with the people themselves instead of only permitting them to 
 take or reject propositions   especially chosen for the purpose and 
 which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse I 
 understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution which amendment however I 
 have not seen has passed Congress to the effect that the Federal Government shall 
 never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States including that of persons held to 
 service To avoid misconstruction of what I have said I depart from my purpose not to 
 speak of particular amendments so far as to say that holding such a provision to now be 
 implied constitutional law I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable 
 The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people and they have conferred none 
 upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States The people themselves can do this 
 also if they choose but the executive as such has nothing to do with it His duty is to 
 administer the present government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired 
 by him to his successor 
 Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people Is there 
 any better or equal hope in the world In our present differences is either party without 
 faith of being in the right If the Almighty Ruler of Nations with his eternal truth and 
 justice be on your side of the North or on yours of the South that truth and that justice 
 will surely   of this great tribunal of the American people 
 By the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely given 
 their public servants but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provided for 
 the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals While the people retain 
 their virtue and vigilance no  of wickedness or folly can very 
 seriously injure the government in the short space of four years 
 My countrymen one and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject Nothing 
 valuable can be   If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to 
 a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be 
 but no good object can be  of you as are now dissatisfied still have the 
 old Constitution unimpaired and on the sensitive point the laws of your own framing under 
 it while the new administration will have no immediate power if it would to change either 
 If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute there still 
 is no single good reason for precipitate action Intelligence patriotism Christianity and a 
 firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to 
 adjust in the best way all our present difficulty 
 In your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue 
 of civil war The government will not assail you You can have no conflict without being 
 yourselves the aggressors You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the 
 government while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it 
 I am loath to close We are not enemies but friends We must not be enemies Though 
 passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection The mystic chords of 
 memory stretching from every battle field and patriot grave to every living heart and 
 hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again 
 touched as surely they will  angels of our nature",0.0154766580089926,0.0052284533157944,0.6169381737709045,0.3152248561382293,0.0352274440228939,0.01003582123667,0.0018686519470065,0.1472910030221351,0.4944812511911565,35.93836403759562,0.2766364070711897,0.003063869903370257,0.06069895769466585,0.04186413902053712,31.902255639097746,0.0
79,Aaron Swartz,Address at F2C Freedom to Connect Conference,2012," 
 
 
 So for me it all started with a phone call It was September not last year but the year before 
 that September 2010 and I got a phone call from my friend Peter 
 Aaron he said there 's an amazing bill that you have to take a look at 
 Well what is it I said 
 It 's called COICA   The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeit Act 
 Peter I said I do n't care about copyright law Maybe you 're right Maybe Hollywood is 
 right But either way what 's the big deal I 'm not gon na waste my life fighting over a little 
 issue like copyright Health Care Financial Reform those are the issues that I work on not 
 something obscure like copyright law 
 I could hear Peter grumbling in the background 
 Look I do n't have the time to argue with you he said but it does n't matter for right now 
 because this is n't a bill about copyright 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 It 's not  
 No he said It 's a bill about the freedom to connect 
 Now I was listening Peter explained what you ’ve all probably long since learned that this bill 
 would let the government devise a list of websites that Americans were n’t allowed to visit On 
 the next day I came up with lots of ways to try to explain this to people   I said it was a great 
 firewall of America I said it was an Internet blacklist   I said it was online censorship   But I 
 think it ’s worth taking a step back putting aside all the rhetoric and just thinking for a 
 moment about how radical this bill really was 
 Sure there are lots of times when the government makes rules about speech If you slander a 
 private figure if you buy a television ad that lies to people if you have a wild party that plays 
 booming music all night In all these cases the government can come stop you But this was 
 something radically different It was n’t that the government went to people and asked them 
 to take down particular material that was illegal It shut down whole websites Essentially it 
 stopped Americans from communicating entirely with certain groups 
 There ’s nothing really like it in U.S. law   If you play loud music all night the government 
 does n’t slap you with an order requiring you be mute for the next couple weeks They do n’t 
 say nobody can make any more noise inside your house There ’s a specific complaint which 
 they ask you to specifically remedy and then your life goes on   The closet example I could 
 find was a case where the government was at war with an adult bookstore The place kept 
 selling pornography the government kept getting the porn declared illegal and then 
 frustrated they decided to shut the whole bookstore down But even that was eventually 
 declared unconstitutional a violation of the First Amendment 
 So you might say surely COICA would get declared unconstitutional as well   But I knew that 
 the Supreme Court had a blind spot around the First Amendment more than anything else 
 more than slander or libel more than pornography more even than even child pornography 
 Their blind spot was copyright When it came to copyright it was like part of the justices 
 brains shut off and they just totally forgot about the First Amendment You got the sense that 
 deep down they did n’t even think the First Amendment applied when copyright was at issue 
 Which means that if you did want to censor the Internet if you wanted to come up with some 
 way that the government could shut down access to particular websites this bill might be the 
 only way to do it   If it was about pornography it probably would get overturned by courts 
 just like the adult bookstore case But if you claimed it was about copyright it might just 
 sneak through 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 And that was especially terrifying because as you know copyright is everywhere If you want 
 to shut down WikiLeaks it ’s a bit of stretch to claim that you ’re doing it because they have 
 too much pornography But it ’s not hard at all to claim that WikiLeaks is violating copyright 
 because everything is copyrighted   This speech you know the thing I am giving right now 
 these words are copyrighted   And it ’s so easy to accidently copy something So easy in fact 
 that the leading Republican supporter of COICA Orrin Hatch had illegally copied a bunch of 
 code into his own Senate website So if even Orrin Hatch‘s Senate website was found to be 
 violating copyright law what ’s the chance that they would n’t find something they could pin on 
 any of us 
 There ’s a battle going on right now a battle to define everything that happens on the Internet 
 in terms of traditional things that the law understands Is sharing a video on BitTorrent like 
 shoplifting from a movie store or is it like loaning a videotape to a friend Is reloading a 
 webpage over and over again like a peaceful virtual sit in or a violent smashing of shop 
 windows Is the freedom to connect like freedom of speech or like the freedom to murder 
 This bill would be a huge potentially permanent loss If we lost the ability to communicate 
 with each other over the Internet it would be a change to the Bill of Rights the freedoms 
 guaranteed in our Constitution The freedoms our country had been built on would be 
 suddenly deleted New technology instead of bringing us greater freedom would have 
 snuffed out fundamental rights we ’d always taken for granted And I realized that day talking 
 to Peter that I could n’t let that happen 
 But it was going to happen The bill COICA was introduced on September 20 2010 a 
 Monday And in the press release heralding the introduction of this bill way at the bottom it 
 was scheduled for a vote on September 23 just three days later And while of course there 
 had to be a vote you ca n’t pass a bill without a vote the results of that vote were already 
 a foregone conclusion   Because if you looked at the introduction of the law it was n’t just 
  eccentric member of Congress it was   of the 
 Judiciary Committee and co- the other members Republicans and 
 Democrats So yes there ’d be a vote but it would n’t be much of a surprise because nearly 
 everyone who was voting had signed their name to the bill before it was even introduced 
 Now I ca n’t stress how unusual this is this is emphatically not how Congress works I ’m 
 I ’m not talking about how Congress should work the way you see on Schoolhouse Rock   I 
 mean this is not the way Congress actually works   I mean I think we all know Congress is a 
 dead zone of deadlock and dysfunction   There are months of debates and horse trading and 
 hearings and stall tactics I mean you know first you ’re supposed to announce that you ’re 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 gon na hold hearings on a problem and then days of experts talking about the issue and then 
 you propose a possible solution you bring the experts back for their thoughts on that And 
 then other members have different solutions and they propose those and you spend a bunch 
 of time debating and there ’s a bunch of trading to get members over to your cause and finally 
 you spend hours talking one on one with the different people in the debate try and come 
 back with some sort of compromise which you hash out in endless backroom meetings And 
 then when that ’s all done you take that and you go through it   public to see if 
 anyone has any objections or wants to make any changes and then you have the vote It is a 
 painful arduous process   You do n’t just introduce a bill on Monday and then pass it 
 unanimously a couple days later That just does n’t happen in Congress 
 But this time it was going to happen And it was n’t because there were no disagreements on 
 the issue there are always disagreements Some senators thought the bill was much too 
 weak and needed to be stronger As it was introduced the bill only allowed the government to 
 shut down websites and these senators they wanted any company in the world to have the 
 power to get a website shut down Other senators thought it was a drop too strong But 
 somehow in the kind of thing you never see in Washington they ’d all managed to put their 
 personal differences aside to come together and support one bill they were persuaded they 
 could all live with a bill that would censor the Internet And when I saw this I realized 
 whoever was behind this was good  
 Now the typical way you make good things happen in Washington is you find a bunch of 
 wealthy companies who agree with you   Social security did n’t get passed because some brave 
 politicians decided their good conscience could n’t possibly let old people die starving in the 
 streets I mean are you kidding me Social security got passed because John D. Rockefeller 
 was sick of having to take money out of his profits to pay for his workers pension funds Why 
 do that when you can just let the government take money from the workers Now my point is 
 not that social security is a bad thing I think it ’s fantastic It ’s just that the way you get the 
 government to do fantastic things is you find a big company willing to back them The 
 problem is of course that big companies are n’t really huge fans of civil liberties You know 
 it ’s it ’s not that they ’re against them it ’s just that there ’s not much money in it  
 Now if you ’ve been reading the press you probably did n’t hear this part of the story   As 
 Hollywood has been telling it the great good copyright bill that they were pushing was 
  Internet companies who make millions of dollars off of copyright 
 infringement But it just it really was n’t true I mean I was in there in the meetings with 
 the Internet companies actually you ’re probably all here today And you know if all their 
 profits depended on copyright infringement they would have put a lot more money into 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 changing copyright law The fact is the big Internet companies they would do just fine if this 
 bill passed I mean they would n’t be thrilled about it but I doubt they would have even have a 
 noticeable dip in their stock price 
 So they were against it but they were against it like the rest of us on grounds primarily of 
 principle and principle does n’t have a lot of money in the budget to spend on lobbyists So 
 they were practical about it Look they said this bill is going to pass in fact it ’s probably 
 gon na pass unanimously and as much as we try this is not a train we ’re going to be able to 
 stop So were not gon na support it We could n’t support it but in opposition let ’s just try and 
 make it better So that was the strategy Lobby to make the bill better They had lists of 
 changes that would make the bill less obnoxious or less expensive for them or whatever But 
 the fact remained at the end of the day it was going to be a bill that was gon na censor the 
 Internet and there was nothing we could do to stop it 
 So I did what you always do when you ’re a little guy facing a terrible future with long odds 
 and little hope of success I started an online petition I called all my friends and we stayed 
 up all night setting up a website for this new group Demand Progress with an online petition 
 opposing this noxious bill and I sent it to a few friends Now I ’ve done a few online petitions 
 before I ’ve worked at some of the biggest groups in the world that do online petitions I ’ve 
 written a ton of them and read even more But I ’ve never seen anything like this Starting 
 from literally nothing we went to 10,000 signers then 100,000 signers and then 200,000 
 signers and 300,000 signers in just a couple of weeks And it was n’t just signing a name We 
 asked those people to call Congress to call urgently There was a vote coming up this week 
 in just a couple days and we had to stop it And at the same time we told the press about it 
 about this incredible online petition that was taking off And we met with the staff of members 
 of Congress and pleaded with them to withdraw their support for the bill I mean it was 
 amazing It was huge The power of the Internet rose up in force against this bill And then it 
 passed unanimously 
 Now to be fair several of the members gave nice speeches before casting their vote and in 
 their speeches they said their office had been overwhelmed with comments about the First 
 Amendment concerns behind this bill comments that had them very worried So worried in 
 fact they were n’t sure that they still supported the bill But even though they did n’t support 
 it they were gon na vote for it anyway they said because they needed to keep the process 
 moving and they were sure any problems that were had with it could be fixed later So I ’m 
 gon na ask you does this sound like Washington D.C. to you Since when do members of 
 Congress vote for things that they oppose just to keep the process moving I mean whoever 
 was behind this was good 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 And then suddenly the process stopped Senator Ron Wyden the Democrat from Oregon 
 put a hold on the bill Giving a speech in which he called it a nuclear bunker buster bomb 
 aimed at the Internet he announced he would not allow it to pass without changes And as 
 you may know a single senator ca n’t actually stop a  they can delay it 
 By objecting to a bill they can demand Congress spend a bunch of time debating it before 
 getting it passed And Senator Wyden did He bought us time a lot of time as it turned out 
 His delay held all the way through the end of that session of Congress so that when the bill 
 came back it had to start all over again And since they were starting all over again they 
 figured why not give it a new name And that ’s when it began being called PIPA and 
 eventually SOPA 
 So there was probably a year or two of delay there And in retrospect we used that time to 
 lay the groundwork for what came later But that ’s not what it felt like at the time At the 
 time it felt like we were going around telling people that these bills were awful and in return 
 they told us that they thought we were crazy I mean we were kids wandering around waving 
 our arms about how the government was gon na censor the Internet It does sound a little 
 crazy You can ask Larry tomorrow I was constantly telling him what was going on trying to 
 get him involved and I ’m pretty sure he just thought I was exaggerating Even I began to 
 doubt myself It It was a rough period But when the bill came back and started moving 
 again suddenly all the work we had done started coming together All the folks we talked to 
 about it suddenly began getting really involved and getting others involved Everything 
 started snowballing It happened so fast 
 I I remember there was one week where I was having dinner with a friend in the 
 technology industry and he asked what I worked on and I told him about this bill And he 
 said Wow You need to tell people about that And I I just groaned And then just a few 
 weeks later I remember I was chatting with this cute girl on the subway and she was n’t in 
 technology at all but when she heard that I was she turned to me very seriously and said 
 You know we have to stop SOAP So progress right 
 But I think that story illustrates what happened during those couple weeks because the 
 reason we won was n’t because I was working on it or Reddit was working on it or Google was 
 working on it or Tumblr or any other particular person It was because there was this 
 enormous mental shift in our industry Everyone was thinking of ways they could help often 
 really clever ingenious ways People made videos They made infographics They started 
 PACs They designed ads They bought billboards They wrote news stories They held 
 meetings Everybody saw it as their responsibility to help I remember at one point during this 
 period I held a meeting with a bunch of startups in New York trying to encourage everyone to 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 get involved and I felt a bit like I was hosting one of these Clinton Global Initiative meetings 
 where I got to turn to every startup in the every startup founder in the room and be like 
 What are you going to do And what are you going to do And everyone was trying to 
 one up each other 
 If there was one day the shift crystallized I think it was the day of the hearings on SOPA in 
 the House the day we got that phrase It ’s no longer OK not to understand how the Internet 
 works There was just something about watching those clueless members of Congress debate 
 the bill watching them insist they could regulate the Internet and a bunch of nerds could n’t 
 possibly stop them They really brought it home for people that this was happening that 
 Congress was going to break the Internet and it just did n’t care 
 I remember when this moment first hit me I was at an event and I was talking and I got 
 introduced to a U.S. senator one of the strongest proponents of the original COICA bill in 
 fact And I asked him why despite being such a progressive despite giving a speech in favor 
 of civil liberties why he was supporting a bill that would censor the Internet And you know 
 that typical politician smile he had suddenly faded from his face and his eyes started burning 
 this fiery red And he started shouting at me said Those people on the Internet they think 
 they can get away with anything They think they can just put anything up there and there ’s 
 nothing we can do to stop them They put up everything They They put up our nuclear 
 missiles and they just laugh at us Well we ’re gon na show them There ’s got to be laws on 
 the Internet It ’s got to be under control 
 Now as far as I know nobody has ever put up the U.S. 's nuclear missiles on the Internet I 
 mean it 's not something I ’ve heard about But that ’s sort of the point He was n’t having a 
 rational concern right It was this irrational fear that things were out of control Here was this 
 man a United States senator and those people on the Internet they were just mocking him 
 They had to be brought under control Things had to be under control And I think that was 
 the attitude of Congress And just as seeing that fire in that senator ’s eyes scared me I think 
 those hearings scared a lot of people They saw this was n’t the attitude of a thoughtful 
 government trying to resolve trade offs in order to best represent its citizens This was more 
 like the attitude of a tyrant And so the citizens fought back 
 The wheels came off the bus pretty quickly after that hearing First the Republican senators 
 pulled out and then the White House issued a statement opposing the bill and then the 
 Democrats left all alone out there announced they were putting the bill on hold so they could 
 have a few further discussions before the official vote And that was when as hard as it was 
 for me to believe after all this we had won The thing that everyone said was impossible 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 that some of the biggest companies in the world had written off as kind of a pipe dream had 
 happened We did it We won 
 And then we started rubbing it in You all know what happened next Wikipedia went black 
 Reddit went black Craigslist went black The phone lines on Capitol Hill flat out melted 
 Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting their support for the bill 
 that they were promoting just a couple days ago And it was just ridiculous I mean there ’s a 
 chart from the time that captures it pretty well It says something like January 14th on one 
 side and has this big long list of names supporting the bill and then just a few lonely people 
 opposing it and on the other side it says January 15th and now it ’s totally reversed 
 everyone is opposing it just a few lonely names still hanging on in support 
 I mean this really was unprecedented Do n’t take my word for it but ask former Senator 
 Chris Dodd now the chief lobbyist for Hollywood He admitted after he lost that he had 
 masterminded the whole evil plan And he told The New York Times he had never seen 
 anything like it during his many years in Congress And everyone I ’ve spoken to agrees The 
 people rose up and they caused a sea change in Washington not the press which refused 
 to cover the story just coincidentally their parent companies all happened to be lobbying 
 for the bill not the politicians who were pretty much unanimously in favor of it and not the 
 companies who had all but given up trying to stop it and decided it was inevitable 
 It was really the people themselves They killed the bill dead so dead 
 that when members of Congress propose something now that even touches the Internet they 
 have to give a long speech beforehand about how it is definitely not like SOPA so dead that 
 when you ask Congressional staffers about it they groan and shake their heads like it ’s all a 
 bad dream they ’re trying really hard to forget so dead that it ’s kind of hard to believe this 
 story hard to remember how close it all came to actually passing hard to remember how this 
 could have gone any other way But it was n’t a dream or a nightmare it was all very real 
 And it will happen again Sure it will have yet another name and maybe a different excuse 
 and probably do its damage in a different way But make no mistake The enemies of the 
 freedom to connect have not disappeared The fire in those politicians eyes has n’t been put 
 out There are a lot of people a lot of powerful people who want to clamp down on the 
 Internet And to be honest there are n’t a whole lot who have a vested interest in protecting it 
 from all of that Even some of the biggest companies some of the biggest Internet 
 companies to put it frankly would benefit from a world in which their little competitors could 
 get censored We ca n’t let that happen 
  
  
 
             
         
         
                 
        
                  
          
          
                                                                          
 Now I ’ve told this as a personal story partly because I think big stories like this one are just 
 more interesting at human scale The director J.D. Walsh says good stories should be like the 
 poster for Transformers There ’s a huge evil robot on the left side of the poster and a huge 
 big army on the right side of the poster And in the middle at the bottom there ’s just a small 
 family trapped in the middle Big stories need human stakes 
 But mostly it ’s a personal story because I did n’t have time to research any of the other part 
 of it But that ’s kind of the point We won this fight because everyone made themselves the 
 hero of their own story Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom They threw 
 themselves into it They did whatever they could think of to do They did n’t stop to ask 
 anyone for permission You remember how Hacker News readers spontaneously organized this 
 boycott of GoDaddy over their support of SOPA Nobody told them they could do that A few 
 people even thought it was a bad idea It did n’t matter 
 The senators were right The Internet really is out of control But if we forget that if we let 
 Hollywood rewrite the story so it was just big company Google who stopped the bill if we let 
 them persuade us we did n’t actually make a difference if we start seeing it as someone else ’s 
 responsibility to do this work and it ’s our job just to go home and pop some popcorn and curl 
 up on the couch to watch Transformers well then next time they might just win 
 Let ’s not let that happen",0.1279730051755905,0.0698479637503624,0.2910354137420654,0.0246942825615406,0.3569770157337188,0.046925239264965,0.0825470685958862,0.0645267355999264,0.5370594317962741,69.77735515569171,0.204828660436137,0.009807692307692307,0.07597535934291581,0.035252901248084084,19.92337164750958,0.0
80,Maciej Ceglowski,Opening Statement to the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Privacy Rights and Data Collection in a Digital Economy,2019," Thank you Chairman Crapo and to the committee for inviting me to speak today 
 My name is Maciej Ceglowski I run a small online business called Pinboard and I 
 operate what in Silicon Valley is considered an extremely exotic business model I 
 take a small amount of money 11 dollars a year for a useful service 
 As you know in my world the economic basis of the Internet is mass surveillance 
 We all have some sense of the extent to which our behavior is being constantly 
 monitored not just the data we provide to the services that we use but the 
 observations that computers make about us in every aspect of private and public 
 life 
 This data is simply not regulated As a tech person I 'm not used to wearing a 
 necktie Putting mine on this morning I saw that there was a small tag on the 
 back of it I realized that my necktie is better regulated than my entire industry 
 We collect this data we have no transparency in what we do with it and we are 
 simply deceiving the American people because as a technologist I know that 
 we lack the technical capacity to keep large collections of user data safe over time 
 And I think you 've seen in the news the litany of data breaches year after year 
 time after time whether from industry or from government It is simply easier 
 to attack computer systems than it is to defend them and that reality is going to 
 hold for the foreseeable future 
 I worry that we 're in the same position as the nuclear industry was in the early 
 50s We have an amazing new technology with real potential but we are not 
 being honest about the risks and our incapacity to store a wasteful and harmful 
 byproduct for periods of time much longer than how long the companies storing 
 them have existed.1 
 The last reactor in the United States was built in 1977 and the reason that we 
 do n't have new ones is in large part because we do n't have the public trust As a 
 small businessman in a big industry I worry that we are losing the trust of our 
 users It is hampering our ability to innovate because every time someone uses a 
 computer service or product they have to ask themselves What am I giving 
 away Where is it being stored And they 're not getting clear answers People 
 are being asked to make irrevocable decisions about their online lives over and 
 over again 
 The pattern that I 've seen in my industry is one of deceit We are not honest about 
 what we collect the uses we put it to and we are ashamed frankly of our 
 business models I 'm not ashamed of mine Like I said I take a small amount of 
 money and I provide a service and if you do n't like it I refund your your 11 
 dollars 
 But you 'll never get someone from Google or Facebook to speak honestly about 
 what it is they 're actually doing with their data and the uses they put it to 
 Instead what Silicon Valley seeks to do is evade They see a regulation and they 
 find a way around it 
 We do n't like banking regulations so we invent cryptocurrency and 
 we 're going to disrupt the entire financial system 
 We do n't like limits on discrimination in lending so we 're going to use 
 machine learning which is a form of money laundering for bias a way 
 to blame mathematical algorithms for the desire to simply avoid rules 
 that everybody else has to   industry 
 And we see now that Facebook is about to enter the the banking 
 system again through the side  own 
 cryptocurrency 
 I worry about this because Silicon Valley has been a force of dynamism It 's one of 
 the great success stories of American capitalism and we 're putting it at risk right 
  sensible regulation in place that creates the conditions for 
 innovation 
 I came to the United States as a kid from Communist Poland And I remember 
 calling my father sometimes a very expensive phone call and every few minutes 
 it would be   that said Rozmowa Kontrolowana ""2 And 
 that was the Polish government informing us that the conversation was being 
 listened   Police 
 At least the Polish state had the courtesy to say that it was eavesdropping 
 We should at least give people that courtesy have openness into what is being 
 collected what is being done with it and give some sense of agency so that 
 people no longer feel like their data is being extracted from them And we can 
 have new business models and a new flourishing again of innovation in an 
 industry that was once famous for it

81,Joseph R. Biden,Presidential Inaugural Address,2021," Thank you 
 Chief Justice Roberts Vice President Harris Speaker Pelosi Leader Schumer 
 Leader McConnell Vice President Pence my distinguished guests my fellow 
 Americans 
 This is America ’s day This is democracy ’s day a day of history and hope of 
 renewal and resolve Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested 
 anew and America has risen to the challenge 
 President Obama Yes 
 President Biden Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a 
 cause the cause of democracy The people The will of the people has been 
 heard and the will of the people has been heeded We 've learned again that 
 democracy is precious Democracy is fragile And at this hour my friends 
 democracy has prevailed 
 So now on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake the 
 Capitol ’s very foundation we come together as one nation under God indivisible 
 to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two 
 centuries as we look ahead in our uniquely American way restless bold 
 optimistic and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be 
 I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today I thank 
 them from the bottom of my heart And I know And I know the resilience of our 
 Constitution and the strength the strength of our nation as does President 
 Jimmy Carter who I spoke with last night but who can not be with us today but 
 whom we salute for his lifetime of service 
 I 've just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken the oath first 
  But the American story depends not on any one of 
 us not on some of us but on all of us on We the People who seek a more 
 perfect Union 
 This is a great nation We are good people And over the centuries through storm 
 and strife in peace and in war we 've come so far But we still have far to go We 'll 
 press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of 
 peril and significant possibilities much to repair much to restore much to heal 
 much to build and much to gain 
 Few people periods in our nation ’s history have been more challenged or 
 found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we ’re in now A 
 once in a century virus is silently stalks sic the country It ’s taken as many lives 
 in one year as America lost in all of World War II Millions of jobs have been lost 
 hundreds of thousands of businesses closed 
 A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us The dream of 
 justice for all will be deferred no longer A cry for survival comes from the planet 
 itself a cry that ca n’t be any more desperate or any more clear and now a rise in 
 political extremism white supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront 
 and we will defeat 
 To overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of 
 America requires so much more than words It requires the most elusive of all 
 things in a democracy unity Unity 
 In another January on New Year ’s Day in 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed the 
 Emancipation Proclamation When he put pen to paper the President said and I 
 quote If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my 
 whole soul is in it My whole soul is in it 
 Today on this January day my whole soul is in this bringing America together 
 uniting our people uniting our nation And I ask every American to join me in this 
 cause uniting to fight the foes we face anger resentment and hatred extremism 
 lawlessness violence disease joblessness and hopelessness 
 With unity we can do great things important things We can right wrongs We can 
 put people to work in good jobs We can teach our children in safe schools We can 
 overcome the deadly COVID-19 virus We can reward work and rebuild the 
 middle class and make health care secure for all We can deliver racial justice and 
 we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world 
 I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days I 
 know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real But I also know they are 
 not new Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal 
 that we 're all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear 
 demonization have long torn us apart The battle is perennial and victory is never 
 assured Through the Civil War the Great Depression World War 9/11 through 
 struggle sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed In 
 each of these moments enough of us enough have come together to carry all of 
 us forward 
 And we can do that now 
 History faith and reason show the way the way of unity We can see each other 
 not as adversaries but as neighbors We can treat each other with dignity and 
 respect We can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperature For 
 without unity there is no peace only bitterness and fury no progress only 
 exhausting outrage no nation only a state of chaos 
 This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forward 
 And we must meet this moment as the United States of America If we do that I 
 guarantee you we will not fail We have never ever ever ever failed in America 
 when we have acted together 
 And so today at this time n this place let 's start afresh all of us Let 's begin to 
 listen to one another hear one another see one another show respect to one 
 another Politics does n't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path 
 Every disagreement does n’t have to be a cause for total war And we must reject a 
 culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured 
 My fellow Americans we have to be different than this America has to be better 
 than this And I believe America is so much better than this Just look around 
 Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome as was mentioned earlier 
 completed amid the Civil War when the Union itself was literally hanging in the 
 balance Yet we endured We prevailed 
 Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream 
 Here we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protestors 
 tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote And today we mark the 
 swearing in of the first woman in American history elected to national office Vice 
 President Kamala Harris Do n’t tell me things ca n’t change 
 Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery where 
 heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace 
 And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence 
 to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy to drive us 
 from this sacred ground It did not happen It will never happen not today not 
 tomorrow not ever Not ever 
 To all those who supported our campaign I am   you 've placed 
 in us To all those who did not support us let me say this Hear me out as we 
 move forward Take a measure of me and my heart And if you still disagree so be 
 it That ’s democracy That ’s America The right to dissent peaceably within the 
 guardrails of our Republic is perhaps this nation ’s greatest strength Yet hear me 
 clearly Disagreement must not lead to disunion And I pledge this to you I will be 
 a President for all Americans all Americans And I promise you I will fight as hard 
 for those who did not support me as for those who did 
 Many centuries ago Saint Augustine a Saint of my church wrote that a people 
 was a multitude   objects of their love defined by the 
 common objects of the their love What are the common objects we as Americans 
 love That define us as Americans I think I know opportunity security liberty 
 dignity respect honor and yes the truth.1,2 
 Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson There is truth and there 
 are lies lies told for power and for profit and each of us has a duty and a 
 responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders leaders who 
 have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation to defend the 
 truth and defeat the lies 
 Look I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear 
 and trepidation I understand they worry about their jobs I understand like my 
 dad they lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling   wondering Can I keep my 
 healthcare Can I pay my mortgage Thinking about their families about what 
 comes next I promise you I get it But the answer is not to turn inward to retreat 
 into competing factions distrusting those who do n’t look like look like you or 
 worship the way you do or do n’t get their news from the same sources you do 
 We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus rural versus 
 urban conservative versus liberal We can do this if we open our souls instead of 
 hardening our hearts if we show a little tolerance and humility and if we ’re 
 willing to stand in the other person ’s shoes as my mom would say Just for a 
 moment stand in their shoes Because here ’s the thing about life There ’s no 
 accounting for what fate will deal you some days when you need a hand There 
 are other days when we ’re called to lend a hand That ’s how it has to be That ’s 
 what we do for one another And if we are this way our country will be stronger 
 more prosperous more ready for the future And we can still disagree 
 My fellow Americans in the work ahead of us we 're going tol need each other We 
 need all our strength to to persevere through this dark winter We 're entering 
 what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus We must set aside 
 politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation 
 President Obama Yes 
 President Biden One nation And I promise you this as the Bible says Weeping 
 may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning We will get through this 
 together Together 
 Look folks all my colleagues I served with in the House and the Senate up here 
 we all understand the world is watching watching all of us today So here is my 
 message to those beyond our borders America has been tested and we ’ve come 
 out stronger for it We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once 
 again not to meet yesterday ’s challenges but today ’s and tomorrow ’s 
 challenges And we ’ll lead not   of our power but by the 
 power of our example.3 
 We ’ll be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and security Look you 
 all know we ’ve been through so much in this nation And my first act as President 
 I ’d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those 
 who we lost this past year to the pandemic those 400,000 fellow Americans 
 moms dads husbands wives sons daughters friends neighbors and 
 co workers We 'll honor   people and the nation we know we 
 can and should be So I ask you let ’s say a silent prayer for those who ’ve lost 
 their lives and those left behind and for our country 
 Amen 
 Folks this is a time of testing We face an attack on our democracy and on truth a 
 raging virus growing inequity the sting of systemic racism a climate in crisis 
 America ’s role in the world Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in 
 profound ways but the fact is we face them all at once presenting this nation 
 with one of the gravest responsibilities we 've had Now we ’re going to be tested 
 Are we going to step up All of us It ’s time for boldness for there is so much to 
 do And this is certain I promise you We will be judged you and  
 resolve these cascading crises of our era 
 Will we rise to the occasion is the question Will we master this rare and difficult 
 hour Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our 
 children I believe we must I ’m sure you do as well I believe we will And when 
 we do we ’ll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of 
 America the American story a story that might sound something like a song 
 that means a lot to me It ’s called American Anthem There ’s one verse that 
 stands out at least for me and it goes like this 
 The work and prayers 
 of centur[ies have brought us to this day 
 What shall be our legacy 
 What will our children say 
 Let me know in my heart 
 When my days are through 
 America 
 America 
 I gave my best to you 
 Let 's add Let 's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our 
 great nation If we do this then when our days are through our children and our 
 children ’s children will say of us They gave their best They did their duty 
 They healed a broken land 
 My fellow Americans I close today where I began with a sacred oath before God 
 and all of you I give you my word I will always level with you I will defend the 
 Constitution I ’ll defend our democracy I ’ll defend America and will give all all of 
 you Keep everything I do in your service thinking not of power but of 
 possibilities not of personal interest but the public good And together we shall 
 write an American story of hope not fear of unity not division of light not 
 darkness a story of decency and dignity love and healing greatness and 
 goodness 
 May this be the story that guides us the story that inspires us and the story that 
 tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history We met the moment 
 Democracy and hope truth and justice did not die on our watch but thrived that 
 America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world 
 That is what we owe our forebears one another and generations to follow So 
 with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time sustained by faith 
  to one another and the country we love with all our 
 hearts 
 May God bless America and may God protect our troops 
 Thank you America",0.0178118590265512,0.0067597352899611,0.0351367332041263,0.4896335005760193,0.4192838668823242,0.0084370803087949,0.0229371730238199,0.1624398231079266,0.479075546101408,69.42157270094347,0.2535940195514664,0.011332312404287902,0.10887096774193548,0.05106076950737145,19.78787878787879,0.0
82,Volodymyr Zelenskyy,Address to a World Bank Ministerial Roundtable,2022," Dear Mr. President David Malpass 
 Dear Mrs. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva 
 Dear ladies and gentlemen ministers 
 Greetings to all present at this historic World Bank session and thank you for the 
 opportunity to address you today 
 This Sunday I spoke with Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva and heard very important 
 words from her Words about our state about Ukraine We talked with her in 
 particular about life in our city of Kharkiv It is the largest city in the east of 
 Ukraine 
 Russian troops have been shelling and bombing it for weeks In those parts of the 
 city where Russian weapons reach more than a thousand houses have already 
 been destroyed Russian artillery Russian missiles Russian air bombs do not 
 choose who to kill and which buildings to blow up and burn It is equally 
 dangerous both in the center of Kharkiv and on the outskirts You can die from 
 Russian shelling everywhere 
 But you need to know the people of Kharkiv You need to know our people Even 
 during the war during such shelling Kharkiv remains a fully functioning city 
 Mrs. Kristalina especially noted that in Kharkiv despite everything flowers are 
 planted trees are cultivated the streets are cleaned now and the city is generally 
 tidy That ’s what our Kharkiv is like That ’s what our people are like That ’s what 
 our Ukraine is like 
 We managed to liberate from the occupiers the cities and communities of three 
 northern regions of Ukraine Kyiv Chernihiv and Sumy We immediately do 
 everything to restore normal life there 
 Russian troops have destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses in these 
 regions Almost all social facilities most of the economically important enterprises 
 of Ukraine have been burned or need to be repaired 
 Thousands of people were killed 
 We restore electricity communications we restore water supply We restore 
 traffic set up temporary bridges across rivers instead of destroyed ones We 
 return social and administrative services We carry out demining 
 Several thousand explosive devices are neutralized daily These are mines 
 tripwire mines and shells left over from the Russian military 
 Imagine they mined even ordinary people 's homes Home appliances that they 
 failed to steal and take away Cars Basements They even mined agricultural 
 fields 
 But even in such conditions our people return home Ukrainians are already trying 
 to do everything to restore normal life Because that 's who we are Ukrainians 
 In the east of our state in Donbas in the south the situation is even worse And 
 right now active hostilities are still going on there Russia is still trying to develop 
 a new brutal offensive there 
 I will cite only one figure now so that you can understand the scale of Ukraine 's 
 ordeal our people 's ordeal 
 Due to the bombing and   in Ukraine 1,141 educational 
 institutions were destroyed or damaged Schools kindergartens universities All 
 over our country 
 Not every country in the world has as many educational institutions as destroyed 
 by Russian troops in Ukraine 
 And if so many educational institutions were destroyed you can imagine how 
 much else was destroyed Hospitals infrastructure businesses and ordinary 
 houses 
 The Russian invasion completely destroyed normal economic relations The first 
 loss analysis alone yielded approximately $ 550 billion in losses 
 Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov This has 
 significantly reduced Ukrainian exports including agricultural products Due to the 
 shortage of Ukrainian food on the world market the beginning of the crisis is 
 already being felt A recent   World Food Program stated that 
 rising food prices this year would lead to starvation of about 47 million people in 
 81 countries 
 Without Ukrainian wheat corn vegetable oil and other commodities this will 
 result not only in physical food shortages in many countries in Africa and Asia but 
 also in political instability and possibly a new migration crisis People will look for 
 the culprits of this crisis in particular taking to the squares in their countries in 
 their cities People will look for ways to escape 
 Of course we do our best to export our products We launched a sowing campaign 
 this year as much as possible But no one in the world can be sure that food 
 security can be guaranteed as long as this war continues Russia 's war on our 
 land 
 Stopping the war now and liberating our territory from Russian invaders is the 
 only reliable way to stop the food crisis 
 The Russian troops are deliberately destroying all facilities in our country that 
 could provide an economic basis for life Railway stations food warehouses 
 bakery plants oil terminals etc 
 As of now given the economic downturn and broken economic ties we need up to 
 $ 7 billion in financial support each month Ukraine will need hundreds of billions 
 of dollars to recover from this war I 'm sure each of you has these calculations 
 I 'm sure of it 
 We must also honestly say that Russia is accompanying this war against us with 
 aggressive measures on world markets They specifically create such conditions 
 that there is instability not only in the food market but also in the fuel market and 
 in the raw materials markets in general 
 Russia has provoked rising energy prices in Europe and more broadly in the 
 democratic world With sufficient export potential they have constantly held back 
 gas in particular to create painful price conditions for European consumers So 
 that people put pressure on their governments in the middle of the state for the 
 sake of Russia 's political interests 
 This and many other similar examples show that Russia can no longer be 
 considered a normal and reliable supplier of energy resources a normal and 
 reliable trading partner 
 Together we are able to implement solutions that will not only stop the aggressive 
 intentions of the Russian Federation not only support Ukraine in this war but also 
 inevitably show all the potential aggressors of the world that creating problems 
 for other states for other nations means creating problems for themselves 
 Because if we do not do this millions and millions of people in the world will 
 repeatedly suffer from the aggressive actions of individual states 
 So what steps are needed now 
 The first is immediate support for Ukraine so that the Russian leadership knows 
 that the war will not allow them to realize any of their aggressive goals I am sure 
 that our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance who are present at this 
 meeting will talk about the details of such financial support 
 We must do everything to ensure that Ukraine and Ukrainians have everything 
 they need to live despite the war In Kharkiv which I mentioned at the beginning 
 of this speech and in all other cities and communities of Ukraine Everywhere 
 Second Russia must be immediately excluded from all international financial 
 institutions The IMF the World Bank and others are definitely not the place for a 
 state that is trying to ruin the lives of its neighbors 
 Third we need a special tax for the war Russia and after it any other aggressor 
 must pay for violating global stability Such a tax for the war should be imposed 
 on all without exception trade transactions with Russia as a state or with Russian 
 companies On all export import transactions all financial transactions that have 
 not yet been blocked 
 Funds from the war tax should be used to help Ukraine rebuild everything that 
 Russia destroyed in the war Or if this tax is applied to another aggressor the 
 funds should be directed to the victim of that war 
 The world needs an effective tool to respond to the destructive actions of those 
 who do not want to maintain common security and work for the common good of 
 all in the world I am convinced that a special tax for the war can become such a 
 tool 
 Fourth every country in the world needs to prepare now for the possible complete 
 severance of any relations with Russia No one should depend on the political 
 mood of the leadership of this state If the world is ready to isolate Russia 
 completely the Russian leadership will have a motive to avoid any war 
 And fifth significant assets of the Russian state and representatives of the 
 Russian elite have already been blocked However these are not all their assets 
 that we are aware of This blocking work must be continued And not just as an 
 end in itself Russia 's blocked funds must be used both to rebuild Ukraine after the 
 war and to compensate for the damage that Russia has caused to other nations 
 with its destructive behavior 
 If because of the war   starts in certain regions or if 
 some countries are substantially  Russian assets 
 could be used to pay for aid and compensation 
 We must use all our strength to make Russia feel punishment for this war And 
 feel how great the need to restore peace is including for Russia itself 
 you can help yourself as well Stabilize the financial situation in 
 our region and in the world in general Ensure security in key markets starting 
 with food 
 With your financial support and decisions we will quickly rebuild our state And 
 this means not only new opportunities for business from different countries not 
 only new opportunities for economic growth but also concrete evidence that 
 global financial institutions are able to work in the interests of ordinary people in 
 the interests of humanity as a whole 
 I want one of the next such meetings to take place in Ukraine In one of our cities 
 maybe in Kharkiv with your support 
 Thank you very much for your attention",0.4018746018409729,0.0686975643038749,0.3276126682758331,0.0357188954949379,0.0853173285722732,0.0552871376276016,0.0254919212311506,0.0571371897333435,0.3587740998317919,52.11539682539683,0.2892635314995563,0.011752682677567705,0.10416666666666667,0.06545247581104155,17.63063063063063,0.0
83,Shawnee Chief Tecumseh,Address to General William Henry Harrison,1810," Houses are built for you to hold councils in Indians hold theirs in the open air I 
 am a Shawnee My forefathers were warriors Their son is a warrior From them I 
 take my only existence From my tribe I take nothing I have made myself what I 
 am And I would that I could make the red people as great as the conceptions of 
 my own mind when I think of the Great Spirit that rules over us all I would not 
 then come to Governor Harrison to ask him to tear up the treaty the 1795 Treaty 
 of Greenville which gave the United States parts of the Northwest Territory 
 But I would say to him Brother you have the liberty to return to your own 
 country You wish to prevent the Indians from doing as we wish them to unite 
 and let them consider their lands as a common property of the whole You take the 
 tribes aside and advise them not to come into this measure You want by your 
 distinctions of Indian tribes in allotting to each a particular to make them war 
 with each other You never see an Indian endeavor to make the white people do 
 this You are continually driving the red people when at last you will drive them 
 into the great lake Lake Michigan where they can neither stand nor work 
 Since my residence at Tippecanoe we have endeavored to level all distinctions to 
 destroy village  mischiefs are done It is they who sell their 
 land to the Americans Brother this land that was sold and the goods that was 
 sic given for it was only   In the future we are prepared to punish 
 those who propose to sell land to the Americans If you continue to purchase 
 them it will make war among the different tribes and at last I do not know what 
 will be the consequences among the white people 
 Brother I wish you would take pity on the red people and do as I have requested 
 If you will not give up the land and do cross the boundary of our present 
 settlement it will be vary hard and produce great trouble between us 
 The way the only way to stop this evil is for the red people to unite in claiming a 
 common and equal right in the land as it was at first and should be now for it 
 was never divided but belongs to all 
 No tribe has the right to sell even to each other much less to strangers 
 Sell a country Why not sell the air the great sea as well as the earth Did not 
 the Great Spirit make them all for the use of his children 
 How can we have confidence in the white people We have good and just reasons 
 to believe we have ample grounds to accuse the Americans of injustice especially 
 when such great acts of injustice have been   our race of 
 which they seem to have no manner of regard or even to reflect When Jesus 
 Christ came upon the earth you killed him and nailed him to the cross You thought 
 he was dead and you were mistaken You have the Shakers among you and you 
 laugh and make light of their worship Everything I have told you is the truth The 
 Great Spirit has inspired me",0.4905122518539428,0.1613680571317672,0.0581255480647087,0.0073852757923305,0.2104740440845489,0.0697629898786544,0.0023718874435871,0.1626447876447876,0.3749034749034749,74.69647058823529,0.3720238095238095,0.011661807580174927,0.1638655462184874,0.14026402640264027,19.6,0.0
84,Nelson Mandela,Rally Address Following Release From Pollsmoor Prison,1990," My friends comrades and fellow South Africans I greet you 
 all in the name of peace democracy and freedom for all I 
 stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant 
 of you the people Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have 
 made it possible for me to be here today I therefore place the 
 remaining years of my life in your hands On this day of my 
 release I extend my sincere and warmest gratitude to the 
 millions of my compatriots and those in every corner of the 
 globe who have campaigned tirelessly for my release I extend 
 special greetings to the people of Cape Town the city to which 
 which has been my home for three decades Your mass 
 marches and other forms of struggle have served as a constant 
 source of strength to all political prisoners I salute the African 
 National Congress It has fulfilled our every expectation in its 
 role as leader of the great march to freedom I salute our 
 President Comrade Oliver Tambo for leading the ANC even 
 under the most difficult circumstances I salute the 
 rank and file members of the ANC You have sacrificed life 
 and limb in the pursuit of the noble cause of our struggle I 
 salute combatants of Umkhonto We Sizwe like Solomon 
 Mahlangu and Ashley Kriel who have paid the ultimate price 
 for the freedom of all South Africans I salute the South 
 African Communist Party for its sterling contribution to the 
 struggle for democracy You have survived 40 years of 
 unrelenting persecution The memory of great communists like 
 Moses Kotane Yusuf Dadoo Bram Fischer and Moses 
 Mabhida will be cherished for generations to come I salute 
 General Secretary Joe Slovo one of our finest patriots We are 
  that the alliance between ourselves and 
 the Party remains as strong as it it always was I salute the 
 United Democratic Front the National Education Crisis 
 Committee the South African Youth Congress the Transvaal 
 and Natal Indian Congresses and COSATU and the many 
 other formations of the Mass Democratic Movement I also 
 salute the Black Sash and the National Union of South 
 African Students We note with pride that you have looked 
 that you have acted as the conscience of white South Africa 
 Even during the darkest days in the history of our struggle you 
 held the flag of liberty high The large scale mass mobilization 
 of the past few years is one of the key factors which led to the 
 opening of the final chapter of our struggle I extend my 
 greetings to the working class of our country Your Your 
 organized strength is the pride of our movement You remain 
 the most dependable force in the struggle to end exploitation 
 and oppression I pay tribute I pay tribute to the many 
 religious communities who carried the campaign for justice 
 forward when the organizations of our people were silenced I 
 greet the traditional leaders of our country many among you 
 continue to walk in the footsteps of great heroes like Hintsa 
 and Sekhukhune I pay tribute to the endless heroism of the 
 youth you the young lions You the young lions have 
 energized our entire struggle I pay tribute to the mothers and 
 wives and sisters of our nation You are the rock hard 
 foundation of our struggle Apartheid has inflicted more pain 
 on you than on anyone else On this occasion we thank the 
 world we thank the world community for their great 
 contribution to the anti apartheid struggle Without your 
 support our struggle would not have reached this advanced 
 stage The sacrifice of the frontline states will be remembered 
 by South Africans forever My salutations will be incomplete 
 without expressing my deep appreciation for the strength given 
 to me during my long and lonely years in 
 wife and family I am convinced that your pain and suffering 
 was far greater than my own Before I go any further I wish to 
 make the point that I intend making only a few preliminary 
 comments at this stage I will make a more complete statement 
 only after I have had the opportunity to consult with my 
 comrades 
 Today the majority of South Africans black and white 
 recognize that apartheid has no future It has to be ended by 
 our own decisive mass action in order to build peace and 
 security The mass campaigns of defiance and other actions of 
 our organizations and people can only culminate in the 
 establishment of democracy The apartheid destruction on our 
 sub continent is in calculable The fabric of family life of 
 millions of my people has been shattered Millions are 
 homeless and unemployed Our economy Our economy lies 
 in ruins and our people are embroiled in political strife Our 
 resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of the 
 military wing of the ANC Umkhonto we Sizwe was a purely 
 defensive action against the violence of apartheid The factors 
 which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today We have 
 no option but to continue We express the hope that a climate 
 conducive to a negotiated settlement will be created soon so 
 that there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle I 
 am a loyal and disciplined member of the African National 
 Congress I am therefore in full agreement with all of its 
 objectives strategies and tactics The need to unite the people 
 of our country is as important a task now as it always has 
 been No individual leader is able to take on this enormous 
 task on his own It is our task as leaders to place our views 
 before our organization and to allow the democratic structures 
 to decide on the way forward On the question of democratic 
 practice I feel duty bound to make the point that a leader of 
 the movement is a person who has been democratically elected 
 at a national conference This is a principle which must be 
 upheld without any exceptions Today I wish to report to you 
 that my talks with the government have been aimed at 
 normalizing the political situation in the country We have not 
 as yet begun discussing the basic demands of the struggle I 
 wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered into 
 negotiations about the future of our country except to insist on 
 a meeting between the ANC and the government Mr. De Klerk 
 has gone further than any other Nationalist President in 
 taking real steps to normalize the situation However there are 
 further steps as outlined in the Harare Declaration that have 
 to be met before negotiations on the basic demands of our 
 people can begin I reiterate our call for inter alia² the 
 immediate ending of the State of Emergency and the freeing of 
 all and not only some political prisoners Only such a 
 normalized situation which allows for free political activity 
 can allow us to consult our people in order to obtain a 
 mandate The people need to be consulted on who will 
 negotiate and on the content of such negotiations 
 Negotiations can not take place Negotiations can not take up 
 a place above the heads or behind the backs of our people It is 
 our belief that the future of our country can only be 
  which is democratically elected on a 
 non racial basis Negotiations on the dismantling of apartheid 
 will have to address the overwhelming demands of our people 
 for a democratic non racial and unitary South Africa There 
 must be an end to white monopoly on political power and a 
 fundamental restructuring of our political and economic 
 systems to ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are 
 addressed and our society thoroughly democratized It must be 
 added that Mr. De Klerk himself is a man of integrity who is 
 acutely aware of the dangers of a public figure not honoring 
 his undertakings But as an organization we base our policy 
 and strategy on the harsh reality we are faced with And this 
 reality is that we are still suffering under the policies of the 
 Nationalist government 
 Our struggle has reached a decisive moment We call on our 
 people to seize this moment so that the process towards 
 democracy is rapid and uninterrupted We have waited too 
 long for our freedom We can no longer wait Now is the time 
 to intensify the struggle on all fronts To relax our efforts now 
 would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able 
 to forgive The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should 
 encourage us to redouble our efforts It is only through 
 disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured We 
 call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a 
 new South Africa The freedom movement is a political home 
 for you too We call on the international community to 
 continue the campaign to isolate the apartheid regime To lift 
 sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process 
 towards the complete eradication of apartheid Our march to 
 freedom is irreversible We must not allow fear to stand in our 
 way Universal suffrage on a common voters role in a united 
 democratic and non racial South Africa is the only way to 
 peace and racial harmony In conclusion I wish to go to my 
 own words during my trial in 1964 They are as true today as 
 they were then I wrote I have fought against white 
 domination and I have fought against black domination I 
 have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in 
 which all persons live together in harmony and and with 
 equal opportunities It is an ideal which I hope to live for and 
 to achieve But if needs be it is an ideal for which I am 
 prepared to die.3",0.014934510923922,0.0152879329398274,0.007054797373712,0.7858232855796814,0.1395420879125595,0.0314096994698047,0.0059476280584931,0.1067505690186102,0.4479678225554515,53.52318570318573,0.3352272727272727,0.013824884792626729,0.10755148741418764,0.05747767857142857,21.0,0.0
85,Abraham Lincoln,Second Inaugural Address,1865," Fellow Countrymen 
 At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for 
 an extended address than there was at the first Then a statement somewhat in detail of a 
 course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper Now at the expiration of four years 
 during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase 
 of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the 
 nation little that is new could be presented The progress of our arms upon which all else 
 chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is I trust reasonably 
 satisfactory and encouraging to all With high hope for the future no prediction in regard to 
 it is ventured 
 On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed 
 to an impending civil war All dreaded it all sought to avert it While the inaugural address 
 was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the Union without war 
 insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the 
 Union and divide  parties deprecated war but one of them 
 would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather 
 than let it perish And the war came 
 One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the 
 Union but localized in the Southern part of it These slaves constituted a peculiar and 
 powerful interest All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war To 
 strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents 
 would rend the Union  the government claimed no right to do more than 
 to restrict the territorial enlargement of it Neither party expected for the war the 
 magnitude or the duration which it has already attained Neither anticipated that the cause 
 of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease Each looked 
 for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding Both read the same 
 Bible and pray to the same God and each invokes His aid against the other 
 It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God 's assistance in wringing 
 their bread from the sweat of other men 's faces but let us judge not that we be not judged 
 The prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully The 
 Almighty has His own purposes Woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs 
 be that offences come but woe to that   offence cometh 
 If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which in the providence 
 of God must needs come but which having continued through His appointed time He now 
 wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due 
 to   offence came shall we discern therein any departure from those 
 divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him Fondly do we 
 hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away 
 Yet if God wills that it continue until all the wealth -man 's two hundred 
 and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the 
 lash shall be   with the sword as was said three thousand years ago 
 so still it must be said the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether 
 With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to 
 see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation 's wounds 
 to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all 
 which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all 
 nations",0.0141714364290237,0.0320369526743888,0.6406669020652771,0.0386675298213958,0.1595411151647567,0.015973450616002,0.0989426523447036,0.090638624768089,0.4372626777983922,59.95938053097348,0.4334085778781038,0.0071090047393364926,0.11314984709480122,0.14324324324324325,31.25925925925926,0.0

 dissent because I am among the millions outraged outraged because the FCC 
 pulls its own teeth abdicating responsibility to protect the nation ’s broadband 
 consumers 
 Now some may ask Why are we witnessing such unprecedented groundswell of 
 public support for keeping the 2015 net neutrality protections in place Because 
 the public can plainly see that a soon to be toothless FCC is handing the keys to 
 the Internet the Internet one of the most remarkable empowering enabling 
 inventions of our lifetime over to a handful of multi billion dollar corporations 
 And if past is prologue those very same broadband Internet service providers 
 that the majority says you should trust to do  put profits and 
 shareholders returns above what is best for you 
 Each of us raised our hands when we were sworn in as FCC Commissioners We 
 took an oath and promised to uphold our duties and responsibilities to I quote 
 here 
 make available so far as possible to all the people of the United 
 States without discrimination a rapid efficient Nation wide and 
 world wide wire and radio communication service with adequate 
 facilities at reasonable charges.1 
 Today the FCC majority is about to officially abandon that pledge and millions are 
 watching and taking note 
 I do not believe that there are any FCC or Congressional offices immune to the 
 deluge of consumer outcry We are even hearing about state and local offices 
 fielding calls and what is newsworthy is that at last count and I think that 
 number is rising five Republican Members of Congress went on the record in 
 calling for a halt to today ’s vote Why such a bipartisan outcry Because the large 
 majority of Americans are in favor of keeping strong net neutrality rules in place 
 But the saddest part to me about all of this and it 's painful for me to say this 
 that this is the new norm at the FCC a norm where the majority ignores the will of 
 the people a norm where the majority stands   people they are 
 committed to serve that they 've taken an oath to serve are about to lose so 
 much 
 We have heard story after story of what net neutrality means to consumers and 
 small businesses from places as diverse as Los Angeles Skid Row and Marietta 
 Ohio I hold in my hand letters that plead with the FCC to keep our net neutrality 
 rules in place but what is striking and in keeping with the new norm despite the 
 millions of comments letters and calls received this Order cites not even one 
 consumer comment That speaks volumes about the direction the FCC is heading 
 That speaks volumes about just who is being heard at the FCC 
 Sole proprietors whose entire business model depends on an open Internet are 
 worried that the absence of clear and enforceable net neutrality protections will 
 result in higher costs and fewer benefits because you see they are not able to pay 
 tolls for premium access Even large online businesses have weighed in 
 expressing concern about being subject to added charges as they simply try to 
 reach their own customers Engineers have submitted comments including many 
 of the Internet ’s pioneers sharing with the FCC majority the fundamentals of how 
 the Internet works because from where they sit there is no way that an item like 
 this would ever see the light of day if the majority understood the platform some 
 of them helped to create 
 I have heard from innovators worried that we are standing up a mother may I 
 regime where the broadband provider becomes arbiter of acceptable online 
 business models And yes I have heard from consumers who are worried given 
 that their broadband provider has already shown that they will charge inscrutable 
 below the line fees raise prices unexpectedly and put consumers on hold for 
 hours at a time Who will have their best interests at heart in a world without clear 
 and enforceable rules   with clear enforcement authority A 
 toothless FCC 
 There has been a darker side to all of this over the past few weeks Threats and 
 intimidation Personal attacks Nazis cheering Russian influence Fake comments 
 Those are unacceptable Some are illegal They all are to be rejected But what is 
 also not acceptable is the FCC ’s refusal to cooperate with state attorney general 
 investigations or allow evidence in the record that would undercut a preordained 
 outcome 
 Many have asked what happens next How will all of this net neutrality my 
 Internet experience look after today My answer is simple When the current 
 protections are abandoned and the rules that have been officially in place since 
 2015 are repealed we will have a Cheshire cat version of net neutrality We will be 
 in a world where regulatory substance fades to black and all that is left is a 
 broadband provider ’s toothy grin and those oh so comforting words we have 
 every incentive to do the right thing What they will soon have is every incentive 
 to do their own thing 
 Now the results of throwing out your net neutrality protections may not be felt 
 right away Most of us will get up tomorrow morning and over the next week 
 wade through hundreds of headlines turn away from those endless 
 prognosticators and submerge ourselves in a sea of holiday bliss But what we 
 have wrought will one day be apparent  you really see what has 
 changed I fear it may be too late to do anything about it because there will be no 
 agency empowered to address your concerns This item insidiously ensures the 
 FCC will never be able to fully grasp the harm it may have unleashed on the 
 Internet ecosystem And that inability might lead decisionmakers to conclude that 
 the next Internet startup that failed to flourish and attempted to seek relief 
 simply had a bad business plan when in fact what was missing was a level playing 
 field online 
 Particularly damning is what today ’s repeal will mean for marginalized groups like 
 communities of color that rely on platforms like the Internet to communicate 
 because traditional outlets do not consider their issues or concerns worthy of 
 coverage It was through social media that the world first heard about the police 
 shooting in Ferguson Missouri because legacy news outlets did not consider it 
 important until the hashtag started trending It has been through online video 
 services that a targeted entertainment ecosystem has thrived where stories are 
 finally being told because those same programs were repeatedly rejected by 
 mainstream distribution and media outlets And it has been through secure 
 messaging platforms where activists have communicated and organized for 
 justice without gatekeepers with differing opinions blocking them 
 Where will the next significant attack on Internet freedom come from Maybe 
 from a broadband provider allowing its network to congest making a high traffic 
 video provider ask what more can it pay to make the pain stop That will never 
 happen you say Well it already has The difference now is the open question of 
 what is stopping them The difference after today ’s vote is that no one will be 
 able to stop them 
 Maybe several providers will quietly roll out paid prioritization packages that 
 enable deep pocketed players to cut the queue Maybe a vertically integrated 
 broadband provider decides that it will favor its own apps and services Or some 
 high value Internet of things traffic will be subject to an additional fee Maybe 
 some of these actions will be cloaked under nondisclosure agreements and 
 wrapped up in mandatory arbitration clauses so that it will be a breach of contract 
 to disclose these publicly or take the provider to court over any wrongdoing Some 
 may say of course this will never happen But after today ’s vote what will be in 
 place to stop them 
 What we do know is that broadband providers did not even wait for the ink to dry 
 on this Order before making their moves One broadband provider who had in the 
 past promised to not engage in paid prioritization has now quietly dropped that 
 promise from its list of commitments on its website What ’s next   Blocking or 
 throttling That will never happen After today ’s vote exactly who is the cop on 
 the beat that can or will stop them 
 And just who will be impacted the most Consumers and small businesses that ’s 
 who The Internet continues to evolve and has become ever more critical for every 
 participant in our 21st century ecosystem government services have migrated 
 online as have educational opportunities and job notices and applications but at 
 the same time broadband providers have continued to consolidate becoming 
 bigger They own their own content they own media companies and they own or 
 have an interest in other types of services 
 Why are millions so alarmed Because they understand the risks this all poses and 
 even those who may not know exactly what Title II authority is know that they 
 will be at risk without it 
 I have been asking myself repeatedly why the majority is so singularly focused on 
 overturning these wildly popular rules Is it simply because they felt that the 
 2015 net neutrality order which threw out over 700 rules and dispensed with 
 more than 25 provisions was too heavy handed Is this a ploy to create a need 
 for legislation where there was none before Or is it to establish uncertainty 
 where little previously existed 
 Is it a tactic to undermine the net neutrality protections adopted in 2015 that are 
 currently parked at the Supreme Court You know the same rules that were 
 resoundingly C. Circuit last year No doubt we will see a rush to 
 the courthouse asking the Supreme Court to vacate and remand the substantive 
 rules we fought so hard for over the past few years because today the FCC uses 
 legally suspect means to clear the decks of substantive protections for consumers 
 and competition 
 It is abundantly clear why we see so much bad process with this item because the 
 fix was already in There is no real mention of the thousands of net neutrality 
 complaints  The majority has refused to put them in the 
 record while maintaining the rhetoric that there have been no real violations 
 Record evidence of the massive incentives and abilities of broadband providers to 
 act in anti competitive ways are missing from the docket Why Because those in 
 charge have refused to use the data and knowledge the agency does have and has 
 relied upon in the past to inform our merger reviews As the majority has shown 
 again and again the views of individuals do not matter including the views of 
 those who care deeply about the substance but are not Washington insiders 
 There is a basic fallacy underlying the majority ’s actions and rhetoric today the 
 assumption of what is best for broadband providers is best for America 
 Breathless claims about unshackling broadband services from unnecessary 
 regulation are only about ensuring that broadband providers have the keys to the 
 Internet Assertions that this is merely a return to some imaginary status quo 
 ante can not hide the fact that this is the very first time that the FCC has 
 disavowed substantive protections for consumers online 
 I have made it clear that I am no lawyer so while I make some policy points 
 below I will attach a more legally oriented appendix to my statement 
 Two years ago the FCC minority predicted that the sky was going to fall Not 
 literally but that all manner of harms would befall the Internet ecosystem as a 
 result of the FCC ’s reclassification of broadband Just like the minority in 2010 
 predicted that the much more modest net neutrality rules would hamstring the 
 Internet as we know it no concrete harms were ever shown 
 It is telling that the draft cites deep regulatory uncertainty as justification for 
 repealing the 2015 Open Internet Order and includes sparse citations to the 
 record To be fair we have seen self serving statements from broadband providers 
 that our net neutrality rules have somehow hamstrung them from bringing 
 innovative new offerings to market before But they never did tell us what those 
 offerings would have been at any real level of detail My view is that if there 
 indeed were innovative offerings that would have garnered any real consumer 
 interest the better course would have been to make those ideas public and let 
 consumers badger the contrarian FCC into submission Indeed providers actually 
 did bring to market sponsored data and zero rating plans that the FCC closely 
 reviewed But since no detailed plans of these other phantom offerings that were 
 allegedly   were made public my sense is that those 
 offerings were as real as rainbow maned unicorns 
 As I mentioned in my dissent to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM the 
 majority ’s reliance on broadband providers assertions of reductions in investment 
 is highly flawed Nothing in this item convinces me that investment has dropped 
 as a result of our net neutrality policies I ’d suggest taking a look at my dissent 
 from the NPRM on this point and incorporate that 
 generally since the majority has failed to take my concerns into account.2 
 For one even a Statistics 101 student knows that correlation does not equal 
 causation Simply identifying an effect lends no insight into what caused it So too 
 with capital expenditures To suggest that net neutrality rules shifted billions of 
 dollars in capital beggars the imagination and the record offers no proof that 
 investment trends match the regulatory landscape The purported natural 
 experiment research approach in the draft also fails because it does not seek to 
 isolate differences between the past and present For as dynamic a market as the 
 majority suggests the broadband market is and as interested in economic rigor as 
 they claim to be it would be good policymaking to attempt to isolate the relevant 
 variables 
 And to make it even more ridiculous the broadband capital expenditures trend 
  investment has dropped follows the capital 
 expenditures trend in the nation more broadly The Federal Reserve Bank of St. 
 Louis tracks Gross Private Domestic Investment a component of the gross 
 domestic product that tracks capital expenditures across all industries in the 
 United States If you believe the information   in 
 the record that information tracks the Fed ’s assessment of investment in the 
 broader economy   This suggests that any alleged decrease in investment by 
 broadband providers could be due to macroeconomic factors that influenced the 
 overall economy rather than the 2015 Open Internet rules 
 This item ’s justification for rolling back our light touch Title II approach is 
 grounded primarily in assertions that this is simply returning to the regulatory 
 status quo ante The item even cites precedent going as far back as 1998 for the 
 proposition that the FCC has always considered Internet service an information 
 service Well take a walk back with me down the halls of FCC Past 
 It is the 1960 ’s and 70 ’s when packet switched precursors to Internet access were 
 uniformly considered Title II services The FCC was thoughtfully considering 
 packet switched networks as early as 1966 when it launched the first Notice of 
 Inquiry into the interdependence of computers and common carrier 
 telecommunications services Now all telecom geeks know that the ARPANET was 
 the precursor to the commercial Internet but what you may not know is how close 
 we came to having it owned by AT&T. In the early 1970s AT&T was approached 
 with a proposition buy ARPANET and operate it as a public common carrier 
 service AT&T declined because it did not fit with their business objectives It was 
 over a decade later before AT&T developed its own packet switching solution 
 So the logical thing to do was commercialize the offering itself Some key 
 ARPANET players thus founded Telenet Corporation and in 1973 applied for a FCC 
 license to operate the nascent service on a common carrier basis offering 
 functionality like database access and electronic mail In 1974 the FCC approved 
 Telenet ’s application and began offering the service filing its first tariff on August 
 15 1975 
 What does this show That the FCC majority is being disingenuous in its retelling 
 of regulatory history particularly as it relates to Internet and packet switched 
 services This majority is not returning to a time where packet switched 
 networking and the Internet access variant in particular were regulated as Title 
 I services Indeed the item is internally inconsistent since it admits that Digital 
 Subscriber Line DSL services were regulated as Title II services until 2005 Even 
 after 2005 and to this day hundreds of wireline carriers continue to offer 
 broadband as a Title II service 
 It was not until the early 2000s that the FCC began deregulating Internet 
 transmission Up until that point broadband providers were required to line share 
 and unbundle their networks which allowed vibrant retail competition for Internet 
 access over the incumbent networks It was only when as a policy matter the FCC 
 decided to collapse the protocol stack and rely wholly on intermodal competition 
 for fixed services that it had to decide what to do with the transmission 
 component that was clearly a telecommunications service 
 These are issues with which the FCC has struggled mightily and I am sure will 
 continue to struggle with in the future But painting the FCC ’s past approach to 
 Internet access as a deregulatory nirvana fails to grapple with the truth of our 
 regulatory past 
 As I have said before it makes no sense to take regulatory protections away from 
 a transmission medium that consumers use to connect to the world and go about 
 their business It makes even less sense when you realize that voice service 
 which contains many of the same transmission properties is treated as a Title II 
 service 
 While much of the item is focused on whether broadband has this capability or 
 not whether that capability is offered to consumers or not I believe it is 
 instructive just to bring it up a level and compare the FCC ’s historic classification 
 of voice service with broadband service Again it makes absolutely no sense that 
 broadband is about to be a Title I service while voice service is a Title II service 
 And as I noted in my dissent to the NPRM there is not a single modern service 
 that the majority would characterize as a telecommunications service effectively 
 reading that definition out of the statute Hundreds of computer scientists who 
 filed in the record agree that this reclassification is nonsensical and does not 
 match up with the underlying Internet technology This can easily be lost in the 
 regulatory gobbledygook that I will let the lawyers deal with but I think it is 
 illuminating to make a few points about this 
 From a consumer perspective both voice and broadband serve to connect people 
 and information For a voice service you type in the person ’s name on your 
 smartphone hit the dial button and in a matter of milliseconds the phone 
 network does a series of database dips and passing of signaling information to 
 figure out the best network routing for your phone call The network connects the 
 two phones and now you can speak back and forth Now let ’s compare what 
 happens in the broadband context To visit a website you type in the name of the 
 website on your smartphone hit the enter key and in a matter of milliseconds the 
 broadband network does a series of database dips and passing of signaling 
 information to figure out what is the best network routing for your web session 
 The network connects your computer with the server and now you can send data 
 back and forth 
 Consumers use both of these services to connect to people and information It is 
 akin to counting angels dancing on a head of a pin to single out a database that 
 transforms identifiers into addresses DNS or Domain Name System and an 
 efficient routing mechanism caching in the broadband context to say that this 
 somehow transforms the transmission of information into something else Why 
 not single out the Local Exchange Routing Guide a database for voice service that 
 transforms identifiers into addresses as a reason to reclassify voice as an 
 information service   Or why not use virtual connection caching a mechanism for 
 more efficient routing on Time Division Multiplexing TDM networks as a reason 
 to reclassify voice as an information service On the consumer side does a call to 
 a voice menu that allows you to pay your credit card bill somehow turn your 
 telephone service into an information service Does a call to dial a forecast 
 number No I believe this exposes this as an outcome oriented decision devoid 
 of any reasonable mooring in technology or consumer expectations 
 And this becomes even more clear as the FCC majority clears the decks of all the 
 authority it could use to address these problems It neuters section 706 of the Act 
 a provision which the D.C. Circuit has said can reasonably be interpreted as a 
 substantive grant of authority It refuses to exercise ancillary authority or the 
 Commission ’s Title III authority All of this has far reaching consequences for the 
 future of the Internet and particularly for mobile broadband 
 Since the prior Administration 's first open Internet proceeding in 2010 I have 
 called upon my colleagues to protect consumers access to mobile broadband 
 services with the same rules that we imposed on fixed broadband services A 
 substantial percentage of consumers especially those in vulnerable communities 
 rely solely on mobile services for their communications needs and the lack of 
 competition in the commercial mobile wireless industry too often leaves them 
 vulnerable.3 
 Seven years later those circumstances have not changed even though every year 
 the percentage of mobile only households increases In 2010 it was 30 at the 
 end of 2016 it was 50.5%.4 According to the Pew Research Center the share of 
 Americans that own smartphones is now 77 up from just 35 in the first 
 survey of smartphone ownership conducted in 2011.5 And the commercial wireless 
 market has become even more consolidated leaving consumers with fewer 
 competitive options than they had in 2010 The U.S. Department of Justice or DOJ 
 uses the well known Herfindahl Hirschman index HHI to measure market 
 concentration and classifies markets with an HHI of less than 1500 as 
 unconcentrated and markets with an HHI of over 2500 as highly concentrated   In 
 2010 the HHI index for the commercial wireless market was 2868.6 Now it is over 
 3100.7 Since the percentage of consumers who rely solely on mobile for their 
 communications needs is increasing every year and the commercial wireless 
 industry is becoming increasingly consolidated the need to protect mobile 
 broadband consumers is even greater now than it was in 2010   Health Resources

 The majority ’s decision to now reclassify mobile broadband is based upon a 
 misguided analysis of the law and the relevant record evidence Congress did not 
 lock in the meaning of the phrase public switched network as referring to the 
 public switched telephone network more than 22 years ago If it had it would not 
 have included the words immediately following that phrase as such terms are 
  is an express delegation 
 of authority from Congress to the Commission and it allows the agency to adopt a 
 different definition for the public switched network when the facts warrant such a 
 change In 2015 the Commission determined that mobile broadband is 
 interconnected to the public switched network because through the use of 
 VoIP messaging and similar applications it effectively gives subscribers the 
 capability to communicate with all North American Numbering Plan NANP 
 endpoints as well as with all users of the Internet ”8 
 The D.C. Circuit upheld this determination as reasonable and went on to explain 
 that the record had additional evidence of applications that would allow a mobile 
 broadband or other computer user to employ a service enabling her to receive 
 telephone calls to her IP address ”9 
 The majority ’s order does not point to any changed circumstance that could 
 reasonably refute the FCC ’s decision that mobile broadband is interconnected to 
 the public switched network or the D.C. Circuit ’s rationale for upholding the Open 
 Internet Order on this issue The majority simply refuses to address them.10 
 The majority ’s finding that mobile broadband service does not interconnect with 
 the public switched telephone network also ignores record evidence to the 
 contrary A number of engineers and other parties filed comments explaining why 
 the PSTN and IP networks should not be viewed as two completely separate 
 networks.11 
 In fact the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF explained that technical 
 developments such as the E.164 Uniform Resource Identified and the 5 G Evolved 
 Packet Core enable mobile broadband services to directly connect with the PSTN.12 
 Although the majority discusses this EFF filing,13 it refuses to acknowledge this 
 evidence means mobile broadband Internet access services provide 
 interconnection to the public switched network using the NANP”14 and that 
 invalidates its determination that mobile broadband does not interconnect with 
 the PSTN 
 The majority also   not to exercise its Title III authority 
 Although the majority concedes that the Commission has authority to impose open 
 Internet conduct rules on mobile broadband service licensees it declines to do so 
 because of its view that this would lead to imposing regulatory burdens on mobile 
 licensees that are not placed on fixed broadband services I do not see how the 
 majority can properly reach that conclusion until it has reviewed the more than 
 47,000 complaints that the National Hispanic Media Coalition ’s NHMC FOIA 
 request revealed This is another reason why the Commission should have delayed 
 its vote on this item Before expressly declining to exert Title III authority the 
 Commission should have reviewed those complaints to determine if commercial 
 wireless licensees are blocking throttling or engaging in other unreasonable 
 conduct regarding mobile broadband services 
 And when the current rules are laid to waste we may be left with no one to 
 protect consumers This Order loudly crows about handing over authority of 
 broadband to the FTC an agency with no technical expertise in 
 telecommunications and one that may not have authority over broadband 
 providers in the first instance But do n’t just take my word for it even one of the 
 FTC ’s own Commissioners has articulated these very concerns 
 On the latter point we are still playing a waiting game which is why I asked my 
 colleagues to delay the vote until we knew for sure whether the FTC could even 
 exercise its limited role in the net neutrality space Unfortunately my request was 
 denied and we have plowed ahead with a wildly unpopular decision that will 
 ensure that regulatory authority is entrusted to an agency that is unable to enact 
 the strong prophylactic protections that are necessary to protect consumers and 
 competition in an online world 
 Even if the court were to come back and say that the FTC actually has authority to 
 address the non common carrier activities of these providers the FTC could still be 
 vulnerable Courts may deny the FTC ’s efforts to impose antitrust remedies on 
 broadband providers because the industry is ostensibly 
 Indeed Verizon v. Trinko contains language that suggests that where there is an 
 ostensible remedy for harm under the Communications Act the courts will not go 
 out of their way to find an antitrust violation So the very fact that the FCC 
 disclaims authority might also undermine the FTC ’s authority as well 
 And if the FTC were to apply its substantive authority the result may not that 
 friendly to consumers or competition Recall that the FTC must act after harm has 
 already occurred and must do so through litigation This means no clear rules of 
 the road for broadband and that a startup or sole proprietor will likely be long 
 gone before its complaint is adjudicated This also means that most consumer 
 harms are unlikely to reach the attention of the FTC since their standard is that 
 consumer injury must be substantial in order to state a claim under the FTC Act 
 In short we are trading in clear protections for uncertain ones rock solid legal 
 authority for a shaky one and robust enforcement authority for a weaker one And 
 I will note that some of the people who have criticized the FCC ’s authority in this 
 context have also criticized the FTC for their overreach My fear is that this is yet 
 another ploy to roll out the red carpet for broadband providers while putting 
 consumers in the long queue for the side door Welcome to a regulatory free zone 
 If you ’re wondering why the FCC is preempting state consumer protection laws in 
 this item without notice let me help you with a simple jingle that you can easily 
 commit to memory If it benefits industry preemption is good if it benefits 
 consumers preemption is bad 
 How else can we explain the now majority ’s loud dissent when the last 
 Administration attempted to open markets through preemption of laws that 
 unduly restricted municipal broadband How is it that the now majority was 
 shocked that state ’s rights were being countermanded when it came to creating 
 the Lifeline Broadband Provider certification process But when it comes to 
 ensuring that states can not enact broadband privacy protections net neutrality 
 protections or other consumer protections it somehow becomes urgent for the 
 FCC majority to step in and preempt states from doing so 
 Just how much notice was given for this state preemption position from a then 
 minority that cried process fouls every other meeting None This is contrary to 
 the Administrative Procedure Act and a Reagan era Executive Order that requires 
 notice and an opportunity for appropriate participation in the proceedings 
 whenever federalism issues are presented It is unfortunate that the FCC majority 
 was vocal and vociferous about their request for adequate notice but those 
 concerns seem to have now 
 But industry rightly should have been concerned because when the FCC has 
 refused to act in the past states and localities often move on their own Just look 
 at issues like broadband privacy or contribution reform where states are 
 soldiering ahead where the federal government is unwilling to act I expect that 
 the FCC ’s preemption actions here will be challenged and doubt that they will be 
 defensible 
 Reclassification will do more than wreak havoc on our rules It will also undermine 
 our universal service construct for years to come something which the Order 
 implicitly acknowledges 
 Right now we have a universal service framework which allows us to support 
 voice service and requires these voice service providers to deploy 
 broadband capable facilities The 10th Circuit has upheld this as reasonable But as 
 legacy voice goes the way of the dodo we no longer have a supported 
 telecommunications service something that sections 214 and 254 of the Act 
 require And heaven forbid a disgruntled auction loser in our Connect America 
 Fund or Mobility Fund auctions challenges the results because the auction winner 
 is not deploying a telecommunications service Mark my words as our 
 communications networks continue to transition away from legacy voice service 
 and towards services which the Commission refuses to recognize as common 
 carrier services our universal service construct will become weaker As legacy 
 voice continues to shrink so does the foundation of our universal service 
 mechanism Eventually it will all come toppling down 
 This impending implosion can not be made clearer than in the Lifeline context In 
 2016 the Commission boldly moved into the 21st century with a certification 
 construct that would have allowed broadband only Lifeline service Unfortunately 
 in 2017 we have a FCC majority that refuses to use that construct to allow 
 providers into the program and has in fact proposed to use its legal authority to 
 limit participation to facilities based providers This Order reaffirms that path and 
 suggests that the majority is not moving from its conclusion that over 70 of the 
 market for Lifeline will be decimated under this Commission ’s watch The majority 
 continues to remain silent as to how we can enable a broadband only Lifeline 
 offering I suspect there will be none which puts this agency out of compliance 
 with its primary directive to make available so far as possible to all the people of 
 the United States without discrimination adequate facilities at reasonable 
 charges 
 As I close my eulogy of our 2015 net neutrality rules carefully crafted rules that 
 struck an appropriate balance in providing consumer protections and enabling 
 opportunities and investment I take ironic comfort in the words of then 
 Commissioner Pai from 2015 because I believe this will ring true about this 
 Destroying Internet Freedom Order 
 I am optimistic that we will look back on today ’s vote as an aberration a 
 temporary deviation from the bipartisan path that has served us so well I 
 do n’t know whether this plan will be reversed by 
 Congress or   Commission But I do believe that its 
 days are numbered

87,Tzipi Livni,Address at the 62nd Session United Nations General Assembly,2007," Three thousand years ago the people of Israel journeyed from slavery in Egypt to 
 independence in the land of Israel The Bible tells us that on their voyage to liberty 
 they made a crucial stop and received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai 
 As the General Assembly gathers this year the Jewish people recall that historic 
  And every year at this time our people 
 remember that the long march to freedom requires the acceptance of humanity ’s 
 basic values 
 For 60 years since the rebirth of our State in our ancient homeland with 
 Jerusalem at its heart we have not lost sight of this principle The core values of 
 tolerance coexistence and peace that lie at the heart of every democracy must be 
 protected within societies and promoted between them This is the calling of our 
 generation 
 The conflict in our region is   reject these core values those 
 who seek power without responsibility those whose aim is not to realize their 
 own rights but to deny those rights for others At its heart this is a conflict not 
 about territory but about values 
 There is of course a territorial dimension to our dispute We know this and as we 
 have proven in the past we are prepared for the territorial compromise that 
 lasting peace entails But we also know especially after withdrawing from 
 Lebanon and Gaza that territorial   not bring peace unless 
 we address the core clash of values that lies beneath the conflict 
 Israel may be on the front lines of this battle but it is not our fight alone This is a 
 global battle The notion that this battle is a local one limited to isolated regions 
 collapsed in this city with the twin towers on a September morning six years ago 
 Today it is clear that the extremists are engaged in a bloody war against civilians 
 and communities against hearts and minds in every corner of the world 
 And it is clear too that the Middle East conflict is not the cause of this global 
 extremist agenda but a consequence of it Yes it is up to the parties in the Middle 
 East to settle their political conflict and Israel for its part desires to do so But 
 for success to be genuine and lasting you the nations of the world need to be 
 partners in a shared global struggle against the extremism and terror that feed 
 conflict for your sake not just for ours 
 It is in this spirit that I would like to speak today about resolving our particular 
 conflict but also about the wider battle being waged today the battle that 
 affects us all This battle is global not just because it targets civilians everywhere 
 but also because the extremists have taken aim at the fundamental pillars of every 
 modern society namely democracy tolerance and education These are the 
 new battlefields of the twenty first century and it is in these arenas more than 
 any other that the future of our world will be decided 
 I believe in democracy I believe in its extraordinary power to produce free and 
 peaceful societies founded on respect for human rights Democracy is a profound 
 ideal but it is also a vulnerable one 
 Today in different parts of the world extremists who are opposed to the very 
 ideals of democracy are entering the democratic process not to abandon their 
 violent agenda but to advance it As a spokesman for Al Qaida recently declared 
 We will use your democracy to destroy your democracy This should be a 
 wake up call for all of us 
 It is time to reclaim democracy and this 
 Genuine democracy is about values before it is about voting No true democracy on 
 Earth allows armed militia or groups with racist or violent agendas to participate 
 in elections But some demonstrate a troubling double standard There are some 
 who insist on high standards in their own country but forget them when they look 
 abroad Violent extremists who could never run for office at home are treated as 
 legitimate politicians when elected elsewhere As a result we empower those who 
 use democratic means to advance anti democratic ends And we strengthen the 
 forces of those who not only undermine their societies but also threaten our own 
 Today from this podium I call on the international community to adopt at the 
 global level what democracies apply at the national one a universal set of 
 standards for participation in genuine democratic elections We need a universal 
 democratic code that requires that all those seeking the legitimacy of the 
 democratic process earn   principles as State monopoly over 
 the lawful use of force the rejection of racism and violence and the protection of 
 the rights of others 
 The goal of such a universal code is not to dictate our values or to stifle legitimate 
 voices with which we may disagree Its goal is to protect core democratic values 
 from those determined to use the democratic system against itself and to make 
 clear that participation in the democratic process is not just a right it is also a 
 responsibility 
 I know that the temptation to engage with extremists can be strong It may seem 
 to promise stability and quiet We may hope   beast we can 
 gradually tame it As free societies we pride ourselves rightly on our respect for 
 difference and diversity But we do a disservice to diversity when in its name we 
 tolerate the intolerant 
 Bitter experience has shown that buying off extremists is a short term fix for 
 which we will pay dearly in the long run Instead groups such as Hamas and 
 Hizbullah must be presented with a clear choice between the path of violence and 
 the path of legitimacy They can not have both And it is this same stark choice that 
 must be presented to the radical regime in Iran 
 No responsible State disagrees that Iran is the most prominent sponsor of 
 terrorism It is a major source of instability and conflict in Iraq Lebanon Palestine 
 and across the entire Middle East and it is the enemy of Arab Israeli coexistence 
 No one disagrees that Iran denies the Holocaust and speaks openly of its desire to 
 wipe a Member State mine off the map And no one disagrees that in violation 
 of Security Council resolutions it is actively pursuing the means to achieve this 
 end 
 But there are still those who in the name of consensus and engagement continue 
 to obstruct the urgent steps that are needed to bring Iran ’s sinister ambitions to a 
 halt Too many see the danger but they walk  someone else 
 will take care of it What is the value we have to ask of an organization which is 
 unable to take effective action in the face of a direct assault on the very principles 
 it was founded to protect 
 It is time for the United Nations and the States of the world to live up to their 
 promise of never again to say enough is enough to act now and to defend their 
 basic values It is also time to see this same kind of moral conviction in the Human 
 Rights Council so that it can become a shield for the victims of human rights not 
 a weapon for its abusers 
 Israel has never tried to avoid genuine discussion of its human rights record But 
 so long as the Council maintains its wildly disproportionate focus on Israel it 
 weakens the moral voice of the United Nations and the price of this blindness is 
  of human rights atrocities in Darfur and Myanmar and 
 throughout the world 
 There is no more accurate forecast for the future of a society than the lessons we 
 teach our children Unfortunately in our region we see children ’s television 
 programs in which Mickey Mouse puppets teach the glory of being a suicide 
 bomber and a seven year old girl sings of her dreams of blood and battle Religion 
 rather than being a source of hope and spiritual healing is abused as a call to 
 arms as God is dragged once again onto the field of battle 
 It is time to reclaim religion from those who have made it a weapon rather than a 
 shelter It is time to reclaim education from those who use it as a tool of hate 
 rather than an opportunity As always the most powerful form of education and 
 the hardest is to  can not expect our younger generation to 
 value what we are not prepared ourselves to protect and pay a price for And there 
 is a price to pay From the leader who has to withstand public pressures From the 
 businessman who has to forgo economic opportunity From the teacher and 
 spiritual guide who must find the inner strength to teach truth and tolerance in a 
 climate of extremism and hostility At all levels of society there is a price to be 
 paid But if we do not pay it today we and those who follow us will face a far 
 greater bill tomorrow 
 These thoughts are in my mind as we seek today to advance the cause of 
 Israeli Palestinian reconciliation Reconciliation is not about deciding who was 
 right or who was wrong in the past it is about sharing a common vision and a 
 common responsibility for the future In the last months Prime Minister Olmert 
 and President Abbas have been engaged in a sincere and genuine effort to reach 
 the widest possible common ground on political understandings There is no 
 substitute for the bilateral process Failure is not an option but it is for the parties 
 themselves to define success The foundation for true peace lies in the vision of 
 two States Israel and Palestine living   The 
 world shares this vision but it is also important that it clearly embrace the two 
 core principles that emerge from it 
 The first of these principles is two States two homelands Just as Israel is 
 homeland to the Jewish people so Palestine will be established as the homeland 
 and the national answer for the Palestinian people including the refugees 
 The second is living   Just as a viable and 
 prosperous Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza is an Israeli interest so must a 
 secure Israel be a Palestinian interest The world can not afford another terror 
 State 
 the parties can define a common border and turn the 
 two State vision from a dream into reality To succeed we must set our sights on 
 a brighter future while responding to the challenges of the present and learning 
 the lessons of the past As we make progress on concrete political understandings 
 it is just as important to change the reality on the ground to show Palestinians 
 and Israelis that the promise of peace exists in practice not just on paper 
 In recent months Israel has taken tangible measures to create a better 
 environment and we are ready to do more We know that Palestinian life is full of 
 day to day hardship We know also and only too well the burden of terror that 
 Israelis bear and of our primary obligation to their security Together we can 
 change this reality we do not need to submit to it 
 We are not naive We can see the difficulties ahead and the enemies of peace that 
 stand in our way But practical progress is possible in those areas where there is 
 an effective Palestinian Government that accepts the Quartet ’s principles and 
 implements alongside Israel the existing Road Map obligations 
 As the parties take the risks for peace we look to the international community and 
 the Arab and Muslim world to offer support not to stipulate conditions This 
 support comes in many forms It comes through economic and political assistance 
 to the new Palestinian Government committed to coexistence and seeking to build 
 the foundations of a peaceful and prosperous State It comes through the clear 
 endorsement of any political understandings reached between the parties It 
 comes through enhancing and deepening regional ties and cooperation between 
 the Arab world and Israel while in parallel we advance towards Israeli Palestinian 
 peace And finally it   determined to prevent us from 
 succeeding 
 We must stand up to those who have no respect for human life or human liberty 
 those who hold captive soldiers Gilad Shalit Udi Goldwasser and Eldad Regev 
 whose families are with us today and whose pain remains always in our hearts 
 We must stand up to those who after we withdrew from Gaza to give peace a 
 chance chose not to build but to destroy and who choose on a daily basis to 
 target Israeli homes and kindergartens with their missiles 
 And we must stand up to those who see democracy as a tool to advance hate who 
 see tolerance as a one way street and who see education as a means of poisoning 
 the minds of the next generation 
 I believe that despite all the obstacles there is a new moment of opportunity and 
 an alliance of interest that favors peace Time is of the essence We owe it to 
 ourselves and to our children to find both the courage and the wisdom to make the 
 right choices in the right way 
 On this festival of Sukkot Jews commemorate the journey from slavery to 
  homes to live in fragile huts like the shelters in which 
 our ancestors lived on their way to the Promised Land For 3,000 years these 
 temporary huts open to the elements have been a reminder that stability and 
 security are ensured not   that we build but also by the 
 values that we share Perhaps it is for this reason that the Sukkah this fragile 
 shelter has become the Jewish symbol of peace 
 We turn to Jerusalem and say in our prayers every day Spread over us the canopy 
 of your peace May it be in our days and for all nations",0.2923499941825866,0.0473247691988945,0.4503935575485229,0.0051317005418241,0.1839274615049362,0.0181986950337886,0.0026738343294709,0.0391341314935065,0.3940629058441558,51.35902981183406,0.3068105192178018,0.014357501794687724,0.0929054054054054,0.054204862495017936,25.796296296296298,0.0
88,Samantha Power,Address on Overcoming UN Resolution 3379,2015," Thank you all I do n't know what 's worse following John Kerry or Daniel Patrick 
 Moynihan 
 But let me   people who have organized this amazing event 
 and my friends and partners David Harris thank you for always having the best 
 ideas and being such a tremendous partner Isaac Herzog it 's a great honor and 
 privilege to meet you and thank you for being so principled on behalf of peace 
 Danny Danon thank you it 's great to get to know you and thank you also for your 
 team because it is teamwork that allows us to fight what goes on here every day 
 Secretary Kerry had to leave so I can say behind his back as it were what I was 
 going to say to him in person But he is just the most tremendous co conspirator a 
 person can have and he has two qualities that I think are totally defining one he 
 is completely sincere and authentic in his convictions and in what he says He is 
 completely he 's the most sincere person I think I 've ever known And second 
 he never ever gives up So if anybody else is tempted to give up you will not get 
 company in him 
 I 'm very honored to just be a part of this and particularly amongst such a 
 distinguished group I should also thank the Secretary General of course for 
 always being willing to get on a plane and to invest himself if he can improve or 
 save lives It 's the sine qua non 
 We are marking two somber anniversaries here today One of course is the UN 
 General Assembly vote 40 years ago branding Zionism as a form of racism 
 The other is Kristallnacht the night of the broken glass 77 years ago 
 Kristallnacht was not a night it was several days of violence targeting Jews across 
 Germany Austria and the Sudetenland Synagogues were destroyed Jewish 
 homes schools and businesses looted at least 91 Jews were murdered 30,000 
 Jews deported to camps 
 In Baden Baden Jewish men and boys were rounded up and marched to the 
 synagogue where the SS forced them to remove their kippahs and read aloud 
 from sections of Mein Kampf beating those who refused to or who did not read 
 with enough enthusiasm After hours of this abuse the SS loaded the men onto 
 trucks to Dachau and burned down the synagogue Even the stones of the 
 synagogue 's foundation were broken up and used to pave a road 
 Speaking 40 years ago on the day UN Resolution 3379 was adopted Israel 's 
 ambassador to the UN Chaim Herzog who had himself as his son has shared 
 with us helped liberate Jews in concentration camps recognized the horrific 
 symmetry between these two events In both instances actions that should have 
 been a source of shame whether the horrific violence against Jews in 1938 or 
 the 1975 smearing of Jews aspirations to have a homeland became for certain 
 people a perverse source of pride And both were rooted in what Herzog called the 
 two evils of hatred and ignorance 
 As Herzog rightly recognized the proponents of the resolution not only discredited 
 themselves but they discredited the United Nations and the principles this 
 institution was supposed to defend He said The issue before this assembly is not 
 Israel and is not Zionism The issue is the fate of this organization Ambassador 
 Moynihan saw it the same way What we have at stake here is not merely the 
 honor and the legitimacy of the State of Israel he said but the integrity of the 
 whole body of moral and legal precepts which we know as human rights That 
 such a poisonous idea could be not only discussed in the United Nations but given 
 its imprimatur called into question the moral authority and legitimacy of this 
 institution 
 But just as important as what Herzog and Moynihan said on that day of the 
 infamous vote was what they and others did after it fighting for the principles 
 that they knew to be right Chaim Herzog 's speech marked the beginning of a 
 movement and it 's really important to bear that in mind I just want to touch in 
 my very brief remarks on two things that happened next 
 First Herzog and Israelis continued as they had been dedicating themselves 
 to the enduring project of building the State of Israel what Herzog described as 
 our attempt to build a society imperfect though it may be and what society is 
 perfect in which the visions of the prophets of Israel will be realized In other 
 words Israel 's most powerful rebuttal to Zionism is racism was showing how 
 Israel 's aspirations as a nation aligned with the principles at the heart of the UN 
 Charter Herzog did more than tear apart the General Assembly 's resolution with 
 his hands and with his arguments he helped build a vibrant and democratic 
 Israel an effort that his son who spoke with us earlier is nobly carrying forward 
 to this day And just as Herzog could count on Moynihan 's searing condemnation 
 of Resolution 3379 in the General Assembly so too over the years could Israel 
 count on the United States as it has since its creation and does to this day as 
 its strongest partner at the United Nations and in the world   That bond as we 
 know was underscored this week when President Obama and Prime Minister 
 Netanyahu reaffirmed their shared commitment to the vision of two states for two 
 peoples living 
 Now the second part of the aftermath that bears noting is the United States 
 Israel and our collective partners worked relentlessly for that decade and a half 
 to build up the support to revoke this resolution that had cast such a stain on this 
 institution and on so much else And while the history of the resolution 's adoption 
 and these incredible speeches is well known the story of its overturning is not In 
 this country it was a campaign led   community members of 
 Congress and successive administrations from both parties And their effort 
 succeeded not only because they were persistent but also because they 
 methodically set about winning over governments on the opposite side one by 
 one targeted   And that 's what it takes as we 
 know to this day 
 Herzog and Moynihan understood the critical importance of winning over this 
 international support and they personally played a crucial role over the years in 
 getting their governments to use every tool in their tool boxes to shift the 
 positions of those countries that had voted for this horrific text Herzog from the 
 Knesset and eventually as President of Israel and Moynihan from the U.S. Senate 
 To just give you one example when in 1985 the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly 
 adopted a resolution condemning the UN 's proclamation of Zionism is racism as 
 what it called a permanent smear upon the United Nations the members of 
 Congress included language exhorting the parliaments in other countries to adopt 
 similar condemnatory resolutions 
 Their relentless pressure and that of so many of their stalwart allies including 
 many in this room today culminated in 1991 when then President George H.W. 
 Bush told world leaders1 gathered at the General Assembly that the resolution 
 mocked the UN 's principles and the United Nations will 
 enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace American diplomats then 
 made a final push in capitals across the world which helped to swing some of the 
 countries that were still remarkably on the fence When a vote was called in 
 December of that year 1991 111 nations voted to revoke the resolution including 
 many who had originally voted for it only 25 countries voted to keep it in place 
 25 too many Only one time before in the then history of the UN had a UN 
 resolution been revoked and it has never happened since So it is worth 
 remarking on that as well as the outrage of the event itself that we are 
 commemorating tonight 
 Let me conclude When the UN adopted resolution 3379 Moynihan declared that 
 a great evil had been loosed on the world To be sure there have been 
 meaningful victories over that evil since 1975 as in January of just this year 
 when we joined Israel the EU and Canada in co sponsoring the first ever UN 
 General Assembly meeting on anti Semitism On that day in the very same hall 
 in the very same chamber you saw in those videos tonight where 72 countries had 
 branded Zionism as a form of racism more than 50 nations denounced 
 anti Semitism and vowed to take steps to address it We also see victories 
 modest victories but victories in Israel 's growing inclusion in UN bodies from 
 which it has long been unjustly excluded which as you all know has not come 
 without a fight and it is a fight we continue to wage together with our Israeli 
 counterparts every single day 
 But for all of this and again these are really important to note as well as the 
 outrages we are very far from vanquishing anti Semitism Indeed as we know it 
 is on the rise in so many parts of the world Even in Ireland even in our Ireland 
 where Herzog and I were both born and spent our childhood years a plaque 
 marking the site of Herzog 's Belfast birthplace was taken down last year after the 
 building where it was placed was repeatedly defaced with anti Israel graffiti and 
 where objects were routinely thrown at it What more do you need as a testament 
 to how far we have left to go Additionally here in the halls of the UN rarely a day 
  effort to delegitimize Israel or to unjustly exclude it from 
 what for all other countries is just business as usual We will never stop fighting 
 for Israel to achieve a very simple goal here which is to be treated like every 
 other country 
 And it remains as true today as it was 40 years ago that the enduring bias not only 
 threatens Israel but threatens the legitimacy of the UN So as we continue to 
 confront these dual evils of hatred and ignorance and confront them we must 
 and confront them we will we would do well to learn from Herzog and Moynihan 
 If we bring the same moral clarity that they so eloquently expressed four decades 
 ago if we relentlessly fight back against ignorance and hatred of all forms in our 
 nations and in international institutions like this one and if we continue to work to 
 win over other people and governments to our just causes as Herzog and 
 Moynihan never stopped doing long after these speeches then we will bring 
 our nations and the United Nations closer to living up to their ideals

89,Sarah Palin,Republican Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech,2008," Mr. Chairman delegates and fellow citizens I will be honored to accept your 
 nomination for Vice President of the United States 
 I accept the call to help our nominee for President to serve and defend America 
 and I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election against confident 
 opponents at a crucial hour for our country And I accept the privilege of serving 
 with a man who has come through much harder missions and met far graver 
 challenges and knows how tough fights are won the next President of the 
 United States John S. McCain 
 It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our 
 nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the 
 country he loves With their usual certitude they told us that all was lost there 
 was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than 
 see his country lose a war 
 But the pollsters the pollsters and the pundits they overlooked just one thing 
 when they wrote him off They overlooked the caliber of the man himself the 
 determination and resolve and the sheer guts of Senator John McCain 
 The voters knew better And maybe that 's because they realize there ’s a time for 
 politics and a time for leadership a time to campaign and a time to put our 
 country first 
 Our nominee for President is a true profile in courage and people like that are 
 hard to come by He 's a man who wore the uniform of his country for 22 years 
 and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who now have brought victory 
 within sight 
 And as the mother of one of those troops that is exactly the kind of man I want as 
 commander in chief Thank you I 'm just one of many moms who 'll say an extra 
 prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm 's way 
 Our son Track is 19 And one week from tomorrow September 11th he 'll 
 deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country My nephew 
 Kasey also enlisted and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf My family is so 
 proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in 
 uniform 
 So Track is the eldest of our five children In our family it 's two boys and three 
 girls in between my strong and kind hearted daughters Bristol and Willow and 
 Piper And we were so blessed in April Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into 
 the world a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig You know from the inside 
 no family ever seems typical and that 's how it is with us Our family has the same 
 ups and downs as any other the same challenges and the same joys   Sometimes 
 even the greatest joys bring challenge 
 And children with special needs inspire a very very special love To the families of 
 special needs To the families of special needs children all across this country I 
 have a message for you For years you ’ve sought to make America a more 
 welcoming place for your sons and daughters   And I pledge to you that if we ’re 
 elected you will have a friend and advocate in the White House 
 And Todd is a story  's a lifelong commercial fisherman and a 
 production operator in the oil fields of Alaska 's North Slope and a proud member 
 of the United Steel Workers Union and Todd is a world champion snow machine 
 racer Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry and it all makes for quite a package 
 And we met in high school and two decades and five children later he 's still my 
 guy 
 My Mom and Dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town And 
 among the many things I owe them is a simple lesson that I ’ve learned that this 
 is America and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity And my 
 parents are here tonight I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally 
 Heath 
 Long ago a young farmer and a habber dasher from Missouri he followed an 
 unlikely path he followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency And a writer 
 observed We grow good people in our small towns with honesty and sincerity 
 and dignity And I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he 
 praised Harry Truman I grew up with those people They ’re the ones who do some 
 of the hardest work in America who grow our food and run our factories and 
 fight our wars They love their country in good times and bad and they 're always 
 proud of America I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town 
 I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA I love those 
 hockey moms You know they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit 
 bull   lipstick So I signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids 
 public education even better And when I ran for city council I did n't need focus 
 groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters and I knew their families 
 too 
 Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska I was mayor of my 
 hometown And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look 
 down on that experience let me explain to them what the job involves I guess 
 I guess a small town mayor is sort of like a community organizer except that 
 you have actual responsibilities I might add I might add that in small towns we 
 do n't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working 
 people when they ’re listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their 
 religion and guns when those people are n't listening No we tend to prefer 
 candidates who do n't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San 
 Francisco As for my running mate you can be certain that wherever he goes and 
 whoever is listening John McCain is the same man 
 Well I 'm not a member of the permanent political establishment And I 've learned 
 quickly these last few days that if you 're not a member in good standing of the 
 Washington elite then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that 
 reason alone But but no here 's a little news flash no here ’s a little news 
 flash for those reporters and commentators I 'm not going to Washington to seek 
 their good opinion I 'm going to Washington to serve the people of this great 
 country Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reason and not 
 just to mingle with the right people 
 Politics is n't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests The right 
 reason is to challenge the status quo to serve the common good and to leave this 
 nation better than we found it No one expects us all to agree on everything But 
 we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and 
 a servant 's heart 
 And I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as Vice 
 President of the United States This was the spirit that brought me to the 
 governor 's office when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau when I stood 
 up to the special interests and the lobbyists and the big oil companies and the 
 good ol' boys Suddenly I realized that sudden and relentless reform never sits 
 well with entrenched interests and power brokers That 's why true reform is so 
 hard to achieve 
 But with the support of the citizens of Alaska we shook things up And in short 
 order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people I came to 
 office promising major ethics reform to end the culture of self dealing And today 
 that ethics reform is the law 
 While I was at it I got rid of a few things in the governor 's office that I did n't 
 believe our citizens should have to pay for That luxury jet was over the top I put 
 it on eBay I love to drive myself to work And I thought we could muddle through 
 without the governor 's personal chef although I 've got to admit that sometimes 
 my kids sure miss her I came to office promising to control spending by request 
 if possible   necessary 
 Senator McCain also he promises to use the power of veto in defense of the 
 public interest and as a chief executive I can assure you it works 
 Our state budget is under control We have a surplus And I have protected the 
  spending nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes We 
 suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of 
 earmark spending by Congress 
 I told the Congress thanks but no thanks on that Bridge to Nowhere If our 
 state wanted to build a bridge we were going to build it ourselves When oil and 
 gas prices went up dramatically and filled up the state treasury I sent a large 
 share of that revenue back where it belonged directly to the people of Alaska 
 And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists who kinda liked things 
 the way that they were we broke their monopoly on power and resources 
 As governor I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of 
 our state and return it to the people I fought to bring about the largest 
 private sector infrastructure project in North American history And when that 
 deal was struck we began a nearly forty billion dollar natural gas pipeline to help 
 lead America to energy independence That pipeline when the last section is laid 
 and its valves are opened will lead America one step farther away from 
 dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart 
 The stakes for our nation could not be higher When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf 
 of Mexico this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we ’re 
 forced to draw from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve And families can not throw 
 more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil With Russia wanting to 
 control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus and to divide and intimidate our European 
  as a weapon we can not leave ourselves at the mercy of 
 foreign suppliers 
 To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of the world ’s 
 energy supplies or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in 
 Saudi Arabia or that Venezuela might shut off its oil discoveries and its 
 deliveries of that source Americans we need to produce more of our own oil and 
 gas And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska we 've got lots of 
 both 
 Our opponents say again and again that drilling will not solve all of America 's 
 energy problems as if we did n't know that already But the fact the fact that 
 drilling though wo n't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all 
 Starting in January in a McCain Palin Administration we 're going to lay more 
 pipelines and build more nuclear plants and create jobs with clean coal and 
 move forward on solar wind geothermal and other alternative sources 
 We need We need American sources of resources we need American energy 
 brought to and 
 And now I 've noticed a pattern with our opponent And maybe you have too 
 We 've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers 
 And there is much to like and admire about our opponent But listening to him 
 speak it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not 
 a single major law or even a reform not even in the state senate 
 This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting 
 and never use the word victory except when he 's talking about his own 
 campaign But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed when the roar of the crowd 
 fades away when the stadium lights go out and those Styrofoam Greek columns 
 are hauled back to some studio lot when that happens what exactly is our 
 opponent 's plan What does he actually seek to accomplish after he 's done 
 turning back the waters and healing the planet The answer The answer is to 
 make government bigger and take more of your money and give you more orders 
 from Washington and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world 
 America needs more energy our opponent is against producing it 
 Victory in Iraq is finally in sight and he wants to forfeit Terrorist states are 
 seeking nuclear weapons without delay he wants to meet them without 
 preconditions Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America 
 and he 's worried that someone wo n't read em their rights 
 Government is too big He wants to grow it Congress spends too much money He 
 promises more Taxes are too high and he wants to raise them His tax increases 
 are the fine print in his economic plan and let me be specific 
 The Democratic nominee for President supports plans to raise income taxes and 
 raise payroll taxes and raise investment income taxes and raise the death tax 
 and raise business taxes and increase the tax burden on the American people by 
 hundreds of billions of dollars 
 My sister Heather and her husband they just built a service station that 's now 
 opened for business like millions of others who run small businesses How are 
 they how are they going to be better off if taxes go up Or maybe you are trying 
 to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or in Ohio or you ’re trying you ’re trying 
 to create jobs from clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia or you ’re trying 
 to keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota How are you how are 
 you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the 
 American economy 
 Here 's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election In politics there 
 are some candidates who use change to promote their careers And then there are 
 those like John McCain who use their careers to promote change They are the 
 ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms not just on buttons and 
 banners or on self designed presidential seals 
 Among politicians there is the idealism of high flown speechmaking in which 
 crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things And then there is the 
 idealism of those leaders like John McCain who actually do great things They 're 
 the ones who are good for more than talk the ones that we ’ve always been able to 
 count on to serve and to defend America Senator McCain 's record of actual 
 achievements and reform helps explain why so many special interests and 
 lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the 
 prospect of a McCain presidency from the primary election of 2000 to this very 
 day 
 Our nominee does n't run with the Washington herd He 's a man who 's there to 
 serve his country and not just his party A leader who 's not looking for a fight but 
 sure is n’t afraid of one either Harry Reid the Majority of the current do nothing 
 Senate he not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee He said 
 quote I ca n't stand John McCain Ladies and gentlemen perhaps no accolade we 
 hear this week is better proof that we 've chosen the right man Clearly what the 
 Majority Leader was driving at is that he ca n't stand up to John McCain And that 
 is only that ’s only one more reason to take the maverick out of the Senate put 
 him in the White House 
 My fellow citizens the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of 
 personal discovery This world of threats and dangers it ’s not just a community 
 and it does n't just need an organizer And though both Senator Obama and 
 Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always quote 
 fighting for you let us face the matter squarely 
 There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you There is 
 only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you in places where 
 winning means survival and defeat means death and that man is John McCain 
 You know in our day politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of 
 adversity than the nightmare world the nightmare world in which this man and 
 others equally brave served and suffered for their country And it 's a long way 
 from the fear and pain and squalor of a  in Hanoi to the Oval Office 
 But if Senator McCain is elected President that is the journey he will have made 
 It 's the journey of an upright and honorable man the kind of fellow whose name 
 you will find on war memorials in small towns across this great country only he 
 was among those who came home 
 To the most powerful office on earth he would bring the compassion that comes 
 from having once been powerless the wisdom that comes even to the captives by 
 the grace of God the special confidence of those who have seen evil and have 
 seen how evil is overcome 
 A fellow A fellow prisoner of war a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster Ohio 
 Tom Moe recalls looking through a pin hole in his cell door as Lieutenant 
 Commander John McCain was led down the  day after day 
 And the story is told When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations 
 he would turn toward Moe 's door and he ’d flash a grin and a thumbs up as if to 
 say We 're gon na pull through this My fellow Americans that is the kind of man 
 America needs to see us through the next four years For a season a gifted 
 speaker can inspire with his words But for a lifetime John McCain has inspired 
 with his deeds 
 If character is the measure in this election and hope the theme and change the 
 goal we share then I ask you to join our cause Join our cause and help America 
 elect a great man as the next President of the United States 
 Thank you and God bless America Thank you",0.0092145316302776,0.0095718167722225,0.0030715956818312,0.826642632484436,0.1300577521324157,0.0151110971346497,0.0063306367956101,0.157633712905452,0.5084571256038649,66.69667410714285,0.2771084337349397,0.015265200517464425,0.11370620774431468,0.04713412860052371,24.30817610062893,0.0
90,Tony Blair,Address at the Labour Party Conference,2001," In retrospect the Millennium marked only a moment in time It was the events of 
 September 11 that marked a turning point in history where we confront the 
 dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind It was a tragedy 
 An act of evil From this nation goes our deepest sympathy and prayers for the 
 victims and our profound solidarity with the American people We were with you 
 at the first We will stay with you to the last 
 Just two weeks ago in New York after the church service I met some of the 
 families of the British victims It was in many ways a very British occasion Tea 
 and biscuits It was raining outside Around the edge of the room strangers 
 making small talk trying to be normal people in an abnormal situation And as you 
 crossed the room you felt the longing and sadness hands clutching photos of 
 sons and daughters wives and husbands imploring you to believe them when 
 they said there was still an outside chance of their loved ones being found alive 
 when you knew in truth that all hope was gone 
 And then a middle aged mother looks you in the eyes and tells you her only son 
 has died and asks you why I tell you you do not feel like the most powerful 
 person in the country at times like that Because there is no answer There is no 
 justification for their pain Their son did nothing wrong The woman seven months 
 pregnant whose child will never know its father did nothing wrong They do n't 
 want revenge They want something better in memory of their loved ones 
 I believe their memorial can and should be greater than simply the punishment of 
 the guilty It is that out of the shadow of this evil should emerge lasting good 
 destruction of the machinery of terrorism wherever it is found hope amongst all 
 nations of a new beginning where we seek to resolve differences in a calm and 
 ordered way greater understanding between nations and between faiths and 
 above all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed so that people 
 everywhere can see the chance of a better future through the hard work and 
 creative power of the free citizen not the violence and savagery of the fanatic 
 I know that here in Britain people are anxious even a little frightened I 
 understand that People know we must act but they worry what might follow They 
 worry about the economy and talk of recession And of course there are dangers 
 it is a new situation But the fundamentals of the US British and European 
 economies are strong Every reasonable measure of internal security is being 
 undertaken Our way of life is a great deal stronger and will last a great deal 
 longer than the actions of fanatics small in number and now facing a unified world 
 against them People should have confidence This is a battle with only one 
 outcome our victory not theirs 
 What happened on 11 September was without parallel in the bloody history of 
 terrorism Within a few hours up to 7000 people were annihilated the commercial 
 centre of New York was reduced to rubble and in Washington and Pennsylvania 
 further death and horror on an unimaginable scale Let no one say this was a blow 
 for Islam when the blood of innocent Muslims was shed along with those of the 
 Christian Jewish and other faiths around the world 
 We know those responsible In Afghanistan are scores of training camps for the 
 export of terror Chief amongst the sponsors and organizers is Usama Bin Laden 
 He is supported shielded and given   regime Two days before 
 the 11 September attacks Masood the leader of the opposition Northern Alliance 
 was   bombers Both were linked to Bin Laden Some 
 may call that coincidence I call it payment payment in the currency these people 
 deal in blood Be in no doubt Bin Laden and his people organized this atrocity 
 The Taliban aid and abet him He will not desist from further acts of terror They 
 will not stop helping him Whatever the dangers of the action we take the dangers 
 of inaction are far far greater 
 Look for a moment at the Taliban regime It is undemocratic That goes without 
 saying There is no sport allowed or television or photography No art or culture is 
 permitted All other faiths all other interpretations of Islam are ruthlessly 
 suppressed Those who practice their faith are imprisoned Women are treated in a 
 way almost too revolting to be credible First driven out of university girls not 
 allowed to go to school no legal rights unable to go out of doors without a man 
 Those that disobey are stoned There is now no contact permitted with western 
 agencies even those delivering food The people live in abject poverty It is a 
 regime founded on fear and funded on the drugs trade The biggest drugs hoard in 
 the world is in Afghanistan   Ninety per cent of the heroin 
 on British streets originates in Afghanistan The arms the Taliban are buying today 
 are paid for with the lives of young British people buying their drugs on British 
 streets That is another part of their regime that we should seek to destroy 
 So what do we do Do n't overreact some say We are n't We have n't lashed out 
 No missiles on the first night just for effect Do n't kill innocent people We are not 
 the ones who waged war on the innocent We seek the guilty Look for a 
 diplomatic solution There is no diplomacy with Bin Laden or the Taliban regime 
 State an ultimatum and get their response We stated the ultimatum they have n't 
 responded Understand the causes of terror Yes we should try but let there be no 
 moral ambiguity about this nothing could ever justify the events of 11 September 
 and it is to turn justice on its head to pretend it could The action we take will be 
 proportionate targeted we will do all we humanly can to avoid civilian casualties 
 But understand what we are dealing with Listen to the calls of those passengers 
 on the planes Think of the children on them told they were going to die Think of 
 the cruelty beyond our comprehension as amongst the screams and the anguish of 
 the innocent those hijackers drove at full throttle planes laden with fuel into 
 buildings where tens of thousands worked They have no moral inhibition on the 
 slaughter of the innocent If they could have murdered not 7,000 but 70,000 does 
 anyone doubt they would have done so and rejoiced in it There is no compromise 
 possible with such people no meeting of minds no point of understanding with 
 such terror Just a choice defeat it or be  defeat it we must 
 Any action taken will be against the terrorist network of Bin Laden 
 As for the Taliban they can surrender the terrorists or face the consequences and 
 again in any action the aim will be to eliminate their military hardware cut off 
 their finances disrupt their supplies target their troops not civilians We will put 
 a trap around the regime I say to the Taliban surrender the terrorists or 
 surrender power It 's your choice We will take action at every level national and 
 international in the UN in G8 in the EU in Nato in every regional grouping in the 
 world to strike at international terrorism wherever it exists For the first time the 
 UN security council has imposed mandatory obligations on all UN members to cut 
 off terrorist financing and end safe havens for terrorists Those that finance terror 
 those who launder their money those that cover their tracks are every bit as 
 guilty as the fanatic who commits the final act 
 Here in this country and in other nations round the world laws will be changed 
 not to deny basic liberties but to prevent their abuse and protect the most basic 
 liberty of all freedom from terror New extradition laws will be introduced new 
 rules to ensure asylum is not a front for terrorist entry This country is proud of its 
 tradition in giving asylum to those fleeing tyranny We will always do so But we 
 have a duty to protect the system from abuse It must be overhauled radically so 
 that from now on those who   get help and those that do n't can 
 no longer play the system to gain unfair advantage over others Round the world 
 11 September is bringing Governments and people to reflect consider and change 
 And in this process amidst all the talk of war and action there is another 
 dimension appearing There is a coming together The power of community is 
 asserting itself We are realizing how fragile are our frontiers in the face of the 
 world 's new challenges 
 Today conflicts rarely stay within national boundaries Today a tremor in one 
 financial market is repeated in the markets of the world Today confidence is 
 global either its presence or its absence Today the threat is chaos because for 
 people with work to do family life to balance mortgages to pay careers to 
 further pensions to provide the yearning is for order and stability and if it does n't 
 exist elsewhere it is unlikely to exist here I have long believed this 
 interdependence defines the new world we live in 
 People say we are only acting because it 's the USA that was attacked Double 
 standards they say But when Milosevic embarked on the ethnic cleansing of 
 Muslims in Kosovo we acted The skeptics said it was pointless we 'd make 
 matters worse we 'd make Milosevic stronger and look what happened we won 
 the refugees went home the policies of ethnic cleansing were reversed and one of 
 the great dictators of the last century will see justice in this century And I tell 
 you if Rwanda happened again today as it did in 1993 when a million people were 
 slaughtered in cold blood we would have a moral duty to act there also We were 
 there in Sierra Leone when a murderous group of gangsters threatened its 
 democratically elected Government and people And we as a country should and I 
 as Prime Minister do give thanks for the brilliance dedication and sheer 
 professionalism of the British Armed Forces 
 We ca n't do it all Neither can the Americans But the power of the international 
 community could together if it chose to It could with our help sort out the 
 blight that is the continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
 where three million people have died through war or famine in the last decade A 
 Partnership for Africa between the developed and developing world based around 
 the New African Initiative is there to be done if we find the will On our side 
 provide more aid untied to trade write off debt help with good governance and 
 infrastructure training to the soldiers with UN blessing in conflict resolution 
 encouraging investment and access to our markets so that we practise the free 
 trade we are so fond of preaching But it 's a deal on the African side true 
 democracy no more excuses for dictatorship abuses of human rights no 
 tolerance of bad governance from the endemic corruption of some states to the 
 activities of Mr. Mugabe 's henchmen in Zimbabwe Proper commercial legal and 
 financial systems 
 The will with our help to broker agreements for peace and provide troops to 
 police them The state of Africa is a scar on the conscience of the world But if the 
 world as a community focused on it we could heal it And if we do n't it will 
 become deeper and angrier We could defeat climate change if we chose to Kyoto 
 is right We will implement it and call upon all other nations to do so But it 's only 
 a start With imagination we could use or find the technologies that create energy 
 without destroying our planet we could provide work and trade without 
 deforestation If humankind was able finally to make industrial progress without 
 the factory conditions of the 19th Century surely we have the wit and will to 
 develop economically without despoiling the very environment we depend upon 
 And if we wanted to we could breathe new life into the Middle East Peace Process 
 and we must 
 The state of Israel must be given  from terror know that it 
 is accepted as part of the future of the Middle East not its very existence under 
 threat The Palestinians must have justice the chance to prosper and in their own 
 land as equal partners with Israel in that future We know that It is the only way 
 just as we know in our own peace process in Northern Ireland there will be no 
 unification of Ireland  there will be no return to the days of 
 unionist or Protestant supremacy because those days have no place in the modern 
 world So the unionists must accept justice and equality for nationalists The 
 Republicans must show they have given up violence not just a ceasefire but 
 weapons put beyond use And not only the Republicans but those people who call 
 themselves Loyalists but   terrorism sully the name of the United 
 Kingdom 
 We know this also The values we believe in should shine through what we do in 
 Afghanistan To the Afghan people we make this commitment The conflict will not 
 be the end We will not walk away as the outside world has done so many times 
 before If the Taliban regime changes we will work with you to make sure its 
 successor is one that is broad based that unites all ethnic groups and that offers 
 some way out of the miserable poverty that is your present existence And more 
 than ever now with every bit as much thought and planning we will assemble a 
 humanitarian coalition alongside the military coalition so that inside and outside 
 Afghanistan the refugees millions on the move even before September 11 are 
 given shelter food and help during the winter months The world community must 
 show as much its capacity for compassion as for force 
 The critics will say but how can the world be a community Nations act in their 
 own self interest Of course they do But what is the lesson of the financial 
 markets climate change international terrorism nuclear proliferation or world 
 trade It is that our self interest and our mutual interests are today inextricably 
 woven together This is the politics of globalisation I realize why people protest 
 against globalisation We watch aspects of it with trepidation We feel powerless 
 as if we were now pushed to and   But there 's a 
 risk that political leaders faced with street demonstrations pander to the 
 argument rather than answer it The demonstrators are right to say there 's 
 injustice poverty environmental degradation But globalisation is a fact and by 
 and large it is  just in finance but in communication in 
 technology increasingly in culture in recreation In the world of the internet 
 information technology and TV there will be globalisation And in trade the 
 problem is not there 's too much of it on the contrary there 's too little of it 
 The issue is not how to stop globalisation The issue is how we use the power of 
 community to combine it with justice If globalisation works only for the benefit of 
 the few then it will fail and will deserve to fail But if we follow the principles that 
 have served us so well at home that power wealth and opportunity must be in 
 the hands of the many not the few if we make that our guiding light for the 
 global economy then it will be a force for good and an international movement 
 that we should take pride in leading Because the alternative to globalisation is 
 isolation round the world nations are instinctively 
 drawing together In Quebec all the countries of North and South America 
 deciding to make one huge free trade area rivalling Europe In Asia In Europe 
 the most integrated grouping of all we are now 15 nations Another 12 countries 
 negotiating to join and more beyond that 
 A new relationship between Russia and Europe is beginning And will not India and 
 China each with three times as many citizens as the whole of the EU put together 
 once their economies have developed sufficiently as they will do not reconfigure 
 entirely the geopolitics of the world and in our lifetime That is why with 60 per 
 cent of our trade dependent on Europe three million jobs tied up with Europe 
 much of our political weight engaged in Europe it would be a fundamental denial 
 of our true national interest to turn our backs on Europe We will never let that 
 happen For 50 years Britain has uncharacteristically followed not led in Europe 
 At each and every step There are debates central to our future coming up how we 
 reform European economic policy how we take forward European defense how 
 we fight organized crime and terrorism Britain needs its voice strong in Europe 
 and bluntly Europe needs a strong Britain rock solid in our alliance with the USA 
 yet determined to play its full part in shaping Europe 's destiny 
 We should only be part of the single currency if the economic conditions are met 
 They are not window dressing for a political decision They are fundamental But if 
 they are met we should join and if met in this parliament we should have the 
 courage of our argument to ask the British people for their consent in this 
 Parliament Europe is not a threat to Britain Europe is an opportunity It is in 
 taking the best of the Anglo Saxon and European models of development that 
 Britain 's hope of a prosperous future lies The American spirit of enterprise the 
 European spirit of solidarity We have here also an opportunity Not just to build 
 bridges politically but economically 
 What is the answer to the current crisis Not isolationism but the world coming 
 together with America as a community What is the answer to Britain 's relations 
 with Europe Not opting out but being leading members of a community in which 
 in alliance with others we gain strength What is the answer to Britain 's future 
 Not each person for themselves but working together as a community to ensure 
 that everyone not just the privileged few get the chance to succeed This is an 
 extraordinary moment for progressive politics Our values are the right ones for 
 this age the power of community solidarity the collective ability to further the 
 individual 's interests 
 People ask me if I think ideology is dead My answer is In the sense of rigid forms 
 of economic and social theory yes The 20th century killed those ideologies and 
 their passing causes little regret But in the sense of a governing idea in politics 
 based on values no The governing idea of modern social democracy is 
 community Founded on the principles of social justice That people should rise 
 according to merit not birth that the test of any decent society is not the 
 contentment of the wealthy and strong but the commitment to the poor and 
 weak 
 But values are n't enough The mantle of leadership comes at a price the courage 
 to learn and change to show how values that stand for all ages can be applied in 
 a way relevant to each age Our politics only succeed when the realism is as clear 
 as the idealism 
 This party 's strength today comes from the journey of change and learning we 
 have made We learnt that however much we strive for peace we need strong 
 defence capability where a peaceful approach fails We learnt that equality is 
 about equal worth not equal outcomes Today our idea of society is shaped 
 around mutual responsibility a deal an agreement between citizens not a 
 one way gift from the well off to the dependent Our economic and social policy 
 today owes as much to the liberal social democratic tradition of Lloyd George 
 Keynes and Beveridge as to the socialist principles of the 1945 Government Just 
 over a decade ago people asked if Labour could ever win again Today they ask 
 the same question of the Opposition Painful though that journey of change has 
 been it has been worth it every stage of the way 
 On this journey the values have never changed The aims have n't Our aims would 
 be instantly recognizable to every Labour leader from Keir Hardie onwards But 
 the means do change The journey has n't ended It never ends The next stage for 
 New Labour is not backwards it is renewing ourselves again Just after the 
 election an old colleague of mine said Come on Tony now we 've won again 
 ca n't we drop all this New Labour and do what we believe in I said It 's worse 
 than you think I really do believe in it We did n't revolutionize British economic 
 policy Bank of England independence tough spending rules for some 
 managerial reason or as a clever wheeze to steal Tory clothes We did it because 
 the victims of economic incompetence 15 per cent interest rates 3 m unemployed 
 are hard working families They are the ones and even more so now with 
 tough times ahead that the economy should be run for not speculators or 
 currency dealers or senior executives whose pay packets do n't seem to bear any 
 resemblance to the performance of their companies 
 Economic competence is the pre condition of social justice We have legislated for 
 fairness at work like the minimum wage which people struggled a century for But 
 we wo n't give up the essential flexibility of our economy or our commitment to 
 enterprise Why Because in a world leaving behind mass production where 
 technology revolutionizes not just companies but whole industries almost 
 overnight enterprise creates the jobs people depend on We have boosted 
 pensions child benefit family incomes We will do more But our number one 
 priority for spending is and will remain education Why Because in the new 
 markets countries like Britain can only create   not low 
 wages and sweatshop labour We have cut youth unemployment by 75 per cent 
 By more than any government before us But we refuse to pay benefit to those 
 who refuse to work Why Because the welfare that works is welfare that helps 
 people to help themselves The graffiti the vandalism the burnt out cars the 
 street corner drug dealers the teenage mugger just graduating from the minor 
 school of crime we 're not old fashioned or right wing to take action against this 
 social menace 
 We 're standing up for the people we represent who   and have a 
 right to expect others to do the same And especially at this time let us say we 
 celebrate the diversity in our country get strength from the cultures and races 
 that go to make up Britain today and racist abuse and racist attacks have no place 
 in the Britain we believe in All these policies are   thread of 
 principle Now with this second term our duty is not to sit back and bask in it It is 
 across the board in competition policy enterprise pensions criminal justice the 
 civil service and of course public services to go still further in the journey of 
 change All for the same reason to allow us to deliver social justice in the modern 
 world 
 Public services are the power of community in action 
 They are social justice made real The child with a good education flourishes The 
 child given a poor education lives with it for the rest of their life How much talent 
 and ability and potential do we waste How many children never know not just the 
 earning power of a good education but the joy of art and culture and the 
 stretching of imagination and horizons which true education brings Poor 
 education is a personal tragedy and national scandal Yet even now with all the 
 progress of recent years a quarter of 11 year olds fail their basic tests and almost 
 a half of 16 year olds do n't get five decent GCSEs 
 The NHS meant that for succeeding generations anxiety was lifted from their 
 shoulders For millions who get superb treatment still the NHS remains the 
 ultimate symbol of social justice But for every patient waiting in pain that ca n't 
 get treatment for cancer or a heart condition or in desperation ends up paying for 
 their operation that patient 's suffering is the ultimate social injustice And the 
 demands on the system are ever greater Children need to be better and better 
 educated People live longer There is a vast array of new treatment available And 
 expectations are higher This is a consumer age People do n't take what they 're 
 given They demand more We 're not alone in this All round the world 
 governments are struggling with the same problems 
 So what is the solution Yes public services need more money We are putting in 
 the largest ever increases in NHS education and transport spending in the next 
 few years and on the police too We will keep to those spending plans And I say 
 in all honesty to the country if we want that to continue and the choice is 
 between investment and tax cuts then investment must come first   There is a 
 simple truth we all know For decades there has been chronic under investment in 
 British public services Our historic mission is to put that right and the historic 
 shift   of June 7 was that investment to provide quality 
 public services for all comprehensively defeated short term tax cuts for the few 
 We need better pay and conditions for the staff better incentives for recruitment 
 and for retention We 're getting them and recruitment is rising This year for the 
 first time in nearly a decade public sector pay will rise faster than private sector 
 pay And we are the only major government in Europe this year to be increasing 
 public spending on health and education as a percentage of our national income 
 This Party believes in public services believes in the ethos of public service and 
 believes in the dedication the vast majority of public servants show and the proof 
 of it is that we 're spending more hiring more and paying more than ever before 
 Public servants do n't do it for money or glory They do it because they find 
 fulfillment in a child well taught or a patient well cared for or a community made 
 safer and we salute them for it All that is true But this is also true That often 
 they work in systems and structures that are hopelessly old fashioned or even 
 worse work against the very goals they aim for There are schools with exactly 
 the same social intake One does well the other badly There are hospitals with 
 exactly the same patient mix One performs well the other badly 
 Without reform more money and pay wo n't succeed First we need a national 
 framework of accountability inspection and minimum standards of delivery 
 Second within that framework we need to free up local leaders to be able to 
 innovate develop and be creative   Third there should be far greater flexibility in 
 the terms and conditions of employment of public servants Fourth there has to be 
 choice for the user of public services and the ability where provision of the service 
 fails to have an alternative provider If schools want to develop or specialize in a 
 particular area or hire classroom assistants or computer professionals as well as 
 teachers let them If in a Primary Care Trust doctors can provide minor surgery 
 or physiotherapists see patients otherwise referred to a consultant let them 
 There are too many old demarcations especially between nurses doctors and 
 consultants too little use of the potential of new technology too much 
 bureaucracy too many outdated practices too great an adherence to the way 
 we 've always done it rather than the way public servants would like to do it if they 
 got the time to think and the freedom to act   It 's not reform that is the enemy of 
 public services It 's the status quo Part of that reform programme is partnership 
 with the private or voluntary sector Let 's get one thing clear Nobody is talking 
 about privatizing the NHS or schools Nobody believes the private sector is a 
 panacea 
 There are great examples of public service and poor examples There are excellent 
 private sector companies and poor ones There are areas where the private sector 
 has worked well and areas where as with parts of the railways it 's been a 
 disaster Where the private sector is used it should not make a profit simply by 
 cutting the wages and conditions of its staff But where the private sector can help 
 lever in vital capital investment where it helps raise standards where it improves 
 the public service as a public service then to set up some dogmatic barrier to 
 using it is to let down the very people who most need our public services to 
 improve This program of reform is huge in the NHS education including student 
 finance we have to find a better way to combine state funding and student 
 contributions criminal justice and transport I regard it as being as important for 
 the country as Clause IV 's reform was for the Party and obviously far more 
 important for the lives of the people we serve 
 And it is a vital test for the modern Labour Party If people lose faith in public 
 services be under no illusion as to what will happen There is a different approach 
 waiting in the wings Cut public spending drastically let those that can afford to 
 buy their own services and those that ca n't will depend on a demoralised sink 
 public service That would be a denial of social justice on a massive scale It would 
 be contrary to the very basis of community So this is a battle of values Let 's have 
 that battle but not amongst ourselves The real fight is between those who believe 
 in strong public services and those who do n't That 's the fight worth having 
 In all of this at home and abroad the same beliefs throughout that we are a 
 community of people whose self interest and mutual interest at crucial points 
 merge and that it is through a sense of justice that community is born and 
 nurtured And what does this concept of justice consist of Fairness people all of 
 equal worth of course But also reason and tolerance Justice has no favorites not 
 amongst nations peoples or faiths When we act to bring to account those that 
 committed the atrocity of September 11 we do so not out of bloodlust 
 We do so because it is just We do not act against Islam The true followers of 
 Islam are our brothers and sisters in this struggle Bin Laden is no more obedient 
 to the proper teaching of the Koran than those Crusaders of the 12th century who 
 pillaged and murdered represented the teaching of the Gospel It is time the west 
 confronted its ignorance of Islam Jews Muslims and Christians are all children of 
 Abraham This is the moment to bring the faiths closer together in understanding 
 of our common values and heritage a source of unity and strength It is time also 
 for parts of Islam to confront prejudice against America and not only Islam but 
 parts of western societies too 
 America has its faults as a society as we have ours But I think of the Union of 
 America born out of the defeat of slavery   I think of its Constitution with its 
 inalienable rights granted to every citizen still a model for the world I think of a 
 black man born in poverty who became chief of their armed forces and is now 
 secretary of state Colin Powell and I wonder frankly whether such a thing could 
 have happened here I think of the Statue of Liberty and how many refugees 
 migrants and the impoverished passed its light and felt that if not for them for 
 their children a new world could indeed be theirs I think of a country where 
 people who do well do n't have questions asked about their accent their class 
 their beginnings but have admiration for what they have done and the success 
 they 've achieved I think of those New Yorkers I met still in shock but resolute 
 the fire fighters and police mourning their comrades but still head held high I 
 think of all this and I reflect yes America has its faults but it is a free country a 
 democracy it is our ally and some of the reaction to September 11 betrays a 
 hatred of America that shames those that feel it 
 So I believe this is a fight for freedom And I want to make it a fight for justice 
 too Justice not only to punish the guilty But justice to bring those same values of 
 democracy and freedom to people round the world And I mean freedom not only 
 in the narrow sense of personal liberty but in the broader sense of each individual 
 having the economic and social freedom to develop their potential to the full That 
 is what community means founded on the equal worth of all The starving the 
 wretched the dispossessed the ignorant those living in want and squalor from 
 the deserts of Northern Africa to the slums of Gaza to the mountain ranges of 
 Afghanistan they too are our cause 
 This is a moment to seize The Kaleidoscope has been shaken The pieces are in 
 flux Soon they will settle again Before they do let us re order this world around 
 us Today humankind has the science and technology to destroy itself or to 
 provide prosperity to all Yet science ca n't make that choice for us Only the moral 
 power of a world acting as a community can By the strength of our common 
 endeavor we achieve more together than we can alone For those people who lost 
 their lives on September 11 and those that mourn them now is the time for the 
 strength to build that community Let that be their memorial",0.0086654424667358,0.0137018663808703,0.8171703219413757,0.0050871572457253,0.0338649712502956,0.1196388155221939,0.0018713981844484,0.0642552880723612,0.4011285151163199,58.755822393208206,0.2391653290529695,0.012519561815336464,0.08073896681491619,0.029057633649060846,18.946091644204852,0.0

92,Kyriakos Mitsotakis,Remarks at a U.S. Diplomatic Reception Event,2020," Thank you Thank you Vice President Pence Secretary of State Pompeo Ladies 
 and Gentlemen What a wonderful welcome I ’m deeply honored for this beautiful 
 reception and all the kind words you offered us 
 My wife Mareva and myself had you know 72 fantastic hours in the United 
 States We started with a beautiful trip to Florida to Tarpon Springs where we 
 saw firsthand how strong the Greek American community is There you go 
 And we had two very productive days of meetings in Washington at at the 
 White House on the Hill with American think tanks engaging with you potential 
 investors the Greek American community 
 You ’re absolutely right Mr. Vice President Secretary this relationship was never 
 stronger I am very proud to be leading Greece in these historic times for our 
 bilateral relations a relationship that can only go from strength to strength 
 And we had a chance during these two days to talk about a whole lot of issues 
 starting from the geopolitical situation in our region the challenges that we face I 
 was very glad to hear you reaffirming what should be a very obvious fact that 
 Greece was is and will remain the most reliable ally that the United States will 
 have in this part of the world 
 And we ’re convinced we 're convinced that the United States will stand by 
 Greece when it fights for its rights when it protects our own sovereign rights But 
 it will also   we look into the future as we focus on economic 
 growth creating prosperity for all Greeks 
 Mr. Vice President you ’re right to point out that when you cut taxes when you cut 
 red tape when you deregulate when you let entrepreneurship flourish very good 
 things happen to an economy It ’s the same it happened here It ’s also 
 happening in Greece And the Greek economy will grow from strength to strength 
 And we invite American investors to take part in this new chapter for our country 
 But this is also a story about shared values You ’re right to point out that the 
 Founding Fathers were very much   of classical Greece of 
 Athenian democracy And as we enter 2020 one should remember that this is also 
 an important date as we are celebrating 2,500 years from the historic battles of 
 Thermopylae and Salamis the battles that essentially allowed free Greece to 
 flourish and create the classical civilization which served as a basis of inspiration 
 for the entire world 
 But the Greek Founding Fathers of the Greek War of Independence the Greek 
 Revolution were also   Revolution and took faith in 
 what happened in the United States 40 years earlier 
 And next year is also a monumental date for Greece as we will be celebrating 200 
 years since the beginning of the Greek Revolution a story of courage a story of 
 freedom a story of a small people who rose in one corner of the Ottoman Empire 
 to establish the first free and independent state in this part of the world 
 And during those 200 years our country has gone through many adventures 
 We ’ve faced catastrophes and triumphs but hopefully we are now ready to write a 
 new chapter in our history And as we enter the third decade of the 21st century 
 I ’m sure this is going to be a decade of prosperity and of great success for my 
 country 
 So I would like once more to thank you for your kind hospitality I have to thank 
 everyone who ’s attending this beautiful reception in this historic building And let 
 me add one more toast again with ouzo to this most enduring and important 
 strategic friendship between Greece and the United States",0.0019778355490416,0.0016433871351182,0.00175920734182,0.9387813806533812,0.0401154719293117,0.0025055173318833,0.0132171902805566,0.2432140958456748,0.4405869471658945,56.86712303075771,0.3611111111111111,0.02384105960264901,0.13538461538461538,0.11475409836065574,24.35483870967742,0.0

94,Lyriq Turner,Address at the Gardere Martin Luther King Oratory Competition,2016," Good morning My name is Lyriq Turner and I 'm in the 5th grade 
 The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. left many legacies He was a crusader for 
 civil rights voting rights religious harmony peace and economic justice And 
 although Dr. King was not officially affiliated with any political party from his 
 writings and speeches we can conclude how he ’d respond to America ’s issues 
 If Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were running for President of the United States this 
 year what would he say 
 Standing upon the mountaintop of progress Dr. King would look over and see that 
 although the Jim Crow laws of yesteryear are long gone the trickle down 
 economics of the recent past has created a massive divide between the rich and 
 the poor 
 Dr. King would remind us to regard the poor but not through more government 
 handouts or other failed social policies   and stagnant 
 wages This will give the sluggish American economy a boost 
 America it is time for a new way 
 This new way can and must include a common sense approach to solving the 
 immigration issue By the year 2040 the total population will reflect a more 
 diverse multicultural society Dr. King would remind us to deal kindly with 
 strangers for we too were once strangers in this land You see it does n’t help to 
 build walls we need to build opportunity on both sides of the border 
 America it is time for a new way 
 This new way can and must take on a new approach to foreign affairs The fiery 
 darts such as ISIS will not soften America ’s resolve 
 America must take a proactive stance against those that seek to harm innocent 
 lives through cowardly acts of terror Every nation must overcome tribal racial 
 sectional and religious loyalties for the benefits of all humanity 
 America it is time for a new way 
 This new way can and must address a common sense approach to holding our 
 police accountable We must sit down  constructive dialogue about 
 the needs of our communit[ies remembering that all lives matter white 
 brown yellow and black 
 America it is time for a new way 
 It is time for a new way because the old way is broken It is time for a new way 
 because the old way alienates imprisons and traps us in an archaic way of living 
 moving and having our being In order to solve the problems of our era we must 
 set our moral compass high and let our actions typify the Son of Man and do the 
 right thing regardless of the earthly ramifications 
 So as we stand upon the mountaintop of progress 
 Let merit be our guiding light in every human resource office 
 Let compassion be our guiding light on every border and on every coast 
 Let diplomacy be our guiding light when we choose allies from around the world 
 Let service be our guiding light in the minds of every doctor teacher and police 
 officer 
 Through every walk of life let morality be our guiding light 
 When we let morality be our guiding light we will be able to speed up that day 
 when all children black white poor rich fatherless fathered citizen and 
 immigrant will be able to join hands and solve humanity ’s problems juntos 
 together 
 Some called him a preacher and a prophet a minister and a militant a 
 rabble rouser and a radical But what Dr. King would remind every presidential 
 candidate and every citizen is that America is still the Promised Land

95,SecDef James Mattis,Address at the Virginia Military Institute,2018," Well thank you Thank you very much all of you And we 'll see if you clap that 
 loud when I get done I might add We 'll see if I pass the grade here 
 But General Peay a former commander of mine thanks for the very kind 
 introduction I would just tell you I still remember the 101st over there well to 
 the left of the Marines 
 And there was nothing that could stop that unit as they closed in on MSR Main 
 Supply Route Newmarket I think I know where that name came from when we 
 saw it on the tactical maps 
 But I would also tell you that your fighting instinct permeated all the way down to 
 me years later as the regimental commander out in the Mojave when you came 
 out and reviewed the attack we made there 
 I would just say that with VMI blood running through your veins it 's great that 
 you followed your father 's footsteps as a cadet here and then have returned once 
 again 
 It builds a lot of my confidence as I think about what 's facing our country today 
 to know that someone what we call in the Naval service a shipmate is here 
 guiding this school today 
 One of the reasons I wanted to come here is I owe you a debt I owe this school a 
 debt because many many times I have had graduates of this school serve around 
 me above me under me and there is a debt that our country owes that goes back 
 many many decades as you know for a school that develops this sense of service 
 before self of putting others first 
 And that 's really what you come out of there with whether you 're going to serve 
 in the military or you 're going to serve your communities corporations whatever 
 But be a good corporate citizen 
 There 's an ethos that comes from living the way you 're  you 're 
  it 's good once in a while for someone who has no affiliation 
 with the school to   it because I also know this is not an 
 easy road that you 've chosen 
 I 've grown very remote from you young folks today who matter who carry so 
 much of our hopes on your young shoulders And I want to close that gap today to 
 the degree I can 
 And I would throw out some nuggets here I 'm going to talk for a few minutes 
 then we 're going to get to the good part which is of course the Q&A. 
 I think mostly I want to share my ideas on where your Department of Defense is 
 going General Peay did not serve in the Army he served in the U.S. Army 
 I did n't serve in the Marines Corps I served in the U.S. Marine Corps We 're 
 accountable to you and we are  if what we 're doing ca n't pass 
 your review then I need to hear it 
 And from what I ’ve heard this is not a shy audience so I look toward the 
 give and take and we 're always willing to put you into any boot camp immediately 
 if you irritate me okay That 's the way it 'll be 
 But each new generation I think turns to the past for some kind of strength and 
 inspiration I call it lighting the dark path ahead It 's why I did a lot of reading 
 It was also because the Marine Corps insisted I do a lot of reading I might add 
 and they were not there to help me through my midlife crisis when I came up 
 the reason why I had n't read the book that week 
 So they helped guide me through but also look for the role models who would 
 inspire me or show me how other people dealt with a similar situation I might 
 confront one day either successfully or unsuccessfully 
 I think it 's especially true in the military ranks we look for role models because 
 the roughest auditor in the world is going to audit your character your intellect 
 your physical fitness And that auditor of course is named War for those of you 
 who go off to fight for this country 
 This institution was actually established to develop the professional qualities and 
 the character to meet that auditor so you could meet them that auditor and 
 all of his challengers that he aligned with them on a battlefield you could meet 
 those challenges without confusion or hesitation when our country needed you 
 And since the Civil War every generation of America has turned to your graduates 
 to help keep alive what I call our experiment in democracy and that 's all it is 
 It 's one great big experiment that 's testing to see if a government of the people 
 by the people and for the people can long survive in a world that is not helpful on 
 many occasions 
 You 're going to be expected to carry on that legacy There 's many many ways to 
 do so and I would just say that I want to share some expectations with you in 
 human terms the kind of things that I often share with the officers the young 
 officers and the young troops who hold the line today in our military 
 Our nation is emerging from a period of strategic atrophy I would call it a 
 strategy free time I was shocked when I came in I said bring me the strategy 
 this was on my first day I came in at noon because it was a Saturday we 'd 
 partied late Friday night I came and said Bring me the strategy You know I am 
 ready to sit down and read this They shuffled their feet and said we do n't have 
 one 
 That was my first indication that we might have a little problem there And it 's not 
 a political statement This went back over 10 years we lacked a strategy 
 I bring this up because today we all recognize that terrorism is a clear and present 
 danger and our young guys who are overseas tonight it 's already dark over 
 there and they 're going out one more time boarding the helicopters going on the 
 patrols helping young Afghan boys find their manhood and take the enemy on 
 It 's going on in Syria it 's going on in Iraq and a couple of other places we do n't 
 talk a lot about And I think that while it remains a significant threat today great 
 power competition is the one way we could probably have our way of life changed 
 from freedom to something else 
 So while we 've written up a National Defense Strategy and we 've answered the 
 challenges as we 've defined them the problems we 've defined and we 've 
 defined the problems pretty well with three lines of efforts 
 The first one is we 're going to make the military more lethal Any time a military 
 loses sight of its purpose in this world it ends up getting beaten That 's the 
 bottom line And I want people to just love to talk to our State Department and I 
 want them to dislike the idea of confronting our military on the battlefield because 
 they 've chosen to pick a fight with us 
 So a very lethal military with very high levels of readiness is the first line of effort 
 we 're putting together to keep our experiment alive 
 The second line of effort is one where I spend probably most of my time as 
 General P. said where I 'm on the world stage a lot And that is we 're going to 
 strengthen our existing alliances you know them as NATO or Japan the bilateral 
 treaties that sort of thing We 're going to strengthen those and we 're going to 
 broaden them We 're going to make more partners and more alliances around the 
 world so that we do n't carry the full burden for this 
 This is no longer post World War II with Europe bombed flat and Japan in tatters 
 These are rich nations now in no small part due to what General Marshall did when 
 he left this school having sustained an injury as a Rat and then come out as a 
 natural leader and bred for leadership 
 And he put together much of the effort so I 'm going back to the future in order to 
 bring his ideas forward from the Marshall Plan from NATO and many other places 
 where his thumbprint was so well embedded on everything our nation was doing 
 in terms of foreign policy And it 's very simple why he did this I think because 
 anyone who reads history knows that nations with allies thrive and nations 
 without allies basically wither away 
 So we 're going to create more allies and then the third thing we 're going to do is 
 we 're going to modernize the Department of Defense so every dollar I get I can 
 look the American Congress in the eye and say We did n't waste your money We 
 did n't waste the Treasury and it went to make our military more lethal 
 So that 's a responsibility we carry and I would just tell you ladies and gentlemen 
 that we all know our country 's having a tough time right now in a number of 
 areas I stand here in your beautiful town your beautiful school with mixed 
 emotions I 'm so happy to be out of Washington D.C. right now I could cry 
 Okay We have problems in the country right now But I want you to know 
 probably not well reported just last week the Senate voted 93 to 7 to give us a 
 record breaking budget a second year in a row Why do I bring that up I think the 
 House of Representatives will probably vote overwhelmingly as well this week 
 knock on wood I think they 're going to do that to give us the same budget 
 And I bring this up because there 's going to be times you 're going to watch the 
 news I do n't do it myself if I want to be depressed I go to war you know what 
 I mean As I do n't need to to watch the news But if you watch the news you 
 can start wondering what 's going on in this country You just keep the faith my 
 fine young cadets We 're going to pull through this We 've been through worse 
 than this 
 We 're going to modernize that DOD so as we put the money into the defense 
 budget we can keep the faith and the trust of the American people on which 
 everything else in the Department of Defense depends 
 VMI 's got a key part I think in driving progress along the lines of effort like this 
 because we need sharp young people going into the professions in America and 
 certainly into the military as well And so I want to start with the first two lines of 
 effort and talk a little more detail here and let me start with number two where 
 we 're going to actually build our partnerships and build our alliances even more 
 When you look at George C. Marshall that 1901 graduate of VMI that bronze 
 figure out there in front of your barracks serves as a daily reminder of the positive 
 impacts of his courageous leadership But he was not a man who did things 
 without studying the issues 
 I would just point out too that he proved his qualities that he developed here at 
 VMI and put his education to practice during World War II 's darkest hours 
 certainly when every inch of his body was committed day in and day out seven 
 days a week to making certain we did not lose this experiment to the surging 
 fascists 
 And remember there was nothing certain that we were going to win that war It 
 took the blood sweat and tears of a lot of hundreds of thousands of people many 
 of whom did not ever return from that war 
 But what he did after the war is probably just as compelling where he extended a 
 hand to our allies who 'd been flattened in the war You know how London was 
 bombed and Paris was 
 But he also went to our adversaries Think of how vicious that war was against the 
 Nazis think what it was like in the Pacific Campaign where it was a take no 
 prisoners often kind of fighting and he turns around and he helps set up the plan 
 that draws these nations back together into the community of nations knowing 
 that the future for the younger generation was dependent on us trying to create a 
 better world 
 And that spirit of partnership lives on I 'm sure it lives on here where you 've got 
 foreign cadets here in your ranks and and foreign students here But he also 
 saw that he had the opportunity to build up other kind of alliances He was a key 
 person in NATO in putting NATO together and I had the Australian Ambassador 
 from Washington D.C. sometimes it takes a foreigner talking to us My fine 
 cadets to really understand why we should cherish our citizenship and the 
 Australian ambassador told me over lunch one day in his backyard in Washington 
 he said that America committed the most self sacrificial act in world history after 
 World War II I consider myself somewhat of a knowledgeable historian I 'm 
 scratching my head thinking well the Marshall plan was pretty nice 
 And then he said no no He said it was NATO when America committed 100 
 million dead Americans in a thermal nuclear war for the protection of democracy 
 in Western Europe It took a foreigner to tell me what we 'd done See what I 'm 
 driving at here Think of the level of commitment and devotion to the idea that we 
 take for granted here today of our democracy that as raucous as it may be we all 
 know we have a vote that that a secretary of Defense has no more vote than a 
 cadet once you decide to vote which I hope is young 
 I would just point out to you ladies and gentlemen that what General Marshall 
 saw and treasured so much is going to continue to demand what you do but also 
 with foreign nations It 's going to continue to demand this because we 're still 
 building a nation here we 're still building a nation It 's hard work Its noble work 
 but I 'll say again it 's hard work So do n't ever think we 're done We are not 
 perfect but we are certainly going to always strive to be better 
 And I think that if you look at how we look at the world and if you look at it and 
 say we 're stronger when we 're together we 're going to need you and your vigor 
 we 're going to need your kind of open mindedness as we try to seize opportunities 
 to cooperate across borders And it 's very obvious here when you have cadets 
 from various places Bulgaria Italy China Taiwan Thailand I understand the 
 Republic of Korea Indonesia France Germany 
 Please understand that when you 're in a position General P. and I were in our final 
 tours on active duty having officers who are not willing to listen to other people 
 but are willing to be   there 's a whale of a lot of 
 difference there that means you 're going to come up with the best possible 
 ideas you 're going to come up with the best possible teamwork 
 Not all the good ideas come from a nation with the most aircraft carriers so we 're 
 going to be assuming that you can carry on that legacy And remember America 
 wants no empire of the world other than an empire of ideas The ideas that we 
 stand for are rule of law the dignity of all the teamwork the respect for one 
 another and that sort of thing 
 I think for those of you going in the military it 's good to remember that for 
 whatever challenges we may face today in our nation where was the first time 
 that a man and a woman a black man a white man a Native American all voted 
 as equals in the history of United States And you should be very proud of it 
 because it was on a U.S. Army long range reconnaissance patrol that you and I call 
 the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the mouth of the Columbia River 
 In other words America was never perfect and we 'll never accept its perfect 
 today But the military has often been the model and VMI is certainly in the 
 military tradition in every sense of the word it is the model the rest of our 
 country can turn to a difficult time and say I see how this can look if we all pull 
 together for a common cause 
 I think too that as we look at all of you stand ready to serve I would just point 
 out here that those of you who are ready to look past the hot political rhetoric 
 those of you who are willing to sign that blank check payable to the American 
 people payable with your lives I would just point out that you also with that 
 commitment carry on a tradition that is worth its weight in gold to our allies who 
 look to us for strength and certainly to our adversary to say well maybe I do n't 
 want to try it today 
 Maybe we can keep the peace one more year my fine young cadets one more 
 month one more week one more day while the diplomats work their magic to try 
 and solve the problems that we have out there in the world and there are many as 
 you know right now I think too you need to know those of you who are going on 
 active duty that we do expect you at the top of your game top of your physical 
 game top of your intellectual game and top of your spiritual game So spiritually 
 you have a shock absorber in you that will help carry the shocks of combat when 
 your young troops underneath you face that for the first time 
 We need your curiosity We need you physically tougher than your troops or at 
 least as tough as the very toughest ones you have because that 's the way you 
 gain the respect in the unfair world of those who close with our nation 's enemies 
 And I think when you report to duty we are counting on you to display the 
 audacity in carrying out your commander 's intent that a school like this can create 
 in you because you were brought up with the very legacy of audacity every day 
 when you are walking these hallowed grounds and they are hallowed 
 When you look at the number of young men young women who 've come out of 
 here and gone on to serve We are also looking at you to maintain that long 
 fighting tradition because it 's going to be your attention to duty your example of 
 self discipline your coaching ability and your force of personality that 's going to 
 animate and draw your young troops to look to you when the chips are down 
 You are going to be tested Those of you going into the military you are going to 
 be tested in ways that others of your generation will never know and you will 
 come to know someday and to understand what a privilege it is to be given such 
 tests The general and I would say that we were privileged to fight for this 
 country the many times that we went and did so And you 're going to learn things 
 about your own moral self you 're going to learn things about your ethical self and 
 your fellow men and women in uniform that you 're going to treasure forever 
 That is something that nothing can take it away from you it 's why so many go in 
 for just four or five years and they come out go to grad school or they go off and 
 lead universities or teach or they go off in the corporate world 
 But for those of you will have seen the moonrise on the far side of the world 
 you 're going to get some very privileged glimpses into the human heart as one 
 noted author put it And for you young officers too I want you to remember you 
 only have to win one battle but it 's one you have to win every day And that one 
 battle is for the hearts and minds and the trust and affections of the young men 
 and women who are going to be serving alongside you that you outrank but 
 you 're very very close to 
 You must make sure that as you because you 're going to be given a lot of 
 authority when you 're very young do n't let your passion for excellence outweigh 
 your compassion for them as human beings as young citizens who signed up to go 
 all the way against the enemy If you win their trust you win their respect and 
 they 'll never let you down even in that daunting test of combat So you win that 
 one battle for your troops and then they win all the rest for you 
 I think I 've seen what other units in times have performed so well at I 've had the 
 opportunity like General Peay to observe young officers in many different climbs 
 and places 
 And it was always striking to me how one platoon of 40 young sailors or Marines 
 under a Marine lieutenant could perform at times as well as a company of 160 
 180 
 And I used to just you know almost be in awe of it as I watched them move 
 against the enemy taking casualties keeping moving 
 And eventually I think I found what separated them They were n't different 
 people they were all recruited from America They were all given the same 
 training They had the same kit hanging on them They knew how to call air 
 support They trusted their officers 
 But what made one so fluid and so smooth against the enemy And I would just 
 tell you that it happened in my own unit As a two star I had 29 sailors and 
 Marines around me And in four months 29 of them excuse me 17 of the 29 
 would be killed or wounded It was a very difficult area that we were in 
 And I was amazed eventually I got every officer aide I had shot so eventually I 
 had a gunnery sergeant for my aide because the officers did n't want to be my aide 
 any more you know 
 And I used to be amazed at how he 'd get out with those troops and they 'd be 
 ready to go harder than petrified woodpecker lips you know what I mean One of 
 those kind of guys 
 But he was very very smart He was a communicator and he would always put 
 them through their rehearsals and everything I mean I keep wondering Why do 
 they keep going out with us when we keep getting hit like this 
 And eventually I think the world I settled on was affection There was an 
 affection for one another that he bred in those young sailors and Marines It was 
 an affection that went beyond just the respect 
 And it was not popularity It was not all the favoritism that comes with trying to 
 be popular It was an affection for each other that made them all buy into the 
 mission 
 And I share that with you because there are times when you 're going to be out 
 there and the only person they can look to is going to be you And they 've got to 
 know the toughest guy on the team is their coach and he 's tough for them He 's 
 not tough against them 
 And I bring this up because your understanding of the difference between a 
 mistake and a lack of discipline will be critical You can not expect people to never 
 make mistakes least of all in something that searches you every day on a 
 battlefield full of fear and that sort of thing People make mistakes 
 But if you train people well if you coach them well and you can bring them up 
 then you will spot the one who has not maintained the discipline standards 
 And then you have to do what you have to do to reimpose the discipline And 
 that 's usually a whole lot of real strong coaching Once in a while it 's got to be 
 more than that because you are the senior person there when you get out there 
 And you come out of something like VMI they did not have the chance for four 
 years of growth at an institution and the great opportunity that you have here 
 I want to leave enough time for the Q&A here so I want to just close with 
 something that I learned out overseas You get old like me and you like learning 
 stuff You know It 's like it 's not a pain in the neck like it is in some of the 
 classrooms you know You really want to learn stuff 
 And I was out in the middle of nowhere a few years ago again with my little team 
 there rolling down the road And it was probably oh somewhere around 40 to 50 
 kilometers from the nearest next outpost 
 And we pulled in during the night because we had trouble getting there Got inside 
 this lieutenant 's perimeter with about 40 guys out there sailors and Marines 
 And when the sun came up they came over to see me check in And he said By 
 the way General last night we caught a guy trying to lay an IED on the road you 
 were driving in on 
 I said Well that 's kind of nice You know A little personal you know what I 
 mean Wanted to blow me up 
 He said Yeah he 's an engineer and he speaks perfect English do you want to 
 talk with him I said Sure bring him over 
 So they brought him over to see me And he was shaking like a leaf it was not his 
 best night you know what I mean 
 He 'd been out there with his wheelbarrow he had his two artillery rounds had his 
 car battery he 's got his shovel he 's digging a hole and he looks up and there 's 
 five people with automatic weapons dressed in camouflage 
 And he realized immediately his retirement plan was in jeopardy at that point 
 And so he 's shaking badly He wants a cigarette I decided not to give him my 
 anti smoking lecture for a change He looked like he needed it 
 So I had to light it for him We cut his handcuffs off little plastic cuffs the Marines 
 put on him 
 And I said What are you doing this for You know What 's wrong with you 
 You know You 're a Sunni We 're the Marines we 're the only friends you 've got 
 out here 
 And he started you know going on Well you Jews you Americans you want to 
 steal our oil and all this stuff And I said Okay I said You 're obviously an 
 educated man I 'm not going to waste my time listening to this drivel 
 And he sat there for a minute The Marine guard moved into to take him away And 
 he sat there he 's just sitting there on the ground with me 
 And he said Can I sit here a minute I said Sure And after a minute he 
 seemed to be a little calmer We got him a cup of coffee He 's spilling it he 's still 
 nervous 
 And I said you know What 's up Where ’s your family at you know They lived 
 about 10 kilometers away He had a wife two daughters 
 And we 're talking for a little bit And he said You know just I ca n't stand having 
 foreign soldiers here I respect that I would n't want foreign soldiers in this town 
 you know what I mean I mean that that 's where you can connect with 
 somebody 
 And I said Well I understand but you know you should n't have done that He 
 said I guess I 'm going to jail I said Oh yeah You 're going to be wearing an 
 orange jumpsuit in Abu Ghraib for a good many years for this little stunt 
 And you 're lucky you 're not dead for you know And he said Yeah He says 
 but now I want you all especially you young people to listen to me here 
 He said General do you think if I 'm a model prisoner you know what 's 
 coming do n't you could I someday immigrate to America 
 Think about that Think about that that the hatred he felt was so much that he 
 would go out and try to put a bomb in the road to kill us but the example of 
 America was so strong that if he could be sitting where you are today or have his 
 son and daughter in that audience he 'd have given his eyes or teeth It was n't 
 just because we 'd caught him right then This was deeper 
 And I was reminded America 's got two fundamental powers There 's the power of 
 intimidation and the military the U.S. military exists to warn people You take 
 on America and free men and women are going to fight like the dickens Power 
 of intimidation 
 But there 's also the power of inspiration And the power of inspiration could reach 
 halfway around the world to the Euphrates River Valley and affect someone no 
 matter how blinded they were at that 
 I want you all to remember that because when you 're out there you 're also going 
 to be a part of the power of inspiration And you surrender that high ground that 
 ethical high ground that moral high ground the historic legacy that we carry with 
 us at our nation 's peril 
 So you hold that close You take care of each other And thanks very much for 
 having me here today 
 We 're going to now go to Q&A okay 
 And in Q&A it gets really weird really fast if I 'm looking at you and you 're looking 
 at me and no one 's saying anything okay So let 's find out who 's got the initiative 
 and aggressiveness the two qualities we look for for petty officers and NCOs 
 in the Naval service 
 Who 's got the initiative and aggressiveness to ask the first question 
 Right up here Go ahead 
 Question Good afternoon sir inaudible 
 First of all I 'd just like to say pardon my language but there are a lot of badass 
 women here Some physically fitter than I am and smarter than I am 
 But I remember I was doing some research on the Marine Corps experiment to 
 see if female in combat arms makes us more combat effective And I would just 
 like to hear your thoughts on that 
 SecDef Mattis Yeah It ’s a very very tough issue because it goes from some 
 people 's perspective of what kind of society do we want you know 
 In the event of trouble you 're sleeping at night in your family home and you 're 
 the dad mom whatever And you hear glass break downstairs who grabs a 
 baseball bat and gets between the kids door and whoever broke in and who 
 reaches for the phone to call 9 1 1 
 In other words it goes to the most almost primitive needs of a society to look out 
 for its most vulnerable 
 This is an issue right now that we have Army Navy Marine all looking at as we 
 speak and that is the close quarters fight being what it is You know is it a 
 strength or a weakness to have women in that circumstance 
 Right now what my job is is to make certain that as the chief of staff of the Army 
 or commandant of the Marine Corps or chief of Naval Operations bring problems 
 to me chief of staff of the Air Force and I help them solve them 
 Today because so few women have signed up along these lines we do n't even 
 have data at this time that I can answer your question okay 
 You make a very valid question I might add because I was never under any 
 illusions at what level of respect my marines would have for me if I could n't run 
 with the fastest of them and and look like it did n't bother me If I could n't do as 
 many pull ups as the strongest of them 
 It would just it was the unfairness of the infantry How did the infantry get its 
 name Infant soldier Young soldier Very young soldier They 're cocky they 're 
 rambunctious they 're necessarily macho and it 's the most primitive I would say 
 even evil environment You ca n't even explain it 
 Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. a Civil War veteran as you know who became one of 
 our most noted articulate Supreme Court associate justices talking to veterans 
 themselves decades after the war he looked at them 
 And here 's the most articulate justice you could come up with And he says We 
 have shared the incommunicable experience of war And he meant close combat 
 This is an area we 're going to have to resolve as a nation And the military has got 
 to have officers who look at this with a great deal of objectivity and at the same 
 time remember our natural inclination to have this open to all 
 But we can not do something that militarily does n't make sense and I 've got this 
 being looked at right   of staff of the Army commandant of the 
 Marine Corps and all 
 This is a policy that I inherited and so far the cadre is so small we have no data on 
 it We 're hoping to get data soon There are a few stalwart young ladies who are 
 charging into this but they are too few Right now it 's not even dozens it 's that 
 few So when we get a little more data I 'll give you a much more objective answer 
 Clearly the jury is out on it but what we 're trying to do is give it every opportunity 
 to succeed if it can 
 The other nations that have had this for 20 years still have too few women in the 
 infantry ranks to even draw a conclusion So I ca n't give you a good answer right 
 now I 'm open to it and I 'll be working with the Chief of Staff of the Army and the 
 others to sort it out 
 Question Thank you sir 
 SecDef Mattis You 're welcome and thanks for having the guts to ask the question 
 There 's a lot of places that would n' What else You 're not getting off 
 that light folks 
 Question Hello sir thank you for coming Cadet Barrett class of 2020 I was just 
 wondering hypothetically if you could have every American read one book what 
 would it be 
 SecDef Mattis I tell you these are not easy questions Wow one book Just as an 
 aside I was amazed at how many people talk about strategy or have strategy on 
 their door plates in Washington DC and I 've never read one book about strategy 
 by the way And so I was going to respond in a narrow way and then I 
 remembered I 'm even more fearful of those who 've only read one strategy book 
 and now have all the answers But I think if there was one book that I would read 
 it would be Marcus Aurelius Meditations 
 Especially in Washington DC with all the political heave and ho that I try to keep 
 the Department of Defense out of there can be a sense at times my fine young 
 cadet that it 's the first time anyone 's dealt with something like X Y or Z. And 
 certainly in combat the reason I kept a tattered copy in my rucksack to pull out at 
 times was it allowed me to look at things with a little distance 
 And so Marcus Aurelius had a very tough life He 's the Emperor of Rome but he 's 
 got everything going wrong in his home life His wife and his son were not people 
 that you 'd want to spend much time with He spends almost all of his time up on 
 the fringes of the Empire trying to protect the thing and the one time he leaves the 
 German forest seems to be to go kill one of his friends who 's revolted against him 
 in another place It was a tough life and yet the humility and the dignity with 
 which he conducted his life the commitment to his country to his troops really 
 comes through as you read those pages 
 And while the name of the book is Meditations if you were to get the real 
 translation of it it would be to himself He 's writing these chapters to himself 
 because he knows he faces nothing new under the sun 
 So I think I 'd go with that one If I wanted to know about a person who had to 
 deal with big issues and how he did it in his own words I do n't think you could do 
 better than to read Ulysses Grant 's autobiography I think his memoirs would be 
 the one if you want something that 's perhaps not quite so ancient I really did n't 
 serve with Marcus Aurelius I just look that old okay But that 's a great question 
 You had me there for a minute I was how do I answer that 
 Question Thank you sir 
 SecDef Mattis Thank you 
 Question Good afternoon sir Cadet Joseph Phillips class of 2019 My question is 
 based on your experiences what is the best advice you could give for us who are 
 going to be second lieutenants in the near months 
 SecDef Mattis I 'm going to the Dean to get answers Did you see that 
 You know I think what I would say is make certain that you listen to your NCOs 
 You 're going to go somewhere and your petty officers are out at sea today even if 
 you 're in your rat year your first year here They 're going to be out there this year 
 and next year the year after you're going to come out of your Navy training or 
 you 're going to come out of your army training and the guy has been deployed 
 over in Afghanistan all these years and make certain you listen to those NCOs 
 However they do not expect you to do exactly what they say each time They want 
 you to listen You should question them about why they 're recommending 
 something And as long as there 's not an urgency to the decision but they do 
 expect you to apply your own judgment okay 
 So it 's a balancing act between being open and accepting of all of the input your 
 NCOs can give you but at the same time you 're responsible you chart your own 
 course and you will be held responsible so you ca n't become an automaton to 
 someone else 
 Now I will suggest to you that if a Lance Corporal yells at you to hit the deck you 
 do n't get in a big argument about who outranks who okay So sometimes you just 
 do what the young lads tell you But other times you employ your quantitative and 
 your nonquantitative judgment and make certain you employee your quantitative 
 first 
 If it has to do with miles of walking or gunnery or something employ your 
 judgment There 's a reason we taught you geometry There 's a reason why we 
 taught you history but then apply your informed subjective judgment your 
 professional judgment as well But make sure you listen to them 
 I always laugh about the young NCOs who tell me hey I got promoted thanks I 
 say well you got me out of every bad spot every tough situation I got you into 
 so I owe you that you know Just remember those are the ones are going to take 
 you out so you 've got to listen to them before you get in 
 They 'd prefer you talk to them before you crash land the airplane into the ground 
 rather than waiting until you 're on the ground they can help avoid some of those 
 things I would n't be here if it were n't for listening to NCOs I'll tell you that Who 
 else had a question There 's a lot of them out there 
 Staff Sir we have time for one more question 
 SecDef Mattis Okay well how about if we take more than one more.1 The general 
 The general gave me permission The general gave me permission earlier 
 and remember 
 I do n't have stress I create it so no problem there So let 's play another question 
 or two here 
 Who else has a microphone here 
 Question Good afternoon sir Cadet Hoops My question sir is we live in this 
 technology era where people have very sedentary lifestyle and kids today are 
 coming into the military very out of shape it 's causing a lot of problems Do you 
 believe that 's a problem And how do you think we can go about fixing that 
 SecDef Mattis There 's a little bit of an echo down here as you can tell It 's taken 
 two of us to sort this out You know it ’s a sad state of affairs just talking to an 
 army general here recently It 's a sad state of affairs when 71 percent of the 18 to 
 24 year old males in this country can not qualify to enter the United States Army 
 as a private 
 And that 's kind of a baseline you know That 's a baseline that you 've got to be at 
 least you know not obese not using drugs you know a high school grad and 
 real baseline And the army establishes it through army regs and it is not an 
 exaggerated one 
 The army knows they 've got to be the ones who train and bring the young lads and 
 gals up to standard but they 've got to start with something It is why I think 
 when I tell you tell you the legacy of this school is so important if you go back and 
 look at our history we 've needed very large militaries 
 And today we do n't need as large of military but we need one big enough And 
 when are you drawing from only 29 percent at the beginning only 29 percent is 
 your total recruiting population it creates a real problem for us 
 It reminds us why we need allies frankly and it reminds us even when we get 
 people in the military in an increasingly overweight country an increasingly 
 drug prone country we need some of you who are going to be the Spartans of the 
 gate because we 're not going to hang onto these freedoms because our 
 grandfathers fought on the beaches of Normandy or because our fathers fought in 
 Vietnam 
 Every generation as President Reagan put it is going to have to fight to keep this 
 experiment alive It 's a big concern to me I do n't know what we can do about it 
 There are retired officers and NCOs senior NCOs who are working across the 
 country in the schools to try to restore physical education where it 's been taken 
 out to try to get school lunches to be things that fuel the body instead of just 
 giving them crummy food 
 I do n't have a good solution for it We go to the Congress with the problem that 
 Congress wants to help They have n't figured out how to make their programs 
 contribute to a better society but it 's also where we 're going to have to have 
 leaders And for those of you who are not going into the military do n't wait until 
 you have my color hair to run for the school board and get on the school board in 
 your local community 
 A lot of America most of America 's problems are solved at the local level And 
 that 's going to have to be where this one gets solved And there 's parts of the 
  that are much more physically fit than other parts of the 
 country and our recruiters know it and they hone in on those areas 
 But they 're not going to be enough in the long run if we do n't turn this around 
 And when you look at childhood diabetes you can see the health risk of what 
 we 're doing to the younger generation So take the fitness that you 're expected to 
 maintain here into every walk of life not just your family but your parish your 
 school district your local communities and get out there and start working with 
 the kids when they 're young because once they 've gone over the edge it 's very 
 hard to bring them back 
 Other questions I 'll try and hear the question hold the mic a little further from 
 your go ahead 
 Question First off Mr. Secretary it 's quite an honor to be speaking to you So my 
 first question is actually well I guess it 's kind of a two parter sir I asked this 
 to the vice army chief of staff two years ago at a leadership conference so I want 
 to ask you the same thing 
 There 's a lot of threats that people consider with cyber and other things What is 
 America 's first and second most external threat whether that be physical or just 
 psychological warfare and how do you adapt the DOD whether that be 
 conventional or unconventional warfare 
 SecDef Mattis That 's a good that one is actually relatively go ahead and grab 
 a seat young man 
 That one 's actually a pretty easy one for me and the reason I say that is that this 
 is what we had to deal with when I came in I think when you look at external 
 threats the first one I have to look at is the nuclear threat out of Russia and to a 
 lesser degree China and certainly North Korea but North Korea 's an urgent threat 
 So the nuclear threat is one that does n't get talked about a lot but believe me 
 standing right over here about no more than 100 feet away is a communicator 
 with a backpack with certain communications equipment and codes in it that 
 accompany me everywhere I go 
 And it is a very real threat and we 're going to have to address keep that one as 
 a deterrent because a nuclear war can not be won so it must never be fought And 
 the way we do that in this imperfect world is through a deterrent that basically 
 threatens the worst possible calamity on anyone who would try it 
 The cyber threat is one that is actually linked to the growing threat in space And I 
 wo n't spend time connecting the two but I will tell you that how we protect our 
 country was brought into stark relief on 9/11 when for all of our ships at sea all 
 of our soldiers in uniform everything else we had every one of us who was 
 wearing a uniform and the intelligence agencies knew we had let down America on 
 9/11 
 So as we look at these unconventional threats we can not think because they do n't 
 want to fight our way that we can simply opt out We 're going to have to learn 
 how to protect our country and I think that in the long run what 's going to 
 happen on cyber is because Department of Defense has about 95 percent or more 
 of the capability to protect the country on cyber 
 We 're probably going to have to offer to banks to public utilities electrical 
 generation plants that sort of thing the opportunity to be inside a government 
 protected domain Now it 's not going to be forced and there are constitutional 
 issues but I think we should also offer it to small businesses and individuals 
 It would be completely up to them whether or not they came inside but I think 
 eventually we 're going to have to change the technology and there 's way we can 
 do it I 'm talking to real smart people about what they do on cyber defense so that 
 we 're more resistant and more resilient at the same time 
 And you know that right without going into details we are actively engaged and 
 protecting the election coming up as we speak right now Matter of fact we need 
 to be back in Washington D.C. this afternoon for a discussion on it 
 So I would just tell you that as the threats change we can not be dominant and 
 irrelevant at the same time able to fight ground battles unable to fight in 
 cyberspace or outer space so we 're working on it 
 There 's also other challenges out there as well but in terms of urgency I 'd say 
 North Korea In terms of power right now it is probably Russia and the nuclear 
 threat And in terms of long term political will it 's China 
 But China does not have to be a threat We can find a way to work together with 
 China We 're two nuclear armed superpowers and we 're going to have to learn 
 how to manage our relationship and I do believe we can do that 
 So that 's kind of how I stack the threads up and on cyber we 're going to have to 
 do some real changing of how we guard ourselves I got a great Army four star 
 General Nakasone in command of Cyber Command and he 's at the top of his 
 game respected across the country and around the world and he 's making a lot of 
 changes right now It 's going to take all of us rolling up our sleeves 
 We 'll go with one last question I know you got things to do here 
 Question Good afternoon sir 
 SecDef Mattis Go ahead 
 Question Cadet inaudible class of 2019 
 I wanted to ask you you spoke of a more lethal military force Given the global 
 push toward demilitarization as well as America 's traditional role as the quote 
 unquote police force of the world how do you see balancing those few things 
 SecDef Mattis I think right now let me just take NATO for example because I 
 mentioned that when I first spoke Right now in NATO every country has 
 increased the amount of money it 's putting into defense Is it as much as we think 
 is necessary No 
 Now let me give you some background The democracies are always slower to 
 rearm and you saw that during the inner war year between World War I and 
 World War II when they wanted to think after World War I there ca n't be any 
 more of this And of course there were fascists who saw it differently 
 So what happens is democracies are slower but when they move it 's much more 
 powerful because they have the will of their people behind it I was first at NATO 
 in 1996 when I was the Executive Secretary to the Secretary of Defense William 
 Perry in the Clinton Administration and then Bill Cohen Senator Cohen and I 
 heard both of them in presentations in Brussels say you have got to spend more 
 money of defense because you 're counting on us Americans to do it all and that 's 
 not the way an alliance works 
 I then heard that same theme from a man from Rumsfeld and a secretary named 
 Gates Secretary Rumsfeld Secretary Gates and from President Bush when he 
 was president And then President Obama came in and I heard him say it talk 
 about it 's time to start doing nation building at home going to Europe saying 
 we 're not going to keep doing this 
 And I was a NATO Supreme Commander in those days They were slow to do it 
 Slow very slow Even after the terrorist attacks they wanted to handle it as law 
 enforcement problems So there 's different ways Each country has its own culture 
 and we have to respect that 
 But when I went there now as Secretary of Defense and I 'm looking around that 
 same table I once sat behind as a colonel and then I sat as the table Only three 
 officers do The rest are civilian representing the 28 nations now 29 and I told 
 them you know I 've sat at this very table 
 Many of them were friends You know you get to know each other And I said 
 and you heard this for over two decades You heard this message that you have 
 to pay more I said now it is manifested politically in America and I 'm bringing 
 you a message and the message is very clear 
 And that message is you can not expect me to go home and look Americans in the 
 eye and say we want our parents to care more about European children 's freedom 
 than European parents care You 're going to have to start carrying more of your 
 load 
 And since then the Secretary General of NATO said because of America 's 
 leadership there now are 29 nations in NATO all increasing their military 
 spending Now that is from the Secretary General the former Prime Minister of 
 Norway Not an American That 's a European 
 And I bring this up because there are times if you look through history World 
 War I militarism is on the march You know Belgium falls and the Netherlands 
 fall I mean everyone is falling France is fighting and being bled dry The British 
 army is being driven to its knees And the Americans sit on their side of the ocean 
 and say it 's not our problem You democracies handle it on your own 
 Finally we go into the war in the last year and a half of the war and we come in 
 fresh Okay World War II France falls Norway falls Greece Falls I can go on 
 Netherlands Denmark London is getting   the Americans 
 said it 's not our problem We 're not going to get involved in another European 
 war We 're tired of going in there and doing this with you 
 We are a very isolationist  the reason I bring it up is today 
 the first time NATO went to war when we joined NATO in order to protect Western 
 Europe was when New York City and Washington D.C. were attacked That 's the 
 first time they went to war 
 So remember that alliances wax and wane but no relationship stays the same 
 They get stronger or weaker And if you and your families and your communities 
 and your schools you too know the same thing 
 So work to make the relationships stronger I will tell you that right now all of 
 NATO woke up after 2014 and Russia moved into Ukraine and took Crimea And all 
 of NATO is wide awake now I 'm on my way there next week again And it is very 
 clear that our capability is building up across all the western democracies 
 Prime Minister Abe in Japan is rearming there in a way that Japan was never 
 willing to do because of what happened prior to World War II Certainly Australia 
 I can go on So sometimes America has to  we have n't been 
 perfect in anticipating things either 
 So let 's keep patience Keep working with one another Keep respect for one 
 another But at the same time be   as we go forward 
 And democracies are now rearming 
 My fine young cadets I 've got to get out of here But I just wanted to tell you that 
 I do n't get to see people like you very often and I do n't know you individually But 
 every one of you could 've picked an easier school to go to Every one of you 
 could 've gone to a place that was n't going to demand as much of you as this one 
 So just remember if you want three words that I would leave you with that will 
 keep you from laying on a shrink 's couch when you 're 45 wondering what the hell 
 did I do with my life 
 Just remember three words here put others first And if you 're always putting 
 your wife or your husband your children your parents your parish your school 
 district your community your infantry platoon your fighter squadron whatever it 
 is If you 're always putting others first you 're going to be in for the most 
 wonderfully satisfying life you could imagine 
 And you do n't have to learn some things that most people could learn by reading 
 an old book that going out for yourself alone is just not the way to go if you 
 want to have a truly happy and satisfying life So God bless you all Thanks for 
 spending some time and having me here today It 's been a pleasure for me",0.0183413121849298,0.0176022872328758,0.0038152309134602,0.2179155498743057,0.7232179641723633,0.0049505122005939,0.0141571881249547,0.1144035031461932,0.4651303483174826,70.78350254282435,0.1680475504322766,0.010997377548430758,0.06996466431095406,0.018595825426944972,22.86460348162476,0.0
96,Prime Minister Stephen Harper,A Government Selected by Canadians,2008," Once again good evening 
 Less than two months ago the people of Canada gave our Party a strengthened 
 mandate to lead Canada during the most serious global economic crisis in 
 generations Since that time we 've acted acted on our commitment to keep 
 cutting job killing taxes business taxes acted to expedite the constructions of 
 roads bridges and other infrastructure acted to strengthen Canada 's already 
 strong financial   of billions of dollars of liquidity into 
 Canada 's credit markets acted to ensure a long term structural balance in the 
 federal budget and acted to demonstrate   reduce 
 taxpayer subsidies for political parties 
 Our actions have been proactive They have been responsible And they have been 
 in keeping with our commitments to Canadians More so these actions represent 
 our first steps In the next couple of months the government will present a 
 budget that outlines our next move forward a plan that will include expected 
 stimulus measures worked out in consultation with Canada ’s provinces and in 
 concert with the other members of the G20 
 While we have been working on the economy the opposition has been working on 
 a backroom deal to overturn the results of the last election without seeking the 
 consent of voters They want to take power not earn it They want to install a 
 government   that received its lowest vote share since confederation 
 They want to install a prime minister Prime Minister Dion who was rejected by 
 the voters just six weeks ago They want to install a coalition that they explicitly 
 promised not to support 
 The liberals campaigned against a coalition with the NDP precisely because they 
 said the NDP ’s policies were bad for the economy And now they plan to enter into 
 the very same coalition under the guise of strengthening the economy Stéphane 
 Dion and the NDP plan to make this   support of a Party 
 that wants to destroy the country The opposition has every right to defeat the 
 government But Stéphane Dion does not have the right to take power without an 
 election 
 Canada ’s government should be  backroom deals 
 It should be your choice not theirs 
 And it ’s now up to all of us to stand up for the right of Canadians to choose their 
 own government On December the 8th the House of Commons will have an 
 opportunity to vote on the opposition ’s attempt to overturn the results of the last 
 election Until then we will continue governing In the meantime Canadians can 
 make their views known on this issue to all their Members of Parliament 
 Thank you very much and I hope you will all have a good weekend",0.0574942231178283,0.0109570454806089,0.0468524657189846,0.0527840219438076,0.8109042048454285,0.0154970036819577,0.0055110515095293,0.1073934837092731,0.4030075187969924,50.7922961956522,0.3701298701298701,0.0223463687150838,0.1134453781512605,0.15432098765432098,21.48,0.0
97,Michelle Obama,Democratic National Convention Keynote Address,2008," As As you might imagine for for Barack running for President is nothing 
 compared to that first game of basketball with my brother Craig 
 I I ca n't tell you how much it means to have Craig and my mom here tonight 
 Like Like Craig I can feel my dad looking down on us just as I 've felt his 
 presence in every grace filled moment of my life 
 And at six foot six I 've often felt like Craig was looking down on me too 
 literally But the truth is both when we were kids and today Craig was n't looking 
 down on me he was watching over me And he has been there for me every step 
 of the way since that clear day February 19 months ago when with little more 
 than our faith in each other and a hunger for change we joined my husband 
 Barack Obama on the improbable journey that has led us to this moment 
 But each of us comes here   our own improbable journey I come 
 here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector 
 and my lifelong friend And I come here as a wife who loves my husband and 
 believes he will be an extraordinary President 
 And I come here as a mom as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and 
 the center of my world They 're the first things I think about when I wake up in 
 the morning and the last thing I think about before I go to bed at night Their 
 future and all our children 's future is my stake in this election 
 And I come here as a daughter raised on the South Side of 
 who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my 
 brother and me My mother 's love has always been a sustaining force for our 
 family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion her 
 intelligence reflected in my daughters 
 My dad was our rock 
 And although he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early 30s he was our 
 provider He was our champion our hero But as he got sicker it got harder for 
 him to walk took him longer to get dressed in the morning you know But if he 
 was in pain he never let on He never stopped smiling and laughing even while 
 struggling to button his shirt even while using two canes to get himself across the 
 room to give my mom a kiss He just woke up a little earlier and he worked a little 
 harder 
 He and my mom poured everything they had into me and Craig It was the 
 greatest gift a child could receive never doubting for a single minute that you 're 
 loved and cherished and have a place in this world And thanks to their faith and 
 their hard work we both were able to go to college So I know firsthand from 
 their lives and mine that the American Dream endures 
 And you know what struck me when I first met Barack was that even though he 
 had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the 
 continent in Hawaii his family was so much like mine He was raised by 
 grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents 
 mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did And like my family they 
 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had for 
 themselves 
 And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard 
 for what you want in life that your word is your bond that you do what you say 
 you 're going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you 
 do n't know them and even if you do n't agree with them 
 And Barack and I set out to build lives   and to pass them on 
 to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this 
 nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach 
 of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them 
 And as our friendship grew and I learned more about Barack he introduced me to 
 work the work that he 'd done when he first moved to Chicago after college You 
 see instead of heading to Wall Street Barack went to work in neighborhoods that 
 had been   Jobs dried up And Barack was 
 invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods about how to rebuild 
 their community 
 And the people gathered there together that day were ordinary folks doing the 
 best they could to build a good life See they were parents trying to get by from 
 paycheck to paycheck grandparents trying to get it together on a fixed income 
 men frustrated that they could n't support their families after jobs had 
 disappeared You see those folks were n't asking for a handout or a shortcut See 
 they were ready to work They wanted to contribute They believed like you and I 
 believe that America should be a place where you can make it if you try 
 And Barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever 
 since He talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be And he said 
 that all too often we accept the distance between the two and we settle for the 
 world as it is even when it does n't reflect our values and aspirations 
 But he reminded us that we also know what the world should like look like He 
 said we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us 
 to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world 
 as it should be And is n't that the great American story 
 It 's the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in high 
 school gyms and people who stood up and marched and risked everything they 
 had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals 
 And it 's because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two 
 anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 
 45th anniversary and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when Dr. 
 King lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation 
 And I stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece 
 of the American dream is a blessing hard- came before me all of 
 them   conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early 
 each day to painstakingly dress himself for work the same conviction that drives 
 the men and women I 've met all across this country 
 People who work the day shift then kiss their kids good night and head out for the 
 night shift without disappointment without regret See that good night kiss is a 
 reminder of everything they 're working for 
 The military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table 
 The servicemen The servicemen and   women who love this country so much 
 they leave those they love most to defend it 
 The young people across America serving our communities teaching children 
 cleaning up neighborhoods caring for the least among us each and every day 
 People like Hillary Clinton who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling 
 so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little 
 higher 
 People like Joe Biden who has never forgotten where he came from and never 
 stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need 
 someone on their side again 
 All of us   belief that the world as it is just wo n't do that we 
 have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be 
 And that is the thread that connects our hearts That is the thread that runs 
 through my journey and Barack 's journey and so many other improbable journeys 
 that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new 
 tide of hope And you see that is why I love this country 
 And in my own life in my own life in my own small way I have tried to give 
 back to this country that has given me so much See that 's why I left a job at a big 
 law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to 
 volunteer in their communities because I believe that each of us no matter 
 what our age or background or our walk in life each of us has something to 
 contribute to the life of this nation 
 And it 's a belief Barack shares a belief at the heart of his life 's work See it 's what 
 he did all those years ago in Chicago setting up job training to get people back to 
 work and after school programs to keep kids safe working   help 
 people lift up their families It 's what he did in the Illinois Senate moving people 
 from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for hardworking families and making sure 
 women get equal pay for equal work It 's what he 's done in the United States 
 Senate fighting to ensure that the men and women who serve this country are 
 welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and 
 benefits and health care including mental health care 
 See that 's why Barack 's running to end the war in Iraq responsibly to build an 
 economy that lifts every family to make sure health care is available for every 
 American and to make sure that every single child in this nation has a world class 
 education all the way from preschool to college That 's what Barack will Obama 
 will do as President of the United States of America 
 He 'll achieve these goals the same way he always  together and 
 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are You see Barack 
 does n't care where you 're from or what your background is or what party if any 
 you belong to See that 's just not how he sees the world He knows that thread 
 that connects us our belief in America 's promise our commitment to our 
 children 's future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together 
 as one nation even when we disagree 
 It was strong enough to bring hope to those neighborhoods in Chicago It was 
 strong enough to bring hope to the mother he met who was worried about her 
 child in Iraq hope to the man who 's unemployed and ca n't afford gas to find a job 
 hope to the student working nights to pay for her sister 's health care sleeping 
 just a few hours a day 
 And it was strong enough to bring hope to people who came out on a cold Iowa 
 night and became the first voices in this chorus for change that has been echoed 
 by millions of Americans from every corner of this nation millions of Americans 
 who know that Barack understands their dreams millions of Americans who know 
 that Barack will fight for people like them and that Barack will bring finally the 
 change that we need 
 And in the end And in the end after all that 's happened these past 19 months 
 see the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in love with 19 years 
 ago He 's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the 
 hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snail 's pace peering at us 
 anxiously at the through the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her 
 future in his hands determined to give her everything he 'd struggled so hard for 
 himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of 
 a father 's love 
 And as I tuck that little girl in as I tuck that little girl in and her little sister into 
 bed at night you see I I think about how one day they 'll have families of their 
 own and how one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own 
 children about what we did together in this election They 'll tell them They 'll tell 
 them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time 
 how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming how this time 
 in this great country where a girl from the South Side of Chicago can go to 
 college and law school and the son of a single mother from Hawaii can go all the 
 way to the White House that we committed ourselves we committed 
 ourselves to building the world as it should be 
 So tonight in honor of my father 's memory and my daughters future out of 
 gratitude for those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday 
 sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing 
 their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let 's stand together to 
 elect Barack Obama President of the United States of America

98,Zainab Al Suwaij,2004 Republican National Convention Address,2004," Thank you for your kind welcome 
 From my heart I would like to offer you the traditional Muslim greeting 
 Assalaamu alaykum Peace be upon you 
 I am honored to stand here tonight When I came to the United States from Iraq 
 twelve years ago I would never have imagined myself speaking to a group like 
 this Living under Saddam Hussein we could not gather as we do now to discuss 
 things like democracy and freedom We could only dream of a day when we could 
 speak freely and worship God in a ways of our own choosing   Instead we lived 
 under a murderer who used every weapon in his arsenal against us from tanks 
 to torture chambers to poison gas When people talk about the war in Iraq I want 
 to remind them that there has been a war raging in Iraq for the last three decades 
 A war was   I lived through it I saw it 
 brutalized my friends and my family 
 But today I come to tell you that Iraq enjoys a new day 
 Yes there is still a blood chain and uncertainty but America under the strong 
 compassionate leadership of a President Bush has given Iraqis the most precious 
 gift any nation has ever given to another the gift of democracy and the freedom 
 to determine its own future 
 Already the seeds of democracy are bearing fruit with popular elections recently 
 held for local officials and we know our children face a brighter future 
 So as I grieve for the courageous Americans and Iraqis who were killed and 
 injured during Iraq ’s liberation I tell you proudly that their noble sacrifice was not 
 in vein 
 As Iraqis assume full sovereignty they embrace the American people in friendship 
 and gratitude I promise you we will never forget what your sons and daughters 
 did for us

99,Benjamin Franklin,On the Constitution,1787," Mr. President 
 I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present 
 approve but I am not sure I shall never approve them for having lived long I 
 have experienced many instances of being or fuller 
 consideration to change opinions even on important subjects which I once 
 thought right but found to be otherwise It is therefore that the older I grow the 
 more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect to the 
 judgment of others 
 Most men indeed as well as most sects in Religion think themselves in possession 
 of all truth and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error Steele a 
 Protestant in a Dedication tells the Pope that the only difference between our 
 Churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is the Church of 
 Rome is infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong But though 
 many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of 
 their sect few express it so naturally as a certain French lady who in a dispute 
 with her sister said I do n't know how it happens Sister but I meet with no body 
 but myself that 's always in the right Je ne trouve que moi qui aie toujours 
 raison 
 In these sentiments Sir I agree to this Constitution with all its faults if they are 
 such because I think a general Government necessary for us and there is no form 
 of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered and 
 believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years and 
 can only end in Despotism as other forms have done before it when the people 
 shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government being incapable of any 
 other 
 I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain may be able to make a 
 better Constitution For when you assemble a number of men to have the 
 advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble with those men all their 
 prejudices their passions their errors of opinion their local interests and their 
 selfish views From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected It 
 therefore astonishes me Sir to find this system approaching so near to perfection 
 as it does and I think it will astonish our enemies who are waiting with 
 confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the Builders of 
 Babel and that our States are on the point of separation only to meet hereafter 
 for the purpose of cutting one another 's throats 
 Thus I consent Sir to this Constitution because I expect no better and because I 
 am not sure that it is not the best The opinions I have had of its errors I sacrifice 
 to the public good I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad Within these 
 walls they were born and here they shall die If every one of us in returning to our 
 Constituents were to report the objections he has had to it and endeavor to gain 
 partisans in support of them we might prevent its being generally received and 
 thereby lose all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally in 
 our favor among foreign Nations as well as among ourselves from our real or 
 apparent unanimity 
 Much of the strength and efficiency of any Government in procuring and securing 
 happiness to the people depends on opinion on the general opinion of the 
 goodness of the Government as well as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its 
 Governors I hope therefore that for our own sakes as a part of the people and for 
 the sake of posterity we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this 
 Constitution if   
 wherever our influence may extend and turn our future thoughts and endeavors 
 to the means of having it well administered 
 On the whole Sir I can not help expressing a wish that every member of the 
 Convention who may still have objections to it would with me on this occasion 
 doubt a little of his own infallibility and to make manifest our unanimity put his 
 name to this instrument",0.0151800010353326,0.0488245263695716,0.0873933136463165,0.0103869214653968,0.1473208218812942,0.0130822444334626,0.6778121590614319,0.1922590702947845,0.554419879062736,40.05654251012149,0.463768115942029,0.0034802784222737818,0.10443037974683544,0.129366106080207,43.1,0.0
100,Tom Wheeler,National Cable Telecommunications Association Conference Keynote,2014," It ’s great to be here 
 And I also want to say right at the outset indicate that I 'm not here alone that 
 joining us at this gathering are all of the members of the FCC And you 'll be 
 hearing from Commissioner Clyburn Commissioner Rosenworcel Commissioner 
 Pai and Commissioner O'Rielly at other events and I 'm sure that that the 
 thoughts that they have to share with you will be both insightful and helpful 
 because I sure am grateful to be able to work with them 
 You know I had intended to open this session with some light banter about being 
 back here on the stage at NCTA But there 's a serious issue that I want to address 
 right away and that 's the future of the Internet I want to specifically direct 
 these remarks at you the principal providers of broadband connectivity 
 We have circulated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to my fellow commissioners 
 on the topic of the Open Internet There are two things that are important to 
 understand   First this is a Notice which asks a number of questions and seeks 
 input on the best way to protect and promote the Open Internet Second all 
 options are on the table Our goal is to put into place real protections for 
 consumers innovators and entrepreneurs that until now have been only a matter 
 of debate and litigation I believe this process will put us on track to quickly get to 
 legally enforceable Open Internet rules 
 I am interested in results The Commission has been trying to do something for 
 almost a decade starting in fact when Michael Powell was Chairman It ’s time for 
 this job to be finished We have been waiting long enough 
 Because cable has become a principal provider of broadband this is an 
 appropriate forum to discuss our intentions If you read some of the press 
 accounts about what we propose to do those of you who oppose net neutrality 
 might feel like a celebration was in order Reports that we are gutting the Open 
 Internet rules are incorrect I am here to say wait a minute Put away the party 
 hats The Open Internet rules will be tough enforceable and with the concurrence 
 of my colleagues in place with dispatch 
 For all the millions of Americans who access the Internet and to you who provide 
 broadband connectivity it is only fair to spell out some expectations that will 
 inform the proposed Open Internet rules on which we are seeking public 
 comment 
 The D.C. Circuit in the Verizon v. FCC decision upheld the Commission ’s judgment 
 that absent such rules such as those set forth in the Open Internet Order 
 broadband providers represent a threat to Internet openness and could act in 
 ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future broadband 
 deployment 
 I believe that innovation is fragile and that as we said in our 2010 Order 
 broadband providers have incentives to interfere with competing edge providers 
 and as the D.C. Circuit wrote have powerful incentives to accept fees from edge 
 providers either in return for excluding their competitors or for granting them 
 prioritized access to end users 
 Our proposed course of action builds on the court ’s strong legal justification for 
 regulation that guarantees every user the ability to effectively use the Internet 
 We are beyond the question of the scope of the FCC ’s authority the court has 
 decided that Knowing that authority we now must move expeditiously to make it 
 manifest 
 There has been a great deal of talk about how our following the court ’s instruction 
 to use a commercially reasonable test could result in a so called fast lane and 
 Internet haves and have nots This misses the point that any new rule will 
 assure an open pathway that is sufficiently robust to enable   consumers to access 
 the content services and applications they demand and innovators and edge 
 providers the ability to offer new products and services 
 Put another way the focus of this proposal on which we are seeking comment 
 is on maintaining a broadly available fast and robust Internet as a platform for 
 economic growth innovation competition free expression and broadband 
 investment and deployment Our goal is rules that will encourage broadband 
 providers to continually upgrade service to all We will follow the court ’s blueprint 
 for achieving this and I must warn you will look skeptically on special 
 exceptions 
 In the 30 years since I last stood on this stage I have built new technology based 
 companies as an entrepreneur and helped other companies grow as a venture 
 capitalist I know in my bones how hard it is to start a company with innovative 
 ideas Now as Chairman of the FCC I do not intend to allow innovation to be 
  of the most important network of our time the 
 Internet 
 As an entrepreneur and as an investor I understand the importance of supplying 
 businesses with certainty That 's another reason why the sooner we can get 
 enforceable rules in place the better off everyone will be   Internet entrepreneurs 
 and those who support them need the certain knowledge that their ability to get to 
 market will not be   the Internet 
 Let me be clear If someone acts to divide the Internet between haves and 
 have nots we will use every power at our disposal to stop it I consider that to 
 include Title II Just because it is my strong belief that following the court ’s 
 roadmap will produce similar protections more quickly does not mean I will 
 hesitate to use Title II if warranted And in our Notice we are asking for input as 
 to whether this approach should be used 
 Since we are in Los Angeles let me use a highway traffic metaphor Prioritizing 
 some   rest of the traffic into a congested lane wo n’t be 
 permitted under any proposed Open Internet rule We will not allow some 
 companies to force Internet users into a slow lane so that others with special 
 privileges can have superior service 
 Consumers have rightfully come to expect quality access to all points on the 
 Internet Blocking access to lawful content and services would be inconsistent 
 with the transaction that made them your subscribers The bottom line on the 
 proposed Open Internet rules is that the Internet will remain an open pathway If 
 users ca n’t effectively use the pathway then the conduct will be a violation of the 
 Open Internet rules 
 I do not expect this debate to end today and I do n’t want it to We are moving 
 quickly to tee up the issues and invite discussion and debate Let ’s move this 
 process forward 
 Now that I ’ve addressed that topic at the front of everyone ’s mind let me revert 
 to my favorite activity historical reflection   And to a theme that encapsulates 
 my perspective on your industry namely from those to whom much has been 
 given much is to be expected 
 In my professional lifetime the industry has gone from Cable 1.0 to Cable 2.0 
 Cable 1.0 was all about video The industry along with DBS enabled an enormous 
 expansion in the quantity and quality of video content The record provides 
 substantial reason for industry pride although any celebration should be 
  involving both price and service 
 Today ’s Cable 2.0 industry is different in two significant ways 
 First it is now the incumbent not the insurgent 
 Second as we have been discussing it has transformed from video to broadband 
 The move from Cable 1.0 to Cable 2.0 was 
 unimaginable change in cable ’s regulatory circumstance   It has gone from 
 regulatory constraints that were breathtakingly inhibiting to regulatory 
 constraints that are barely discernible 
 In my present line of work I encounter people who believe that the FCC ’s 
 broadband deregulation was equivalent to the discovery of fire and invention of 
 the wheel and others who believe that it was the equivalent of original sin   I do n’t 
 propose to join in that debate today nor to attempt to sort out whether 
 deregulation and levels of cable investment in broadband are causal or 
 coincidental   But I do want to point out that for all of its importance cable today 
 confronts relatively little regulation in its principal business which has become 
 and will continue to be broadband 
 But as we have been discussing with regard to the open Internet that does not 
 put it in a zone free of obligation and oversight I have written and spoken about 
 the Network Compact the essential relationship between those who build and 
 operate networks and their consumers   There are five components to the Network 
 Compact access interconnection consumer protection public safety and national 
 security   Especially in connection with broadband both you and we at the FCC 
 have important responsibilities to the American people with regard to these 
 values 
 It is not too much to say that our nation ’s prosperity security and values are 
 affected in fundamental   networks 
 Our prosperity is a function among other things of the quality of our broadband 
 networks and therefore of the investments you make in their construction 
 operation and maintenance 
 Our security is a function among other things of the reliability of our broadband 
 networks and therefore of the effectiveness of the measures you undertake to 
 protect them 
 Our values are implicated among other  to transmit and 
 receive facts ideas and opinions and therefore of the practices you adopt with 
 respect to the openness of our broadband networks 
 As a result of the importance of our broadband networks our society has the right 
 to demand highly responsible performance from those who operate those 
 networks 
 And the FCC has the responsibility to oversee such performance and to intervene if 
 it falls short   At the FCC our focus is on the availability security and openness of 
 your broadband networks Let me address each for a moment 
 On availability we believe that the private sector must play the leading role in 
 extending broadband networks to every American That ’s why we are committed 
 to removing barriers to investment and to lowering the costs of broadband 
 build out But we also are interested because in Section 706 among other places 
 in the Communications Act Congress has placed broadband deployment and 
 infrastructure investments very high among our priorities 
 We also recognize that there are some areas where it does n’t make financial sense 
 for you to build That ’s why the Commission modernized our Universal Service 
 Fund to focus on broadband establishing the Connect America Fund Already the 
 Connect America Fund has made investments that will make broadband available 
 to 1.6 million unserved Americans and just days ago the Commission voted to 
 move forward with Phase II of the Connect America Fund 
 As part of our universal service reforms we are making a major effort to recast 
 the E rate program to assist schools and libraries in securing broadband 
 services at advantageous prices   Here is a place where you can and should apply 
 the expertise you have developed in supplying broadband services to small and 
 medium size businesses If you can configure good service and good deals to 
 SMEs you can and should do it for our schools and libraries 
 That the security of broadband networks is a matter of utmost significance and 
 urgency is not news We are at a critical juncture The more we learn about the 
 challenges of cybersecurity and the costs of failure the more apparent the 
 importance of addressing it with best efforts including yours We know that these 
 are non trivial issues   We also know that the best solutions come from when we 
 work together to identify   solutions and get them implemented throughout the 
 industry   This must be done in a deliberate responsible and transparent fashion 
 that balances security privacy and innovation 
 Cable is already working with the FCC to do just that within our Communications 
 Security Reliability and Interoperability Council CSRIC   We expect the outcome 
 of CSRIC ’s work to be an industry led effort to proactively assess cyber readiness 
 within your companies communicate your risk assessments with your boardrooms 
 and share relevant elements of the assessments between partners in the larger 
 ecosystem And we expect this to be done in such a way that those charged with 
 oversight across the regulatory tapestry recognize and understand the accepted 
 cyber risk The CSRIC workgroup is leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
 as a starting point for this Over the course of the year we will need to see this 
 translate into actual implementation   We ’re intending this to be a new regulatory 
 paradigm and we ’re giving you the opportunity to write it I urge you to step up 
 so we do n’t have to 
 In addition to ensuring the availability and security of our broadband networks 
 we have to assure the openness of the networks and the Internet for all lawful 
 uses   I have said plenty about that today and you can be assured that I will raise 
 it every time I am invited to address an NCTA gathering 
 But I would add one more point today One of the most effective tools for ensuring 
 Internet openness is competition I developed a great deal of my regulatory 
 philosophy in the days when cable was fighting to be allowed to compete   As you 
 probably have heard the mantra today at the FCC is Competition Competition 
 Competition Competition promotes efficient pricing technical progressiveness 
 consumer protection and yes private investment 
 Case in point AT&T just announced plans to expand fiber networks that can 
 deliver 1 Gigabit per second service to up to 100 communities I applaud Randall 
 Stephenson for his initiative and see this as a challenge to the cable industry 
 similar to the advent of DBS   I hope you respond in a similar manner as you did 
 back then   You stand where you are today in large part as a result of how you 
 expanded your networks to meet competition from the sky I am hopeful you will 
 respond competitively once again   If you do this new competition will provide 
 ever improving   to the benefit of the public 
 This latest news does not change the historical fact that for many parts of the 
 communications sector there has n’t been as much competition as consumers and 
 innovation deserve   Given the high fixed costs and consequent scale economies 
 this is n’t especially surprising   But that makes it all the more important that we 
 knock down public and private barriers to competition and avoid erecting new 
 ones It is equally important that we encourage competition wherever it is 
 possible 
 One place where it may be possible is municipally owned or authorized broadband 
 systems   I understand that the experience with community broadband is mixed 
 that there have been both successes and failures   But if municipal governments 
 the same ones that granted cable franchises want to pursue it they should n’t be 
  I have said before that I believe the FCC has the power 
 and I intend to exercise that power to preempt state laws that ban competition 
 from community broadband 
 Throughout this discussion of how to promote the availability security and 
 openness of world class broadband networks you ’ll note that in every instance I 
 spoke not only of the FCC ’s responsibilities but also of your industry ’s 
 As I said at the beginning when it comes to broadband the cable industry has 
 important technical advantages a leading market position and very limited 
 regulation   It is to engage in understatement an unusual situation   The only way 
 to maintain this situation is to uphold your responsibilities If you do it will 
 benefit not only your industry but it will also contribute to the prosperity 
 security and values of our nation",0.0121912639588117,0.009147560223937,0.0025211081374436,0.296346515417099,0.6243916153907776,0.0231353137642145,0.0322665870189666,0.1816353447603447,0.4819734750984749,37.45382702172884,0.2785025524673851,0.007822277847309137,0.049191848208011243,0.048678720445062586,25.648,0.0
101,L. Paul Bremer III,Keynote Address at the TD Waterhouse Investment Conference,2005," Thank you Thank you Thank you very much Thank you very much 
 Thank you Gene for that nice introduction 
 I 've been in San Diego now for a couple of days and I have been impressed by the 
 growth of the economy here I was with the San Diego Regional Economic 
 Development Corporation last night and they were talking about how much they 
 have increased employment here And one of the CEO 's told me a story about a 
 recent job application at his company where three people applied for a job There 
 was a mathematician an accountant and an economist who applied for the job 
 And the HR guy called the first applicant in who was the mathematician and asked 
 him a simple question 
 He said What does 2 + 2 equal 
 And the mathematician said 4 
 And the HR guy said Exactly 4 
 And the mathematician in exasperation said Yeah exactly 4 always 
 all the time 
 So then he called in the accountant and said same question What does 
 2 + 2 equal 
 And the accountant said Well 4 plus or minus 10 depending on the 
 circumstances 
 And then they called the economist in same question What does 2 + 
 2 equal 
 And the economist went over to the window and pulled down the 
 shades closed the curtains went over and locked the door came and 
 sat down next to the HR guy right beside him at the desk and said It 
 depends on what you want it to equal 
 So I hope there are some economists among you out there 
 Let me begin if I  you participate in a simple question and 
 answer With a show of hands I 'd be interested to see how many of you 
 remember where you were on September 11th 2001 just a show of hands 
 Well look around the room It tells you what you need to know September 11th 
 was as the President said in his 2nd Inaugural a day of fire It was a day which 
 basically changed America forever And like everybody in this room I was shocked 
 by what happened on September 11th but I was not surprised 
 Gene mentioned that I had been privileged to Chair the bipartisan National 
 Commission on terrorism That Commission predicted to President Clinton and to 
 the Congress of the United States fifteen months before September 11th that we 
 should we should anticipate mass casualty attacks on a Pearl Harbor scale by 
 Islamic extremists on the American homeland 
 How did we reach that conclusion We reached that 
 evidence   And before I talk about that I want to 
 say that today I want to try to connect my view of the war on terrorism with what 
 is happening in Iraq I want to try to cover both subjects But first let me tell a 
 story on myself 
 I was as Gene mentioned Ambassador at large for counterterrorism in charge 
 of our country 's counterterrorism programs in the late 1980 's And in that position 
 we worked very closely with our European allies against the old kind of terrorists 
 that we were facing 
 In 1987 the French police found a large cache of explosives buried in a secret 
 place in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.¹ They staked out the cache and arrested 
 some men who came to pick up these explosives The French Minister of Interior 
 called me that afternoon and said Mr. Ambassador you better come over to Paris 
 right away I have to tell you about this arrest we made So I flew over that night 
 and the next morning he told me that these men had admitted to being members 
 of Hezbollah a Lebanese terrorist group and that they were going to use these 
 explosives in casual in attacks trying to kill many many Frenchmen But what 
 was interesting was not that It was their objective Their stated objective was to 
 create the Islamic Republic of France the Islamic Republic of France Now in 
 1987 this struck me as something of a fantastic idea But in fact these men 
 though I did n't know it at that time represented the face of the new terrorism 
 that the National Commission reported on 
 By way of background the old terrorists the people we fought in the 70 's and 80 's 
 were groups of men who used terrorism as a tactical device to draw attention to 
 their cause They did n't want to kill a lot of people They just wanted to kill enough 
 to get in the newspapers there so they could talk about their objectives In 
 effect the old terrorists practiced self restraint in the number of people they 
 killed 
 When we on the National Commission started looking at the facts of terrorism in 
 the 1990 's we found three disturbing trends which contradicted the old kind of 
 terrorism The first was that while the number of terrorist incidents in the 1990 's 
 was going down the number of casualties was going up The second fact was that 
 suicide bombings and suicide deaths in terrorism were increasing dramatically 
 whereas there 'd been almost no suicides before in the 1970 's and 80 's And thirdly 
 we found that the states which supported terrorism prominent among them Iraq 
 were all developing weapons of mass destruction And so it was our view in The 
 National Commission on Terrorism that these three trends in the 1990 's told us 
 something about a new kind of terrorist a trend towards mass casualty 
 terrorism 
 What did we know and what do we know now about the motives of these people 
 Who are they Well first of all they 've been remarkably open in their objectives 
 We in the National Commission studied their statements their fatwas their press 
 conferences and of course now you can study what they say on their web sites 
 And they are very clear For more than a decade these people have said that they 
 have the objective of  necessary all of the world to their 
 extreme vision of Islam And their extreme vision of Islam is an Islam which is 
 necessarily at war with the West at war with the West not just because they hate 
 the superficialities of western civilization but because they hate the very 
 foundations of western civilization the separation of Church and State universal 
 suffrage women 's education and above all they hate democracy And rather than 
 showing restraint in their terrorism these terrorists intentionally want to kill as 
 many people as possible 
 You may remember that after the first attack on the World Trade Center which as 
 in February of 1993 we captured a number of the perpetrators And they 
 confessed that their objective had been to kill 250,000 Americans So they 've 
 been very open about their objectives They 've been very open about wanting to 
 kill thousands of people And the new dimension which makes these terrorists 
 particularly terrifying is the possibility that they could get their hands on nuclear 
 biological chemical or radiological agents which would give them the capability of 
 killing us in the hundreds of thousands In effect these new terrorists have 
 declared a civil war inside Islam They are trying to define Islam as inevitably at 
 war with the West And most of the victims around the world have in fact been 
 fellow Muslims I will get back to that when I talk about Iraq 
 Now when I speak to a group like this almost always there comes a question 
 afterwards about the root cause of terrorism so I 'll spare you that question by 
 answering it now What is the root cause Why ca n't we do something about the 
 root cause of terrorism Well ladies and gentlemen it should be clear from what 
 I 've said that the root cause of this terrorism is nothing less than our existence 
 the existence of western civilization They make this very clear You can You can 
 look You can go to the book and look it up They hate us for what we are and 
 there 's no compromise with these people There 's no neutral ground 
 It 's a fair question then to follow up and say But why do they hate us so 
 much It 's certainly not because of poverty They 're not joining these groups out 
 of poverty Those guys who killed 3000 Americans on September 11th were all 
 well educated upper middle class Arabs Bin Laden is a centimillionaire His chief 
 ideologist Al Zawahri is a well educated upper class Egyptian doctor Bernard 
 Lewis who is president who is Professor Emeritus at Princeton University and 
 I think one of the most observant followers of Islam in this country believes that 
 a lot of this hatred is self hatred and it comes out of the fact that in his view the 
 Arab Islamic countries have not found a way to reconcile themselves to the 
 modern world And he goes back and traces it over the last 300 years This envy 
 and self hatred is the swamp out of which the hatred comes he says And I think 
 it 's a fair assessment And if it 's true it has important implications for the 
 situation in Iraq and in the Arab world in general that I will get back to 
 But just to conclude on terrorism this nexus between these world hating Islamic 
 extremists and their desire to kill   of thousands and the 
 possibility of weapons of mass destruction is the national security threat to the 
 United States at the beginning of the 21st century They are deadly serious they 
 are prepared to die for their cause and we have to be just as serious ourselves 
 Now let me turn to Iraq 
 President Bush has said that the war to liberate Iraq is part of the war on 
 terrorism And he 's right Let 's let the facts speak for themselves First of all 
 American administrations of both political parties for more than two decades have 
 identified Iraq as a state which supports terrorism And it did it did under 
 Saddam Hussein They supported Palestinian terrorists He gave safe haven to 
 notorious Palestinian terrorists like Abu Nidal He supported Iraqi Iranian 
 terrorists groups And as the 911 Commission reported this fall there were 
 contacts between Al Qaeda and members of Saddam 's government running back a 
 decade Moreover since 1998 it had been the stated policy of the American 
 government to seek regime change in Baghdad That was a policy which was 
 passed in a   of  overwhelming 
 majorities of both Parties in this country in 1998 and signed into law it was 
 the law of the land to seek regime change signed into law  by 
 President Bill Clinton 
 So I think with the situation being what it was at the end of 2002 sanctions 
 eroding no inspections in Iraq for four years the   United 
 States but also sic the intelligence services of Britain France Germany Russia 
 and other countries that Saddam was still developing weapons of mass destruction 
 President Bush did the right thing in seeking to carry out the law by seeking 
 regime change The status quo was simply not stable 
 Now let me turn if I can to Iraq and answer two questions I often get What was 
 it like And how are we doing What was it like Well you will have read that we 
 worked and lived in a palace one of many dozens of palaces that Saddam Hussein 
 wasted money on But it was certainly not easy living We had when I arrived no 
 electricity no running water no telephones On the plus side of having no 
 electricity we had no communications from Washington for some time which is 
 the good news The bad news was there was no air conditioning And when I 
 arrived on May 12th the temperature was already 115 degrees regularly during 
 the day And that meant that in the palace if you were lucky the temperature was 
 only 100 On June 14th the temperature hit 138 and as a good New England boy 
 this felt kind of warm to me until an Iraqi friend said Wait till summer comes 
 We lived in a world of Meals Ready to Eat for some time the military issue Meals 
 Ready to Eat until we were able to get a mess hall established in the palace 
 where we served 10,000 meals a day It was healthy food it was good for you but 
 it was not very imaginative And I I used to say to my colleagues You know 
 you 've been here too long when you start looking forward to your next meal 
 My staff in the CPA grew to more than 3000 civilians from more than 25 different 
  It was a fully international operation Every one of them 
 was a volunteer They came to Iraq for no reason other than to help the Iraqis 
 rebuild their country They worked 18 to 20 hours a day 7 days a week for 14 
 months It was an exhausting operation and they did it in very dangerous 
 circumstances with regular mortar and rocket attacks on our compound attacks 
 on our convoys as we moved around the country As Gene mentioned I I was 
 able to survive a number of assassination attempts myself 
 Now let me turn to what kind of an Iraq we found before I talk about where I 
 think we are It sometimes is neglected now with all the discussion about the 
 elections and the security problems it 's important to go back and remember 
 what kind of a brutal tyranny was upon this land And the evidence of Saddam 's 
 brutality was everywhere Saddam Hussein when he came to power made it very 
 clear that he modeled his control of society on Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin He 
 admired the Nazis and the Soviet Communists for their capacity to control the 
 entire society And so his Bathe Party his army his security services were all 
 dedicated to single minded control over his own people And if you stepped out of 
 line torture or death were likely to be meted out quickly 
 My first week there I traveled about 50 miles south of Baghdad to the first of the 
 many mass graves which we uncovered in Iraq You may remember that after the 
 1991 war the first Gulf War the Shia who inhabit most of the area south of 
 Baghdad rose up against Saddam He crushed this rebellion mercilessly sweeping 
 through having his armies sweep through the towns and pick up men women 
 and children indiscriminately and taking them out into pastures machine gunning 
 them and putting them into large open pit graves 
 The grave that I visited in Al Hillah south of Baghdad that day we estimated had 
 20 to 30,000 bodies in it Some of them very small babies As As we looked over 
 this grave which is the site of the size say of three times of a football field 
 you could see women scrabbling at the dirt with their bare hands trying to find 
 evidence of whether this pile of bones was a relative Was there a faded identity 
 card a piece of jewelry a fragment of clothing that identified the person Human 
 Rights Watch estimates that during his reign Saddam killed at least 300,000 of his 
 own citizens Nobody will ever know what the true number is because there are 
 more than a million and a half Iraqis still missing 
 During the next few weeks as I moved around Iraq I found other signs of 
 Saddam 's tyranny I visited the small Kurdish town of Halabja in the northeast of 
 the country up on the Iranian border where on one sunny March morning in 1988 
 Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to kill 5000 of his fellow countrymen 
 all of them Kurds And I talked to the survivors many of them horribly disfigured 
 by having survived these chemical attacks In every one of the 151 police stations 
 in the country there was a torture chamber I saw those And in most police 
 stations there was a rape room including in the Baghdad central police academy 
 And talked to the survivors of the rape rooms As I moved around the country I 
 also saw the human shredding machines that Saddam used against his opponents 
 His instructions to his cronies were to put the victims in feet first so they died or 
 they 'd die more slowly 
 Now I am sorry to say things like this while you 're eating lunch But I suppose 
 there are some of you in this room who did n't support the war as would not 
 surprise me But let me give you a challenge ladies and gentlemen Let me just 
 ask you this Go to Iraq and visit those mass graves Go up to Halabja and talk to 
 some of the survivors of the chemical attack Talk to some of the women who 
 survived the rape rooms Talk to the relatives of the people killed over a period of 
 almost four decades And then come back here and tell me you think we were 
 wrong to liberate this country We did the right thing 
 Now when we hit the ground there in early May we faced a staggering range of 
 issues This had been the most dramatic collapse of any regime in recent history 
 far more rapid and dramatic than the collapse for example in Central Europe and 
 the Soviet Union in 1989 1990 Because in the case of those countries the collapse 
 had really started the reforms had started as early as the 1970 's for example in 
 Hungary and   80 's even in Russia But in Iraq they went 
 from this pitch black tyranny to freedom in three short weeks And that had 
 profound implications for the challenges we faced  for the 
 expectation of the Iraqi people We needed to get action in three areas right away 
 We needed to take steps to get the economy going we needed to begin the 
 process of political reform and of course we had to deal with the security 
 problem 
 Let me say a word about each of these three points First on the economy which 
 may be of interest particularly to this audience It 's hard to express how 
 devastated this economy was but by 
 Saddam 's incompetence In a way the system combined the worst features of 
 tyranny which always leads to corruption and a blind faith in bureaucratic control 
 that 's characteristic of Socialism They had had this for 35 years and the result 
 was a spectacular misallocation of capital across the entire economy with very 
 devastating impact on the economy of the country 
 Let me give you just a few metrics The UN found that between 1979 which was 
 when Saddam finally consolidated total power between 1979 and 2002 per 
 capita GDP dropped more in Iraq than any country in the world including the 
 countries of Africa which did not have a great 1990 's either During the 1990 's 
 Saddam cut health care spending in the country by 90 so that I found when 
 we got the documents that in a in a population of 27 million people Saddam 
 had allocated in 2002 seventeen million dollars for health care The World Bank 
 reported that Iraq then had the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant 
 mortality rate of any country in the region Education fared no better A UN report 
 said that all of Iraq 's schools needed refurbishing At least half needed to be 
 completely rebuilt Student overcrowding was such that often there was as many 
 as 180 students in a room 
 In this fabled land between the rivers Mesopotamia there was a water crisis The 
 World Bank found that everyday at the end of 2002 this is all before the war 
 some 500,000 tons of raw sewage everyday were being dumped into the Tigris 
 and Euphrates rivers Almost all of Iraq 's state owned enterprises were bankrupt 
 at a direct cost of a billion dollars a year to the budget and of course 
 uncountable billions more in misallocated capital and labor The banking system 
 was bankrupt The banking system basically was like the system in the Soviet 
 Union or today in China It made its loans on the basis of bureaucratic and political 
 dictates not according to commercial dictates 
 We knew we had a budget crisis but we did n't know how big it was because as in 
 the Soviet Union the budget under Saddam Hussein was a state secret As we dug 
 into it we found to our surprise that only 8 of the budget was actually run 
 through the formal structure of the government through the ministries 92 of 
 the budget was spent directly out of the presidential   his 
 cronies We did know that we were likely to go   of 2003 or by the 
 first quarter of 2004 Subsidies for food and energy themselves accounted for 60 
 of likely revenues We faced the consequences of Saddam 's extraordinary fiscal 
 indiscipline During the 1990 's to cover his budgets he simply ran the printing 
 presses His own ministry of planning told us that at the end of 2002 inflation in 
 Iraq was running at the annual rate of get this of 115,000 I could go on 
 but you get the picture If Iraq had been a corporation we were deep in Chapter 
 11 and headed for Chapter 7 very soon We faced an economic crisis every bit as 
 great as that this country faced in the Great Depression 
 I immediately set out a plan of action in the economy on two dimensions First in 
 the immediate sense to get consumption going and get the economy turning over 
 and second to make steps toward long range economic reform Getting the 
 economy going was urgent because unemployment was between 50 and 60 It 
 was not clear exactly where it was but it was high Incidentally before the war it 
 was also 50 But since much of the industry the state industry was closed 
 we had to assume the number was now probably more like 60 
 The trouble was as the government we were the largest employer Millions of 
 people in the civil service depended on us and as did pensioners But they 
 had n't been paid for almost three months 
 As my advisors went through the ministries to try to find out what the payroll 
 system was they found chaos There was no unified grade system for paying 
 people in the civil service Every ministry had its own system and every system 
 had its own kickbacks bonuses commissions and bribes built into it It was 
 obvious that it would take us months to sort it out and we could n't wait months to 
 start paying people So I simply decreed a 4 grade a very simple 4 grade civil 
 service pay system the week after I got there and we started paying the civil 
 servants But as always is the case in Iraq nothing is that easy because as I 
 mentioned the banking system was not only bankrupt it was closed down None 
 of the banks were open 
 So we had in order to pay the civil servants and pensioners we had to effectively 
 move cash around the country to pay people out on their payrolls This meant 
 moving about 175 million dollars a month out in a country with lousy roads and a 
 war going on It was not easy to put it mildly I also immediately allocated 
 several hundred million dollars from the Iraqi budget for urgent public works 
 programs to stimulate jobs And we created several hundred thousand jobs over 
 the next three months We established a crash program to reform and establish 
 good essential services We I increased health care spending in 2003 by 
 3,200 We reopened all 240 hospitals and 95 of the health clinics We 
 increased drug distribution by 400 All of this was done within three months We 
 increased power generation tenfold by July 1st 75 of the bank branches were 
 opened by July 15th   the school year opened on October 1st we 
 had rebuilt over 2000 schools and school enrollment jumped 20 
 But in the long run we also knew we had to reform the underlying macroeconomic 
 policies of this country And here too we made some bold decisions First we 
 established a policy of zero tariffs at the borders We simply did away with all 
 import duties This had the effect of stimulating 
 importation of cars television sets white goods and for the first time in history 
 satellite dishes for television We eliminated Saddam Hussein 's prohibition against 
 foreign direct investment in Iraq And I signed into law on September 16th 2003 
 what the Economist Magazine says is the most liberal foreign direct investment 
 law anywhere in the world I established for the first time fiscal responsibility by 
 approving balanced budgets for both 2003 and 2004 And I put them on the path 
 to monetary   Central Bank again for the first time in 
 Iraq 's history independent of the government on July 7th 2003 We freed interest 
 rates so the Central Bank no longer determined interest rates they 're 
  And we licensed foreign banks to enter Iraq 
 We cut taxes on both businesses and individuals and we simplified business 
 proced[ures Business procedures used to be the typical cumbersome thing if 
 you wanted to set up a business of going from ministry to ministry to ministry 
 and no doubt paying a bribe and then a bribe and a bribe You can now register a 
 business one stop shopping in ten days in Iraq By the way that last I 
 checked it still takes 45 days in Germany We modernized and strengthened the 
 patent copyright and trademark laws and we reopened the stock market this 
 June 
 One of the early problems we had was what to do about the currency As I 
 mentioned the currency was of course greatly depreciated and there were 
 competing and illegal foreign exchange dealings going on We decided we had to 
 replace the entire currency the entire stock of currency This involved thousands 
 of tons of currency being brought in and thousands leaving We The new 
 currency alone filled twenty seven 747 's We distributed this currency around the 
 country in a three month period from October 15th to January 1st January 15th 
 in a country at war with no roads no telephones and no banks without a single 
 incident By the way during that period the new Iraqi dinar as it 's called 
 strengthened 20 against the dollar We floated it freely 
 The balance sheet on the economy I think is rather good The economy has great 
 underlying strength because of the wealth of the country and the skill of its 
 people Reconstruction is going forward During the fourteen months I was there 
 we completed some 20,000 individual reconstruction projects many of them small 
 rebuilding a school or putting windows in a municipal center or giving a 
 generator to a hospital but those are the kinds of reconstruction projects that 
 change people 's lives Oil production Oil production is running above two million 
 barrels a day We got it above prewar levels of 2.6 million barrels a day but 
 sabotage in the last couple of months has brought it back down Power generation 
 runs at 50 above prewar levels now Inflation which had been a major problem 
 when we arrived in December was 3 The annual rate was a little less than 
 30 Unemployment measured unemployment is now less than 20 probably a 
 third of what it was at liberation And in the urban areas I think it 's at probably 
 half of that Thanks to U.S. leadership Iraq 's huge foreign debt run up by Saddam 
 Hussein has been largely forgiven So with better security I am confident 
 investment will come in A lot of domestic capital has already been mobilized And 
 Iraq will have again a great leading place in the economy with better security 
 Let me turn to the second area political reform which of course is much in the 
 news these days We first had to clean out the old system to get rid of these 
 killers of Saddam Hussein 's and his army his security forces his Bathe Party 
 and usher in a process for new political reform Fifteen months ago working with 
 Iraqis I laid out a clear path to take Iraq from where it was to representative 
 government And we have followed that path every step of it since then 
 including most recently of course the great victory of the elections this Sunday 
 Pundits here consistently underestimated both the Iraqi 's determination to carry 
 this path out and the American government 's determination to help them 
 We are I think particularly I am particularly proud of the Constitution which I 
 signed in March last year the interim constitution which has the most robust 
 Bill of Rights of any country in the region providing for complete equality of all 
 individuals irrespective of gender race nationality or religion complete freedom 
 of expression and assembly freedom of religion the right of the innocent to be 
 considered innocent until proven guilty the right to a free and open trial the right 
 to habeas corpus the right to legal council I outlawed the second week I was 
 there torture Torture is no longer allowed And the Constitution provides for a 
 balance of power among the three branches of government similar to ours but 
 different and of course confirms the independent judiciary which I had 
 established a year ago 
 Now there will be bumps in the road ahead And no doubt there will be tricky 
 negotiations now in the aftermath of these elections But the path from tyranny to 
 freedom is never smooth It 's often   kinds of things 
 Looting where you have crime and mobs storming government buildings the 
 breakdown of government structures and institutions that used to maintain civil 
 order rampant inflation supporters of the former regime prowling in the cities 
 and in the countryside and delays and bickering over the formation of the new 
 government 
 Ladies and gentlemen if those characteristics sound familiar to you they should 
 What I just described was the United States of America in 1783 And I tell this 
 story because I think it 's important for Americans to be a bit more patient and 
 have a slightly longer historical view of the situation in Iraq After all it took us 
 seven years to win our independence and twelve years before we wrote our 
 Constitution We did n't develop political parties for twenty years Iraq has done all 
 of that in less than two years There will be problems but the key is the process is 
 started there is a path ahead and I am confident the Iraqis will follow it 
 Let me talk finally about the security situation People ask who is it who is who 
 we 're fighting there Well there are two groups There are the ex Saddam 
 supporters the sadists and killers from Saddam 's regime whose only vision is to 
 take Iraq back to the tyranny of Saddam In fact their Party is called The Party of 
 Return It tells you all you need to know about their vision it 's a the vision of the 
 past And there are the professional killers and terrorists from Al Qaeda whose 
 vision is equally simple and very clear They make it clear They want to establish 
 a government like the Taliban in Afghanistan with all that means Neither of 
 these parties has a vision that appeals to the Iraqi people And both of these 
 parties are at heart avowedly anti democratic So it 's no wonder they opposed the 
 elections and tried to intimidate the Iraqi people 
 It is extraordinary I think when you consider the kind of courage the Iraqi people 
 have showed not just on Sunday in the elections but in the run up Despite all the 
 intimidation the Iraqis went to the polls They were poll watchers They continue 
 to come to be recruited into the police and the security forces They are literally 
 dying for democracy It is I think a --a profound statement of the Iraqi view of 
 the future 
 From the outset our job was to get the Iraqis as quickly as possible able to 
 defend their own country So we set up the largest police training program in 
 world history We established a program to reestablish an Iraqi army and we 
 came up with the idea of creating a National Guard These three forces today have 
 something like 136,000 men on their rosters And as Secretary Rumsfeld says in 
 his piece today in the Wall Street Journal they performed on the whole extremely 
 well during the election and the run up to the election But they are of variable 
 quality There 's no doubt about it And he quoted George Washington 's concern in 
 the midst the depth really of our own revolution as pointing out that it takes 
 time to create effective military forces 
 Now let me bring it back to where I started and talk a bit about terrorism and the 
 terrorists in Iraq The 911 Commission as I said found evidence of contacts 
 between Al Qaeda and Saddam 's government going back throughout the 90 's The 
 leader of Al Qaeda there is this fellow you 've been reading about Abu Musab Al 
 Zarqawi a Jordanian He was granted safe   2001 He 's called 
 by Bin Laden the Prince of Al Qaeda in Iraq And these terrorists understand 
 fully that Iraq is on the frontline of terrorism They understand and admit the 
 dangers of a pluralistic Iraq to them In a press statement that he released on 
 December 27th Bin Laden condemned these elections as un Islamic because they 
 would put man and not God in charge of Iraq Zarqawi seven days before the 
 election declared what he called a bitter war against this evil principle of 
 democracy As long ago as 15 months ago Zarqawi in a message to his followers 
 said There is no place for us in a democratic Iraq So the terrorists understand 
 full well what the stakes are there and that where tyranny thrives terrorism 
 thrives 
 The President the other night in his State of the Union Address put it this way 
 He said The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and 
 replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom The Iraqis understand 
 that the terrorists understand that And Al Qaeda 's leaders understand that when 
 we succeed in Iraq terrorism fails And when they fail the impact will go way 
 beyond Iraq because if Bernard Lewis is right then an Iraq which can be both 
 Islamic and modernizing which can reconcile itself to the modern world and to 
 peace with the western civilization will be a beacon of hope for Iraqis but also for 
 other Muslims in the area This has huge potential geo political benefits for the 
 United States and for the people in the region 
 Let me conclude with two final observations First of all I 'm optimistic as you 
 probably can understand about the prospects for Iraq I accept that there will be 
 hard times ahead But Iraq is rich country rich in water and oil and most of all 
 rich in people as we saw on Sunday courageous people The vast majority of 
 Iraqis are delighted to be liberated They do not want to go back to the past They 
 have no truck at all with the terrorists The balance of power in Iraq today is with 
 democracy Again the President said it well on Wednesday night He said We will 
 succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and 
 to write their own history 
 Second observation We Americans are involved in a just and noble project in Iraq 
 one which is vital to the war on terrorism There 's good news and bad news about 
 this struggle against terrorism The bad news is that we are really only at the 
 beginning of it in my view We stand in many ways at an historic crossroads that is 
 similar to that we faced in 1945 when we could begin to see emerging a new 
 enemy in that case it was Soviet Communism and we had to find the strategy 
 to deal with it So too now we can see emerging a new threat and we have to find 
 the strategies to deal with it The struggle is likely to define American national 
 security policy for a generation just as the struggle against Soviet Communism 
 did That 's the bad news 
 The good news is we can do this We just we did it before We just need be 
 patient tough minded and consistent as we were in the war against Soviet 
 Communism My study of American history suggests that we will succeed and that 
 we will not fail the challenge that has been presented to us here at the beginning 
 of the 21st century

102,Hillel Neuer,Address to the United Nations Council on Human Rights,2007," Thank you Mr. President 
 Six decades ago in the aftermath of the Nazi horrors Eleanor Roosevelt Réné 
 Cassin and other eminent figures gathered here on the banks of Lake Geneva to 
 reaffirm the principle of human dignity They created the Commission on Human 
 Rights Today we ask What has become of this noble dream 
 In this session we see the answer   Faced with compelling reports from around the 
 world of torture persecution and violence against women what has this Council 
 pronounced What has it decided Nothing Its response has been silence Its 
 response has been indifference Its response has been criminal One might say in 
 Harry Truman ’s words that this has become a Do Nothing Good for Nothing 
 Council 
 But that would be inaccurate This Council has after all done something It has 
 enacted one resolution after another condemning one single state Israel In eight 
 pronouncements and there will be three more this session Hamas and 
 Hezbollah have been granted impunity The entire rest of the world millions 
 upon millions of victims in 191 countries continue to go ignored 
 So yes this Council has done something And the Middle East dictators who 
 orchestrate this campaign will tell you it is a very good thing and that they seek 
 to protect human rights Palestinian rights 
 So too the racist murderers of Darfur women the rapists of Darfur women tell us 
 they care about the rights of Palestinian women the occupiers of Tibet care about 
 the occupied and the butchers of Muslims in Chechnya care about Muslims 
 But do these self proclaimed defenders truly care about Palestinian rights 
 Let us consider the past few months More than 130 Palestinians were killed by 
 Palestinian forces This is three times the combined total that were the pretext for 
 calling special sessions in July and November Yet the champions of Palestinian 
 rights Ahmadinejad Assad Khaddafi John Dugard say nothing Little 
 3 year old boy Salam Balousha and his two brothers were murdered in their car 
 by Prime Minister Haniyeh ’s troops Why has this Council chosen silence 
 Because Because Israel could not be blamed Because in truth the despots who 
 run this Council could n’t care less about Palestinians or about any human rights 
 They seek to demonize Israeli democracy to delegitimize the Jewish state to 
 scapegoat the Jewish people   They also seek something else To distort and 
 pervert the very language and idea of human rights 
 You ask What has become of the founders dream Of Eleanor Roosevelt of Réné 
 Casssin of John Humphrey P.C. Chang Charles Malik who assembled here in 
 Geneva sixty years ago   Mr. President with terrible lies and moral inversion this 
 Council is turning that dream into a nightmare

103,George P. Shultz,Terrorism and the Modern World,1984," Off Site Audio of Address 
 
 Thank you very much I truly appreciate the warmth of your welcome especially 
 as it comes after a a wonderful dinner beautiful cooking and the warmth and 
 hospitality that you have Where are you showed us We really do appreciate 
 it And we had the you mentioned that President Eisenhower stood here and 
 of course I 'm thrilled to stand here in any case but to to speak at a pulpit from 
 whitexaplanch he spoke My first full time job in Washington was during the 
 Eisenhower Administration I served as in his council of economic advisors So 
 you can see how old I am 
 brief interruption and cross talk re speaker microphone positioning 
 It 's also a privilege for me to deliver this annual lecture Sherr Lecture and 
 particularly since it comes at the start of your year of adult Jewish studies And 
 I 've just seen this booklet and it does look interesting and as an old time 
 professor of course I have to recommend education to everybody 
 You 've assigned me a topic that I think is of tremendous importance so I 'm glad 
 to have a chance to reflect on it with you We The invitation to give the lecture 
 has caused us to think carefully about what to say on this subject and if it 's a 
 little lengthy I apologize but nevertheless it 's an important topic so I hope you 'll 
 bear with me as I go through my thoughts 
 Someday terrorism will no longer be a timely subject for a speech but that day 
 has not arrived Less than two weeks ago one of the oldest and greatest nations 
 of the Western world almost lost its Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to the 
 modern barbarism that we call terrorism A month ago the American Embassy 
 Annex in East Beirut was nearly   truck bomb the third 
 major attack on Americans in Lebanon within the past two years To list all the 
 other acts of brutality that terrorists have visited upon civilized society in recent 
 years would be impossible here because the list is too long It is too long to name 
 and too long to tolerate 
 But I 'm here to talk about terrorism as a phenomenon in our modern world about 
 what terrorism is and what it is not We have learned a great deal about terrorism 
 in recent years We 've learned much about the terrorists themselves their 
 supporters their diverse methods their underlying motives and their eventual 
 goals What once may have seemed the random senseless violent acts of a few 
 crazed individuals has come into clearer focus A pattern of terrorist violence has 
 emerged It is an alarming pattern but it is something that we can identify and 
 therefore a threat that we can devise concrete measures to combat The 
 knowledge we have accumulated about terrorism over the over the years can 
 provide the basis for a coherent strategy to deal with the phenomenon if we have 
 the will to turn our understanding into action 
 We have learned that terror terrorism is above all a form of political violence 
 It is neither random nor without purpose Today we are confronted with a wide 
 assortment of terrorist groups which alone or in concert orchestrate acts of 
 violence to achieve distinctly political ends Their stated objectives may range 
 from separatist causes to revenge for ethnic grievances to social and political 
 revolution Their methods may be just as diverse from planting homemade 
 explosives in public places to suicide car bombings to kidnappings and political 
 assassinations 
 But the overarching goal of all terrorists is the same They are trying to impose 
 their  special kind of force designed to create an atmosphere of 
 fear The horrors they inflict are not simply a new manifestation of traditional 
 social conflict they are depraved opponents of civilization itself aided by the 
 technology of modern weaponry The terrorists want people to feel helpless and 
 defenseless they want people to lose faith in their government 's capacity to 
 protect them and thereby undermine the legitimacy of the government itself or its 
 policies or both 
 The terrorists profit from the anarchy   They succeed when 
 governments change their policies out of intimidation But the terrorist can even 
 be satisfied if a government responds to   on individual 
 rights and freedoms Governments that overreact even in self defense may only 
 undermine their own legitimacy as they unwittingly serve the terrorists goals 
 The terrorist succeeds if a government responds to violence with repressive 
 polarizing behavior that alienates the government from the people 
 We must understand however that terrorism wherever it takes place is directed 
 in an important sense against us the democracies against our most basic values 
 and often our fundamental strategic interests Because terrorism relies on brutal 
 violence as its only tool it will always be the enemy of democracy For democracy 
 rejects the indiscriminate or improper use of force and relies instead on the 
 peaceful settlement of disputes through legitimate political processes 
 The moral bases of democracy the principles of individual rights freedom of 
 thought and expression freedom of religion are powerful barriers against those 
 who seek to impose their will their ideologies or their religious beliefs by force 
 Whether i[n Israel or Lebanon or Turkey or Italy or West Germany or Northern 
 Ireland a terrorist has no patience for the orderly processes of democratic 
 society and therefore he seeks to destroy it Indeed terrorism seeks to destroy 
 what all of us here are seeking to build 
 The United States and the other democracies are morally committed to certain 
 ideals and to a humane vision of the future Nor is our vision limited to within our 
 borders In our foreign policies as well we try to foster the kind of world that 
 promotes peaceful settlement of disputes one that welcomes beneficial change 
 We do not practice terrorism and we seek to build a world which holds no place for 
 terrorist violence a world in which human rights are respected by all 
 governments a world based on the rule of law 
 And there is yet another reason why we are attacked If freedom and democracy 
 are the targets of terrorism it is clear that totalitarianism is its ally The number 
 of terrorist incidents in totalitarian states is minimal and those against their 
 personnel abroad are markedly fewer than against the West And this is not only 
 because police states offer less room for terrorists to carry out acts of violence 
 States that support and sponsor 
 terrorist actions have managed in recent years to co opt and manipulate the 
 terrorist phenomenon in pursuit of their own strategic goals 
 It is not a coincidence that most acts of terrorism occur in areas of importance to 
 the West More than 80 of the world 's terrorist attacks in 1983 occurred in 
 Western Europe Latin America and the Middle East Terrorism in this context is 
 not just criminal activity but an unbridled form of warfare 
 Today international links among terrorist groups are more clearly understood 
 And Soviet and Soviet bloc support is also more clearly understood We face a 
 diverse family of dangers Iran and the Soviet Union are hardly allies but they 
 both share a fundamental hostility to the West When Libya and the PLO Palestine 
 Liberation Organization provide arms and training to the communists in Central 
 America they are aiding Soviet supported Cuban efforts to undermine our security 
 in that vital region 
 When the Red Brigades in Italy and the Red Army Faction in Germany assault free 
 countries in the name of communist ideology they hope to shake the West 's 
 self confidence unity and will to resist intimidation The terrorists who assault 
 Israel and indeed the Marxist Provisional IRA Irish Republican Army in 
 Northern Ireland are ideological enemies of the United States We can not and 
 we will not succumb to the likes of Khomeini and Gaddafi 
 We also now see a close connection between terrorism and international narcotics 
 trafficking Cuba and Nicaragua in particular have used narcotics smugglers to 
 funnel guns and money to terrorists and insurgents in Colombia Other communist 
 countries like Bulgaria have also been part of the growing link between drugs 
 and terrorism 
 We should understand the Soviet role in international terrorism without 
 exaggeration or distortion One does not have to believe that the Soviets are 
 puppeteers and the terrorists terrorists marionettes violent or fanatic 
 individuals and groups can exist in almost any society 
 But in many countries terrorism would long since have withered away had it not 
 been for significant support from outside When Israel went into Lebanon in 1982 
 Israeli forces uncovered irrefutable evidence that the Soviet Union had been 
 arming and training the PLO and other groups Today there is no reason to think 
 that Soviet support for terrorist groups around the world has diminished Here as 
 elsewhere there is a wide gap between Soviets words and Soviet deeds a gap 
 that is very clear for instance when you put Soviet support for terrorist groups up 
 against the empty rhetoric of the resolution against so called state terrorism 
 which the U.S.S.R has submitted to this year 's UN General Assembly The Soviets 
 condemn terrorism but in practice they connive with terrorist groups when they 
 think it serves their own purposes and their goal is always the same to weaken 
 liberal democracy and undermine world stability 
 The stakes in our war against terrorism therefore are high We have already seen 
 the horrible cost in innocent lives that terrorist violence has incurred But perhaps 
 even more horrible is the damage that terrorism threatens to wreak on our 
 modern civilization 
 For centuries mankind has strived to build a world in which the highest human 
 aspirations can be fulfilled We have pulled ourselves out of a state of barbarism 
 and removed the affronts to human freedom and dignity that are inherent to that 
 condition We have sought to free ourselves from that primitive existence 
  life is lived in continual fear and danger of violent 
 death nasty brutish and short ""1 We have sought to create instead a world 
 where universal respect for human rights and democratic values makes a better 
 life possible We in the democracies can attest to all that man is capable of 
 achieving if he renounces violence and brute brute force if he is free to think 
 write vote and worship as he pleases Yet all of these hard won won gains are 
 threatened by terrorism 
 Terrorism is a step backward It is a step toward anarchy and decay In the 
 broadest sense terrorism represents a return to barbarism in the modern age If 
 the modern world can not face up to the challenge then terrorism and the 
 lawlessness and inhumanity that come with it will gradually undermine all that 
 the modern world has achieved and make further progress impossible 
 The magnitude of the threat   so great that we can not afford 
 to confront it with half hearted and poorly organized measures Terrorism is a 
 contagious disease that will inevitably spread if it goes untreated We need a 
 strategy to cope with terrorism in all of its varied manifestations We need to 
 summon the necessary resources and determination to fight it and with 
 international cooperation eventually stamp it out And we have to recognize that 
 the burden falls on us the democracies No one else will cure the disease for us 
 Yet clearly we face obstacles some of which arise precisely because we are 
 democracies The nature of the terrorist assault is in many ways alien to us 
 Democracies like to act on the basis of known facts and shared knowledge 
 Terrorism is clandestine and  rely on secrecy and 
 therefore it is hard to know for certain who has committed an atrocity 
 Democracies also rely on reason and persuasive logic to make decisions It is hard 
 for us to understand the fanaticism and apparent irrationality of many terrorists 
 especially those who kill and commit suicide in the belief that they will be 
 rewarded in the afterlife The psychopathic ruthlessness and brutality of terrorism 
 is an aberration in our culture and alien to our heritage 
 And it is an unfortunate irony that the very qualities that make democracies so 
 hateful to the terrorists our respect for the rights and freedom of the individual 
 also make us particularly vulnerable Precisely because we maintain the most 
 open societies terrorists 
 have unparalleled opportunity to strike at us Terrorists seek to make democracies 
 embattled and afraid to break down democratic accountability due process and 
 order They hope we will turn toward repression or succumb to chaos 
 These are the challenges we must live with We will certainly not alter the 
 democratic values that we so cherish in order to fight terrorism We will have to 
 find ways to fight back without undermining everything we stand for 
 But there is another obstacle that we have created for ourselves and that we 
 should overcome that we must overcome if we are to fight terrorism effectively 
 The obstacle I am referring to is confusion 
 We can not begin to address this monumental challenge to decent civilized society 
 until we clear our heads of the confusion about terrorism in many ways the moral 
 confusion that still seems to plague us Confusion can lead to paralysis and it is a 
 luxury that we simply can not afford 
 The confusion about terrorism has taken many forms In recent years we have 
 heard some ridiculous distortions even about what the word terrorism means 
 The idea for instance that denying food stamps to some is a form of terrorism 
 can not be   And those who would argue as recently 
 some in Great Britain have that physical   be equated with 
 the violence of unemployment are in the words of The Economist a menace to 
 democracy everywhere ""2 In a real democracy violence is unequivocally bad Such 
 distortions are dangerous because words are important When we distort our 
 language we may distort our thinking and we hamper our efforts to find solutions 
 to the grave problems we face 
 There has been however a more serious kind of confusion surrounding the issue 
 of terrorism the confusion between the terrorist act itself and the political goals 
 that the terrorists claim to seek 
 The grievances that terrorists supposedly seek to redress through acts of violence 
 may or may not be legitimate The terrorist acts themselves however can never 
 be legitimate And legitimate causes can never justify or excuse terrorism 
 Terrorist means discredit their ends 
 We have all heard the insidious claim that one man 's terrorist is another man 's 
 freedom fighter When I spoke on the subject of terrorism this past June I 
 quoted the powerful rebuttal to this kind of moral relativism 
 Senator Henry Jackson His statement bears repeating today The idea that one 
 person 's terrorist is another 's freedom fighter he said 
 can not be sanctioned Freedom fighters or revolutionaries do n't blow up 
 buses containing non combatants terrorist murderers do 
 Freedom fighters do n't set out to capture and slaughter school children 
 terrorist murderers do 
 Freedom fighters do n't assassinate innocent businessmen or hijack and 
 hold hostage innocent men women and children terrorist murderers 
 do 
 It is a disgrace that democracies would allow the treasured word 
 freedom to be associated with acts of terrorist[s].3 
 So spoke Scoop Jackson 
 We can not afford to let an Orwellian corruption of language obscure our 
 understanding of terrorism We know the difference between terrorists and 
 freedom fighters and as we look around the world we have no trouble telling one 
 from the other 
 How tragic it would be if democratic societies so lost confidence in their own 
 moral legitimacy that they lost sight of the obvious that violence directed against 
 democracy or the hopes for democracy lacks fundamental justification 
 Democracy offers the opportunity for peaceful change legitimate political 
 competition and redress of grievances We must oppose terrorists no matter what 
 banner they may fly For terrorism in any cause is the enemy of freedom 
 And we must not fall into the deadly trap of giving justification to the 
 unacceptable acts of   worthy sounding motives 
 they may claim Organizations such as the Provisional IRA for instance play on 
 popular grievances and political and religious emotions to disguise their deadly 
 purpose They find ways to work through local political and religious leaders to 
 enlist support for their brutal actions As a result we even find Americans 
 contributing we hope unwittingly to an organization which has killed in cold 
 blood and without the slightest remorse hundreds of innocent men women and 
 children in Great Britain and Ireland an organization which has assassinated 
 senior officials and tried to assassinate the British Prime Minister and her entire 
 cabinet a professed Marxist organization which also gets support from Libya 's 
 Gaddafi and has close links with other international terrorists The Government of 
 the United States stands firmly with the Government of the United Kingdom and 
 the Government of Ireland in opposing any action that lends aid or support to the 
 Provisional IRA 
 Moral confusion about terrorism can take many forms When two Americans and 
 12 Lebanese were killed at our Embassy Annex in East Beirut last month for 
 instance we were   this mass murder was an expression albeit 
 an extreme expression of Arab hostility to American policy in the Middle East We 
 were told that this bombing happened because of a vote we cast in the United 
 Nations or because of our policies in Lebanon or because of the overall state of 
 our relations with the Arab nations or because of our support for Israel 
 We were   if we want to stop terrorism if we want to put an 
 end to these vicious murders   then what we need to do is change our policies In 
 effect we have been told that terrorism is in some measure our own fault and we 
 deserved to be bombed I can tell you here and now that the United States will not 
 be driven off or stayed from our course or change our 
 We can not permit ourselves any uncertainty as to the real meaning of terrorist 
 violence in the Middle East or anywhere else Those who truly seek peace in the 
 Middle East know that war and violence are no answer Those who oppose 
 radicalism and support negotiations are themselves the target of terrorism 
 whether they are Arabs or Israelis One of the great tragedies of the Middle East 
 in fact is that the many moderates on the Arab side who are ready to live in 
 peace with Israel are   and their terrorist henchmen and 
 are thus stymied in their own efforts for peace 
 The terrorists principal goal in the Middle East is to destroy any progress toward 
 a negotiated peace And the more our policies succeed the closer we come toward 
 achieving our goals in the Middle East the harder terrorists will try to stop us The 
 simple fact is the terrorists are more upset about progress in the Middle East than 
 they are about any alleged failures to achieve progress Let us not forget that 
 President Sadat was murdered because he made peace and that threats continue 
 to be issued daily in that region because of the fear yes fear that others 
 might favor a negotiated path toward peace 
 Whom would we   policies in the Middle East in the face of 
 the terrorist threat Not Israel not the moderate Arabs not the Palestinian 
 people and certainly not the cause of peace Indeed the worst thing we could do 
 is change our principled policies under the threat of violence What we must do is 
 support our friends and remain firm in our goals 
 We have to rid ourselves of this moral confusion which lays the blame for terrorist 
 actions on us or on our policies We are attacked not because of what we are doing 
 wrong but because of what we are doing right We are right to support the 
 security of Israel and there is no terrorist act or threat that will change that firm 
 determination We are attacked not because of some mistake we are making but 
 because of who we are 
 and what we believe in We must not abandon our principles or our role in the 
 world or our responsibilities as the champion of freedom and peace 
 While terrorism threatens many countries the United States has a special 
 responsibility It is time for this country to make a broad national commitment to 
 treat the challenge of terrorism with the sense of urgency and priority it deserves 
 The essence of our response is simple to state Violence and aggression must be 
  This principle holds true whether we are responding to 
 full scale military attacks or to the kinds of low level conflicts that are more 
 common in the modern world 
 We are on the way to being well prepared to deter an all out war or a Soviet 
 attack on our principal allies that is why these are the least likely contingencies 
 It is not self evident that we are as well prepared and organized to deter and 
 counter the gray area of intermediate challenges that we are more likely to face 
 the low intensity conflict of which terrorism is a part 
 We have worked hard to deter large scale 
 strategic and conventional  pride and confidence of the 
 men and women in our military   kind of national resolve to 
 confront aggression that can deter potential adversaries We have been more 
 successful than in the past in dealing with many forms of low level aggression 
 We have checked communist aggression and subversion in Central America and 
 the Caribbean and opened the way for peaceful democratic processes in that 
 region And we successfully liberated Grenada from Marxist control and returned 
 that tiny i[s]land to freedom and self determination 
 But terrorism which is also low a form of low level aggression has so far posed 
 an even more difficult challenge for the technology of security has been 
  of murder And of course the United States is not 
 the only nation that faces difficulties in responding to terrorism To update 
 President Reagan 's report in the debate last Sunday since September 1st 41 acts 
 of terrorism have been   than 14 terrorist groups against the 
 people and property of 21 countries Even Israel has not rid itself of the terrorist 
 threat despite its brave and prodigious efforts 
 But no nation has had more experience with terrorism than Israel and no nation 
 has made a greater contribution to our understanding of the problem and the best 
 ways to confront it By supporting organizations like the Jonathan Institute 
 named after the brave Israeli soldier who led and died at Entebbe the Israeli 
 people have helped raise international awareness of the global scope of the 
 terrorist threat 
 And Israel 's contribution goes beyond the the theoretical Israel has won major 
 battles in the war against terrorism in actions across its borders in other 
 continents and in the land of Israel itself To its great credit the Israeli 
 Government has moved within Israel to apprehend and bring to trial its own 
 citizens accused of terrorism 
 Much of Israel 's success in fighting terrorism has been due to broad public support 
 for Israel 's antiterrorist policies Israel 's people have shown the will and they 
 have provided their government the resources to fight terrorism They entertain 
 no illusions about the meaning or the danger of terrorism Perhaps because they 
 confront the threat everyday they recognize that they are at war with terrorism 
 The rest of us would do well to follow Israel 's example 
 But part of our problem here in the United States has been our seeming inability to 
 understand terrorism clearly Each successive terrorist incident has brought too 
 much self condemnation and dismay   a change in our 
 policies or our principles or calls for withdrawal and retreat We should be 
 alarmed We should be outraged We should investigate and strive to improve 
 But widespread publish public anguish and self condemnation only convince the 
 terrorists that they are on the right track It only encourages them to commit 
 more acts of barbarism in the hope that American resolve will weaken This is a 
 particular danger in the period before our election If our reaction to terrorist acts 
 is to turn on ourselves instead of against the perpetrators we give them 
 redoubled incentive to do it again and to try to influence our political processes 
 We have to be stronger steadier determined and united in the face of the 
 terrorist threat We must not reward the   policies or 
 questioning our own principles or wallowing in self flagellation or self doubt 
 Instead we should understand that terrorism is aggression and like all 
 aggression must be forcefully resisted 
 We must reach a consensus in this country that our responses should go beyond 
 passive defense to consider means of active prevention preemption and 
 retaliation Our goal must be to prevent and deter future terrorist acts and 
 experience has taught us over the years that one of the best deterrents to 
 terrorism is the certainty that swift and sure measures will be taken against those 
 who engage in it 
 We should take steps toward carrying out such measures There should be no 
 moral confusion on this issue Our aim is not to seek revenge but to put an end to 
 violent attacks against innocent people to make the world a safer place to live 
 for all of us Clearly the democracies have a moral right indeed a duty to defend 
 themselves 
 A successful strategy for combating terrorism will require us to face up to some 
 hard questions and to come up with some clear cut answers The questions 
 involve our intelligence capability the doctrine under which we would employ 
 force and most important of all our public 's attitude toward this challenge Our 
 nation can not summon the will to act without firm public understanding and 
 support 
 First our intelligence capabilities particularly our human intelligence are being 
 strengthened Determination and capacity to act are of little value unless we can 
 come close to answering these the questions Who Where And when We 
 have to do a better job of finding out who the terrorists are where they are and 
 the nature composition and patterns of behavior of terrorist organizations Our 
 intelligence services are organizing themselves to do the job and they must be 
 given the mandate and the flexibility to develop techniques of detection and 
 contribute to deterrence and response 
 Second there is no question about our ability to use force where and when it is 
 needed to counter terrorism Our nation has forces prepared for action from 
 small teams able to operate virtually undetected to the full weight of our 
 conventional military might But serious issues are involved questions that need 
 to be debated understood and agreed if we are to be able to utilize our forces 
 wisely and effectively 
 If terrorists strike here at home it is a matter for police action and domestic law 
 enforcement In most cases overseas acts of terrorism against our people and 
 installations can be dealt with   government and its forces It is 
 worth remembering that just as it is the responsibility of the United States 
 Government to provide security for foreign embassies in Washington so the 
 internationally agreed doctrine is that the security of our embassies abroad in the 
 first instance is the duty of the host government and we work with those 
 governments cooperatively and with considerable success The ultimate 
 responsibility of course is ours and we will carry it out with total determination 
 and all the resources available to us Congress in a bipartisan effort is giving us 
 the legislative tools and the resources to strengthen the protection of our facilities 
 and our people overseas and they must continue to do so But while we 
 strengthen our defenses defense alone is not enough 
 The heart of the challenge lies in those cases where international rules and 
 traditional practices do not apply Terrorists will strike from areas where no 
 governmental authority exists or they will base themselves behind what they 
 expect will be the sanctuary of an international border And they will design their 
 attacks to take place in precisely those gray areas where the full facts can not be 
 known where the challenge will not bring with it an obvious or clear cut choice of 
 response 
 In such cases we must use our intelligence resources carefully and completely 
 We will have to examine the full range of measures available to us to take The 
 outcome may be that we will face a choice between doing nothing or employing 
 military force We now recognize that terrorism is being 
 as a modern tool of warfare It is no aberration We can expect more terrorism 
 directed at our strategic interests around the world in the years ahead To combat 
 it we must be willing to use military force 
 What will be required however is public understanding before the fact of the 
 risks involved in combating terrorism with overt power 
 The public must understand before the fact that there is potential for loss of life of 
 some of our fighting men and the loss of life of some innocent people 
 The public must understand before the fact that some will seek to cast any 
 preemptive or retaliatory   the worst light and will attempt to make 
 our military and our policymakers rather than the terrorists appear to be the 
 culprits 
 The public must understand before the fact that occasions will come when their 
 government must act before each and every fact is known and the decisions 
 can not be tied to the opinion polls.4 
 Public support for U.S. military actions to stop terrorists before they commit some 
 hideous act or in retaliation for an attack on our people is crucial if we are to deal 
 with this challenge 
 Our military has the capability and the techniques to use power to fight the war 
 against terrorism This capability will be used judiciously To be successful over 
 the long term it will require solid support from the American people 
 I can assure you that in this Administration our actions will be governed by the 
 rule of law and the rule of law is congenial to action against terrorists We will 
 need the flexibility to respond to terrorist attacks in a variety of ways at times 
 and places of our own choosing Clearly we will not respond in the same manner 
 to every terrorist act Indeed we will want to avoid engaging in a policy of 
 automatic retaliation which might create a cycle of escalating violence beyond our 
 control 
 If we are going to respond or preempt effectively our policies will have to have an 
 element of unpredictability and surprise And the prerequisite for such a policy 
 must be a broad public consensus on the moral and strategic necessity of action 
 We will need the capability to act on a moment 's notice There will not be time for 
 a renewed national debate after every terrorist attack We may never have the 
 kind of evidence that can stand up in an American court of law But we can not 
 allow ourselves to become the Hamlet of nations,5 worrying endlessly over 
 whether and how to respond A great nation with global responsibilities can not 
 afford to be   indecisiveness Fighting terrorism will 
 not be a clean or pleasant contest but we have no choice but to play it 
 We will also need a broader international effort If terror terrorism is truly a 
 threat to Western moral values our morality must not paralyze us it must give us 
 the courage to face up to the threat And if the enemies of these values are united 
 so too must the democratic countries be united in in defending them The 
 leaders of the industrial democracies meeting at the London summit in June 
 agreed on a joint declaration that they must redouble their cooperation against 
 terrorism.6 There has been a follow up to that initial meeting and the United 
 States is committed to advance the process in every possible way Since we the 
 democracies are the most vulnerable and our strategic interests are the most at 
 stake we must act together in the face of danger common dangers For our 
 part we will work where whenever possible in close cooperation with our 
 friends in the democracies 
 Sanctions when exercised in concert with other nations can help to isolate 
 weaken or punish states that sponsor terrorism against us Too often countries 
 are   losing commercial opportunities or fear of provoking a 
 bully Economic sanctions and other forms of countervailing pressure impose costs 
 and risks on the nations that apply them but some sacrifices will be necessary if 
 we are not to suffer even greater costs down the road Some countries are clearly 
 more vulnerable to extortion than others Surely this is an argument for banding 
 together in mutual support not an argument for appeasement 
 If we truly believe in the values of our civilization we have a duty to defend them 
 The democracies must have the self confidence to tackle this menacing problem or 
 else they will not be in much of a position to tackle other kinds of problems If we 
 are not willing to set limits to what kinds of behavior are tolerable then our 
 adversaries will conclude that there are no limits As Thomas Jefferson once said 
 when we were confronted with the problem of piracy an insult unpunished is the 
 parent of others ""7 
 In a basic way the democracies must show whether they believe in themselves 
 We must confront the terrorist threat with the same resolve and determination 
 that this nation has shown time and again throughout our history There is no 
 room for guilt or self doubt about our right to defend a way of life that offers all 
 nations hope for peace progress and human dignity The sage Hillel expressed it 
 well If I am not for myself who will be If I am for myself alone who am I?8 
 As we fight this battle against terrorism we must always keep in mind the values 
 and way of life we are trying to protect Clearly we will not allow ourselves to 
 descend to the level of barbarism that terrorism represents We will not abandon 
 our democratic traditions our respect for individual rights and freedom for these 
 are precisely what we are struggling to preserve and promote Our values and our 
 principles will give us the strength and the confidence to meet the great challenge 
  we show the courage and the will to protect our freedom 
 and our way of life we will prove ourselves again worthy of these blessings

104,Angela Merkel,Address to the Nation on the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak,2020," Fellow citizens 
 The coronavirus is changing daily life in our country dramatically at the present 
 Our idea of normality of public life social togetherness all of this is being put to 
 the test as never before 
 Millions of you can not go to work your children can not go to school or 
 kindergarten theaters and cinemas and shops are closed and perhaps what is 
 most difficult we all miss social encounters that we otherwise take for granted Of 
 course each of us has many questions and concerns in a situation like this about 
 the days ahead 
 I ’m addressing you in this unconventional way1 today because I want to tell you 
 what guides me as Federal Chancellor and all my colleagues in the Federal 
 Government in this situation This is part of what open democracy is about that 
 we make political decisions transparent and explain them that we justify and 
 communicate our actions as best we can so that people are able to understand 
 them 
 I firmly believe that we will pass this test if all citizens genuinely see this as 
 THEIR task 
 Allow me therefore to say that this is serious Please also take this seriously 
 Since German reunification no since the Second World War there has not been a 
 challenge for our country in which action in a spirit of solidarity on our part was so 
 important 
 I would like explain where we currently stand in this epidemic and what the 
 Federal Government and the state levels are doing to protect everyone in our 
 community and to limit the economic social and cultural fallout However I also 
 want to tell you why all of you are needed here and what each and every 
 individual can do to help 
 As far as the epidemic is concerned and everything I tell you about this comes 
 from the Federal Government ’s ongoing consultations with the experts from the 
 Robert Koch Institute and other scientists and virologists the most intensive 
 research is being conducted around the world but there is still neither a way to 
 treat the coronavirus nor is there a vaccine 
 As long as this is the case and this is what is guiding all of our actions then 
 only one thing matters namely that we slow the spread of the virus flatten the 
 curve over the course of several months and buy time Time in which the research 
 community can develop a medicine and vaccine But above all time to allow those 
 who fall ill to receive the best possible treatment 
 Germany has an excellent healthcare system perhaps one of the best in the world 
 We can take solace in this But our hospitals would also be completely 
 overwhelmed if in the shortest space of time too many patients were admitted 
 suffering severe symptoms as a result of the virus 
 These are not just abstract numbers in statistics but this is about a father or 
 grandfather a mother or grandmother a partner this is about people And we 
 are a community in which each life and each person counts 
 I would like first of all to address all those who as doctors nurses or in a different 
 capacity work in our hospitals and in our healthcare system in general You are on 
 the front lines of this fight for us You are the first to see the sick and to see how 
 severe the symptoms of the virus can sometimes be And day in day out you 
 keep going back to work and are there to help people You are doing tremendous 
 work and I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart 
 So our aim is to slow the virus down as it makes its way through Germany And 
 we must and this is absolutely vital focus our attention on one thing above all 
 else namely powering down public life as far as possible with reason and a 
 sense of proportion of course since the state will continue to function It goes 
 without saying that supply chains will continue to be guaranteed and we want to 
 keep as much economic activity going as possible 
 But we must now reduce everything that could put people at risk everything that 
 could harm not only individuals but also the community We must limit the risk of 
 one person infecting another as much as we possibly can 
 I know how dramatic the restrictions already are no events no trade fairs no 
 concerts any more and for the time being also no school no university no 
 kindergarten no more playing at the playground I know how invasive the 
 closures that the Federation and the Länder have agreed to are in our lives and 
 also in terms of how we see ourselves as a democracy These are restrictions the 
 likes of which the Federal Republic has never seen before 
 Allow me to assure you that for someone like me for whom the freedom of travel 
 and the freedom of movement were a hard fought right,2 such restrictions can 
 only be justified if they are absolutely imperative These should never be put in 
 place lightly in a democracy and should only be temporary But they are vital at 
 the moment in order to save lives 
 This is why since the beginning of the week more intensive border controls and 
 restrictions on entry for a number of our most important neighboring countries 
 have been in force 
 Things are already very difficult for the economy for major companies and also 
 for small businesses for shops restaurants and freelancers Things will get even 
 more difficult in the weeks to come 
 I assure you that the Federal Government is doing everything that it can to 
 cushion the economic impact and above all to safeguard jobs 
 We can and we will do whatever it takes in order to help our companies and their 
 employees get through this most difficult time 
 And everyone can rest assured that the food supply is guaranteed at all times and 
 that if supermarket shelves happen to be empty on one day they will be filled 
 again on the next I want to tell everyone going to the supermarket that 
 bulk buying makes sense it always has But only within reason Panic buying as if 
 there ’s no tomorrow is pointless and at the end of the day shows a complete 
 lack of solidarity 
 And allow me to express my thanks to those who are too seldom thanked those 
 working as supermarket cashiers or restocking shelves who are currently doing 
 one of the most difficult jobs that there are at the moment Thank you for being 
 there for your fellow citizens and for keeping us all going 
 Let me talk now about what I believe is most urgent today All measures taken by 
 the state would come to nothing if we were to fail to use the most effective means 
 for preventing the virus from spreading too rapidly and that is we ourselves As 
 indiscriminately as each one of us can be each and every one 
 of us must help first and   what matters today not 
 panicking but also not thinking for a single moment that he or she does n’t matter 
 after all No one is expendable Everyone counts and we need a collective effort 
 That is the message an epidemic brings home how vulnerable we all are how 
 much we depend on the considerate behavior of others and ultimately how 
 through joint action we can protect ourselves and offer one another 
 encouragement and support 
 Every individual counts We are not condemned to accept the spread of this virus 
 as an inevitable fact of life We have the means to fight it We must be considerate 
 and keep a safe distance from one another Virologists are giving us clear advice 
 no more handshakes we must wash our hands thoroughly and often and we must 
 keep at least one and a half meter 's distance between ourselves and others 
 Ideally we should avoid all contact with the elderly because they are particularly 
 at risk 
 I know that this is asking a great deal of us Especially when times are hard we 
 want to be close to one another We show and by 
 reaching out to each other But at this time we must do the exact opposite Every 
 single one of us must understand that right now the only way to show we care is 
 by keeping our distance 
 A well meant visit or a trip that is not essential can spread infection and really 
 should not take place right now There is a reason why experts say that 
 grandparents and grandchildren should not come into contact with each other 
 right now 
 Everyone who avoids unnecessary encounters helps all those who are in hospitals 
 providing care to more and more people each day So that is how we will save 
 lives This will be difficult for many and it will also be important not to abandon 
 anyone and to take care of all those who need a dose of cheer and encouragement 
 As families and as a society we will find other ways to help each other 
 Even now we have come up with many creative ideas for standing up to this virus 
 and its impact on society Even now grandchildren are recording podcasts for 
 their grandparents letting them know they are not alone 
 We all must discover how we can show affection and express friendship We are 
 staying in touch via Skype phone email and maybe -fashioned 
 letters The post postal mail after all is being delivered We ’re hearing about 
 beautiful examples of neighbors helping one another People are assisting the 
 elderly who can not themselves go shopping I am certain there ’s plenty more we 
 can do We will prove as a community that we will not abandon one another 
 I therefore urge you to   that will remain in place for the time 
 being The government will constantly reassess what measures can be adjusted 
 and also what further measures may still be necessary 
 This is a developing situation and we will ensure that we continue to learn from it 
 so that we can adjust our thinking and deploy new instruments at any time If we 
 do so then we will explain our reasons once again 
 Therefore I call on you to not believe any rumors but rather only the official 
 messages that we will always translate into many languages 
 We are a democracy We thrive not because we are forced to do something but 
 because we share knowledge and encourage active participation This is a historic 
 task and it can only be mastered if we face it together 
 I have absolutely no doubt that we will overcome this crisis But how many victims 
 will it claim How many loved ones will we lose The answer to a great extent 
 lies in our hands Right now we can take decisive action all together We can 
 accept these current limitations and support one another 
 The situation is serious and the outcome uncertain Our success will also largely 
 depend on how disciplined each and every one of us is in following the rules 
 Even though this is something we have never experienced before we must show 
 that we can act warm heartedly and rationally and thereby save lives It is up to 
 each and every one of us to do so without any exception 
 Take good care of yourself and your loved ones

105,Adlai Stevenson,UN General Assembly Address on the Death of John F. Kennedy,1963," Mr. President my dear colleagues 
 My privilege in this sad hour is to convey to you Mr. President to you Mr. 
 Secretary General and to you the assembled delegates of the world community a 
 profound gratitude of the people of my country for what has been done and for 
 what has been said here today Our grief is the more bearable because it is so 
 widely and so genuinely shared And for this we can only say simply but from the 
 depths of our full hearts thank you 
 President Kennedy was so contemporary a man so involved in our world so 
 immersed in our times so responsive to its challenges so intense a participant in 
 the great events and the great decisions of our day that he seemed the very 
 symbol of the of the vitality and the exuberance that is the essence of life itself 
 Never once did he lose his way in the maze Never once did he falter in the storm 
 of spears Never once was he intimidated Like the ancient Prophets he loved the 
 People enough to warn them of their errors and the man who loves his country 
 best will hold it to its highest standards 
 He made us proud to be Americans 
 And so it is that after four sorrowful days we still can hardly grasp the macabre 
 reality that the world has been robbed of this vibrant   act 
 conceived in estranged recesses of the human mind 
 We shall not soon forget the late President 's striving ambition for his own country 
 his concept of a permanently dynamic society spreading abundance to the last 
 corner of this land and extending justice tolerance and dignity to all of its 
 citizens alike 
 For we shall not soon forget that as the leader of a great nation he met and 
 mastered his responsibility to wield great power with great restraint Our 
 national strength matters he said just a few weeks ago but the spirit which 
 informs and controls out strength matters just as much ""¹ 
 We shall not soon forget that he held fast to the vision of a world in which the 
 peace is secure in which inevitable conflicts are   in 
 which nations devote their energies to the welfare of all of their citizens and in 
 which the vast and colorful diversity of human society can flourish in our restless 
 competitive search for a better society 
 We shall not soon forget   by deed he gave proof of profound 
 confidence in the present value and the future promise of this great organization 
 the United Nations 
 And we shall never forget these ambitions these visions these convictions that so 
 inspired this remarkable young man and so quickened the quality and the tempo of 
 our times in these fleeting past three years 
 And our grief is   irony that he who gave his all to contain 
 violence lost is all to violence 
 Now he 's gone Today we mourn him Tomorrow and tomorrow we shall miss him 
 And so we shall never know how different the world might have been had fate 
 permitted this blazing talent to live and labor longer at man 's unfinished agenda 
 for peace and progress for all 
 Yet for the rest of us life goes on Our agenda remains unfinished Minutes after 
 his spirit departed Lyndon B. Johnson took his oath of allegiance to the 
 permanent institutions of this country institutions which outlast violence and 
 outlive men These hours of mourning are then but a pause in a process not a 
 break in purpose or in policy 
 President Johnson has directed me to affirm to this Assembly that there will be no 
 Johnson policy toward the United Nations any more than there was a Kennedy 
 policy There was and is only a United States policy and that too outlasts 
 violence and outlives men 
 As long ago as 1948 President Johnson told an American audience that our long- 
 term and sustained foreign policy must include full support of the United Nations 
 And now on his behalf and I repeat to you that my government will as it has over 
 the years support every practical move to add to the capacity of the United 
 Nations to keep the peace and to aid new nations to reach the stage of 
 self sustaining growth 
 The foreign policy of this government will continue to be as to the troubling issues 
 of today and tomorrow to work for agreement where agreement is possible and 
 to negotiate with patience and persistence until agreement is possible President 
 Johnson is determined that the better feeling of these past few months shall not 
 be lost rather that it must be increased In that spirit we shall not falter on the 
 stony path to peace 
 Finally let me say that John Kennedy never believed that he or any man was 
 indispensable as several speakers have reminded us here this afternoon Of Dag 
 Hammarskjold 's death he said The problem is not the death of one man the 
 problem is the life of this organization But he did believe passionately that 
 peace and justice are indispensable And he believed as he told this Assembly in 
 1951 that in the development of this organization lives the only true alternative to 
 war 
 So my friends we shall honor him in the best way that lies open to us and the

106,Queen Elizabeth II,Victory Europe Day 75th Anniversary Address,2020," King George VI Let us remember the men in all the services of the women and all 
 of the services who have laid down their lives We have come to the end of our 
 tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing.1 
 Queen Elizabeth II I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did 
 exactly 75 years ago His message then was a salute to the men and women at 
 home and abroad who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a 
 great deliverance 
 The war had been a total war it had affected everyone and no one was immune 
 from its impact Whether it be the men and women called up to serve families 
 separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to 
 support the war effort all had a part to play At the start the outlook seemed 
 bleak the end distant the outcome uncertain But we kept faith that the cause 
 was right and this belief as my father noted in his broadcast carried us 
 through 
 Never give up never despair that was the message of VE Day I vividly 
 remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and 
 Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace The sense of joy in the 
 crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound though while 
 we celebrated the victory in Europe we knew there would be further sacrifice It 
 was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended 
 Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict They fought so we could 
 live in peace at home and abroad They died so we could live as free people in a 
 world of free nations They risked all so our families and neighborhoods could be 
 safe We should and will remember them 
 As I now reflect on my father ’s words and the joyous celebrations which some of 
 us experienced first hand I am thankful for the strength and courage that the 
 United Kingdom the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed 
 The wartime generation knew that the best way to honor those who did not come 
 back from the war was to ensure that it did n’t happen again The greatest tribute 
 to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends 
 working   the peace health and prosperity of us all 
 Today it may seem hard that we can not mark this special anniversary as we 
 would wish Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps But our 
 streets are not empty they are filled with the love and the care that we have for 
 each other And when I look at our country today and see what we are willing to 
 do to protect and support one another I say with pride that we are still a nation 
 those brave soldiers sailors and airmen would recognize and admire 
 I send my warmest good wishes to you all",0.0025484890211373,0.0042606606148183,0.0108488444238901,0.7933862209320068,0.0469461269676685,0.1370656192302703,0.0049441456794738,0.2646557743331936,0.6657764278732022,70.6417650462963,0.4479495268138801,0.00975609756097561,0.17573221757322174,0.148014440433213,25.625,0.0
107,Ronald Reagan,Second Inaugural Address,1985," Senator Mathias Chief Justice Burger Vice President Bush Speaker O'Neill 
 Senator Dole reverend clergy and members of my family and friends and my 
 fellow citizens 
 This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who for a time 
 has been absent Senator John Stennis God bless you and welcome back 
 There is however one who is not with us today Representative Gillis Long of 
 Louisiana left us last night And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent 
 prayer 
 Silence 
 Amen 
 There are no words to adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that 
 you 've bestowed on me I 'll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust This is as 
 Senator Mathias told us the 50th time that we the people have celebrated this 
 historic occasion When the first President George Washington placed his hand 
 upon the Bible he stood less than a single day 's   raw 
 untamed wilderness There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 states 
 Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 states We 've lighted the world 
 with our inventions gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a 
 cry for help journeyed to the Moon and safely returned So much has changed 
 and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago 
 When I took this oath four years ago I did so in a time of economic stress Voices 
 were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory But 
 we the present day Americans are not given to looking backward In this blessed 
 land there is always a better tomorrow Four years ago I spoke to you of a New 
 Beginning and we have accomplished that But in another sense our New 
 Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when for 
 the first time in history government the people said was not our master it is our 
 servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have 
 That system has never failed us but for a time we failed the system We asked 
 things of government that government was not equipped to give We yielded 
 authority to the National Government that properly belonged to states or to local 
 governments or to the people themselves We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us 
 of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had 
 made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of 
 unemployed increase 
 By 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength 
 toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society 
 We believed then and now There are no limits to growth and human progress 
 when men and women are free to follow their dreams And we were right and 
 we were right to believe that Tax rates have been reduced inflation cut 
 dramatically and more people are employed than ever before in our history 
 We are creating a nation once again vibrant robust and alive But there are many 
 mountains yet to climb We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness 
 of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright It is our birthright as 
 citizens of this great Republic 
 And if we meet this challenge these will be years when Americans have restored 
 their confidence and tradition of progress when our values of faith family work 
 and neighborhood were restated for a modern age when our economy was finally 
 freed from government 's grip when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms 
 reductions   defenses our economy and developing new 
 technologies helped preserve peace in a troubled world when America 
 courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty self government and 
 free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from 
 totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom 
 My fellow citizens our nation is poised for greatness We must do what we know 
 is right and do it with all our might Let history say of us These were golden 
 years when the American Revolution was reborn when freedom gained new life 
 and America reached for her best 
 Our two party system has solved us and served us I should say well over the 
 years but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came 
 together not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans united in a common 
 cause 
 Two of our Founding Fathers a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter 
 named Jefferson members of that remarkable group who met in Independence 
 Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again left us an important 
 lesson They had become in the years then in government bitter political rivals in 
 the Presidential election of 1800 Then years later when both were retired and 
 age had softened their anger they began to speak to each other again through 
 letters A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this 
 government of ours 
 In 1826 the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence they both died 
 They died on the same day within a few hours of each other and that day was the 
 Fourth of July 
 In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives Jefferson wrote 
 It carries me back to the times when beset with difficulties and 
 dangers we were fellow laborers in the same cause struggling for what 
 is most valuable to man his right of self government Laboring always 
 at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm 
 us and yet passing harmless we rode through the storm with heart and 
 hand 
 Well with heart and hand let us stand as one today one people under God 
 determined that our future shall be worthy of our past As we do we must not 
 repeat the well intentioned errors of our past We must never again abuse the 
 trust of working men and   earnings on a futile chase after 
 the spiraling demands of a bloated federal establishment You elected us in 1980 
 to end this prescription for disaster and I do n't believe you re elected us in 1984 
 to reverse course 
 At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of 
 economic growth Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial 
 genius that are the core of human progress We have begun to increase the 
 rewards for work savings and investment reduce the increase in the cost and 
 size of government and its interference in people 's lives We must simplify our tax 
 system make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn We 
 must think anew and move with a new boldness so every American who seeks 
 work can find work so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve 
 the greatest things to be heroes who heal our sick feed the hungry protect 
 peace among nations and leave this world a better place 
 The time has come for a new American emancipation a great national drive to 
 tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most 
 distressed areas of our country My friends together we can do this and do it we 
 must so help me God 
 From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth a more productive 
 fulfilled and united people and a stronger America an America that will lead the 
 technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures 
 of literature music and poetry and the values of faith courage and love 
 A dynamic economy with more citizens working and paying taxes will be our 
 strongest tool to bring down budget deficits But an almost unbroken 50 years of 
 deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning We 've come to a 
 turning point a moment for hard decisions I have asked the Cabinet and my staff 
 a question and now I put the same question to all of you If not us who And if 
 not now when It must be   us going forward with a program aimed 
 at reaching a balanced budget We can then begin reducing the national debt 
 I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government 
 program spending for the next year Beyond this we must take further steps to 
 permanently control government 's power to tax and spend We must act now to 
 protect future generations from government 's desire to spend its citizens money 
 and tax them into servitude when the bills come due 
 Let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the 
 federal government takes in 
 We have already started returning to the people and to state and local 
 governments responsibilities better  there is a place for the 
 federal government in matters of social compassion But our fundamental goals 
 must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or 
 disadvantaged And here a growing economy and support from family and 
 community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life 
 where the old and infirm are cared for the young and yes the unborn protected 
 and the unfortunate looked after and made self sufficient 
 Now there is another area where the federal government can play a part As an 
 older American I remember a time when people of different race creed or ethnic 
 origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and yes in 
 law There 's no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we 've 
 made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us Let us resolve 
 there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity 
 and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens 
 Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity society in 
 which all of us white and black rich and poor young and old will go forward 
 together arm in arm Again let us remember that though our heritage is one of 
 blood lines from every corner of the Earth we are all Americans pledged to carry 
 on this last best hope of man on Earth 
 I 've spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our 
 national government Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility 
 of national government the safety and security of our people 
 Today we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on 
 Earth Yet history has shown that peace does not come nor will our freedom be 
  alone There are those in the world who scorn our vision of 
 human dignity and freedom One nation the Soviet Union has conducted the 
 greatest military buildup in the history of man building arsenals of awesome 
 offensive weapons 
 We 've made progress in restoring our defense capability But much remains to be 
 done There must be no  any  America 
 will meet her responsibilities to remain free secure and at peace There is only 
 one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security and that is 
 to reduce the need for it And this we 're trying to do in negotiations with the 
 Soviet Union We 're not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear 
 weapons we seek instead to reduce their number 
 We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the 
 Earth 
 Now for decades we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual 
 assured destruction if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons the other 
 could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it Is there either logic or 
 morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people 
 our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs 
 I have approved a research program to find if we can a security shield that will 
 destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target It would n't kill people it 
 would destroy weapons It would n't militarize space it would help demilitarize the 
 arsenals of Earth It would render nuclear weapons obsolete We will meet with 
 the Soviets hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of 
 nuclear destruction We strive for peace and security   all 
 around us Since the turn of the century the number of democracies in the world 
 has grown fourfold Human freedom is on the march and nowhere more so than in 
 our own hemisphere Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the 
 human spirit People worldwide hunger for the right of self determination for 
 those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress 
 America must remain freedom 's staunchest friend for freedom is our best ally 
 and it is the world 's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace Every blow 
 we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and 
 war Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace 
 So we go forward today a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its 
 purpose With our alliances strengthened with our economy leading the world to a 
 new age of economic expansion we look to a future rich in possibilities And all of 
 this is because we worked and acted together not as members of political parties 
 but as Americans 
 My friends we we live in a world that 's  much is changing and 
 will change but so much endures and transcends time 
 History is a ribbon always unfurling History is a journey And as we continue our 
 journey we think of those who traveled before us We stand again at the steps of 
 this symbol of our democracy well we would have been standing at the steps if 
 it had n't gotten so cold Now we 're standing inside this symbol of our democracy 
 and we see and hear again the echoes of our past a general falls to his knees in 
 the hard snow of Valley Forge a lonely President paces the darkened halls and 
 powers ponders his struggle to preserve the Union the men of the Alamo call 
 out encouragement to each other a settler pushes west and sings a song and the 
 song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air 
 It is the American sound 
 It is hopeful big hearted idealistic daring decent and fair That 's our heritage 
 that 's our song We sing it still 
 For all our problems our differences we are together as of old 
 We raise our voices to the God who is the author of this most tender music And 
 may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound in unity 
 affection and love one people under God dedicated to the dream of freedom 
 that He has placed in the human heart called upon now to pass that dream on to a 
 waiting and a hopeful world

108,Mr. Fred Rogers,Senate Statement on PBS Funding,1969," 
 
 
 Senator Pastore Alright Rogers you 've got the floor 
 Mr. Rogers Senator Pastore this is a philosophical statement and would take about ten 
 minutes to read so I 'll not do that One of the first things that a child learns in a healthy 
 family is trust and I trust what you have said that you will read this It 's very important to 
 me I care deeply about children 
 Senator Pastore Will it make you happy if you read it 
 
 Mr. Rogers I 'd just like to talk about it if it 's alright My first children 's program was on 
 WQED fifteen years ago and its budget was $ 30 Now with the help of the Sears Roebuck 
 Foundation and National Educational Television as well as all of the affiliated stations each 
 station pays to show our program It 's a unique kind of funding in educational television With 
 this help now our program has a budget of $ 6000 It may sound like quite a difference but 
 $ 6000 pays for less than two minutes of cartoons 
  
  
 
                                  
 Two minutes of animated what I sometimes say bombardment I 'm very much concerned as 
 I know you are about what 's being delivered to our children in this country And I 've worked 
 in the field of child development for six years now trying to understand the inner needs of 
 children We deal with such things as as the inner drama of childhood We do n't have to 
 bop somebody over the head to make drama on the screen We deal with such things as 
 getting a haircut or the feelings about brothers and sisters and the kind of anger that arises 
 in simple family situations And we speak to it constructively 
 
 Senator Pastore How long of a program is it 
 
 Mr. Rogers It 's a half hour every day Most channels schedule it in the noontime as well as 
 in the evening WETA here has scheduled it in the late afternoon 
 
 Senator Pastore Could we get a copy of this so that we can see it Maybe not today but I 'd 
 like to see the program 
 
 Mr. Rogers I 'd like very much for you to see it 
 
 Senator Pastore I 'd like to see the program itself or any one of them 
 
 Mr. Rogers We made a hundred programs for EEN the Eastern Educational Network and 
 then when the money ran out people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the 
 fore and said we 've got to have more of this neighborhood expression of care And this is what 
 This is what I give I give an expression of care every day to each child to help him realize 
 that he is unique I end the  've made this day a special day by just 
 your being you There 's no person in the whole world like you and I like you just the way 
 you are And I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are 
 mentionable and manageable we will have done a great service for mental health I think that 
 it 's much more dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger much 
 more dramatic than showing something of gunfire I 'm constantly concerned about what our 
 children are seeing and for 15 years I have tried in this country and Canada to present what 
 I feel is a meaningful expression of care 
 
 Senator Pastore Do you narrate it 
 
 Mr. Rogers I 'm the host yes And I do all the puppets and I write all the music and I write 
 all the scripts 
 
  
  
 
                                  
 Senator Pastore Well I 'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy and this is the first time I 've 
 had goose bumps for the last two days 
 
 Mr. Rogers Well I 'm grateful not only for your goose bumps but for your interest in in 
 our kind of communication Could I tell you the words of one of the songs which I feel is very 
 important 
 
 Senator Pastore Yes 
 
 Mr. Rogers This has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that children need to 
 know is there And it starts out What do you do with the mad that you feel And that first 
 line came straight from a child I work with children doing puppets in in very personal 
 communication with small groups 
 What do you do with the mad that you feel When you feel so mad you could bite 
 When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong and nothing you do seems very right 
 What do you do Do you punch a bag Do you pound some clay or some dough Do 
 you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go It 's great to be able to 
 stop when you 've planned a thing that 's wrong And be able to do something else 
 instead and think this song 
 I can stop when I want to Can stop when I wish Can stop stop stop 
 anytime And what a good feeling to feel like this And know that the feeling is 
 really mine Know that there 's something deep inside that helps us become 
 what we can For a girl can be someday a lady and a boy can be someday a 
 man 
 Senator Pastore I think it 's wonderful I think it 's wonderful Looks like you just earned the

109,Henry A. Wallace,The Century of the Common Man,1942," Madam Chairman and you who have spoken so eloquently tonight and you who 
 represent 33 different nations on this particular occasion and I wish especially to 
 recognize those who are representing the 14 nations from Latin America 
 I want to say to all all who in a formal or an informal way represent most if not 
 all of the free people free peoples of the world who are met here tonight that 
 we are meeting in the interests of the millions of all the nations who have freedom 
 in their souls To my mind this meeting has just one purpose to let those millions 
 in the other countries know that here in the United States are 130 million men 
 women and children who are in this war to the finish Our American people are 
 utterly resolved to go on until they can strike the relentless blows that will assure 
 a complete victory and with it a new day for the lovers of freedom everywhere on 
 this earth 
 This is a fight between a slave world and a free world Just as in the United States 
 in 1862 we could not remain half slave and half free,""1 so in 1942 the world 
 must make its decision for a complete victory one way or the other 
 As we begin the final stages of this fight to the death between the free world and 
 the slave world it is worthwhile to refresh our minds about the march of freedom 
 for the common man The idea of freedom the freedom that we in the United 
 States know and love so well is derived from the Bible with its extraordinary 
 emphasis on the dignity of the individual Democracy is the only true political 
 expression of Christianity 
 The prophets of the Old Testament were the first to preach social justice But that 
 which was   many centuries before Christ was not given 
 complete and powerful political expression until our nation here in the United 
 States was formed as a Federal Union a century and a half ago Even then the 
 march of the common people had just begun Most of them did not yet know how 
 to read and write There were no public schools Men and women can not be really 
 free until they have plenty to eat and time and ability to read and think and talk 
 things over Down the years the people of the United States have moved steadily 
 forward in the practice of democracy Through universal education they can now 
 read and write and form opinions of their own They have learned and are still 
 learning the art of production how to make a living They have learned and are 
 still learning the art of self government 
 If we were to measure   nutrition education and 
 self government we might rank the United States and certain nations of Western 
 Europe very high But this would not be fair to other nations where education has 
 become widespread only in the last 20 years In many nations a generation ago 9 
 out of 10 of the people could not read or write Russia for example was changed 
 from an illiterate to a literate nation within one generation and in the process 
 Russia 's appreciation of freedom was tremendously increased In China the 
 growth in education in reading and the ability of the people to read and write 
 during the past 30 years has been   interest in real liberty 
 Everywhere reading and writing are and 
 industrial progress sooner or later inevitably brings a strong labor labor 
 movement From a long time and fundamental point of view there are no 
 backward peoples which are lacking in mechanical sense Russians Chinese and 
 the Indians both of India and the Americas all learn to read and write and operate 
 machines just as well as your children or my children Everywhere the common 
 people are on the march By the millions they are learning to read and write 
 learning to think together learning to use tools They 're learning to think and 
 work together in labor movements some of which may be extreme or a little 
 impractical at first but which eventually will settle down to serve effectively the 
 interests of the common man 
 When the freedom loving people march when the farmers have an opportunity to 
 buy land at reasonable prices and sell the produce of their land through their own 
 organizations when workers have the opportunity to form unions and bargain 
 through them collectively and when the children of all the people have an 
 opportunity to attend schools which teach them that truth of the real world 
 when these opportunities are open to everyone then the world moves straight 
 ahead 
 But in countries where the ability to read and write has been recently acquired 
 mind you 62 of the world today do not yet know how to read and write But in 
 those countries where the ability has been recently acquired or where the people 
 have had no long experience in governing themselves on the basis of their own 
 thinking it is easy for demagogues to arise and prostitute the mind of the common 
 man to their own base ends Such a demagogue may get financial help from some 
 person of wealth who is unaware of what the end result will be With this backing 
 the demagogue may dominate the minds of the people and from whatever degree 
 of freedom they have lead them back into a most degraded slavery Herr Thyssen 
 the wealthy German steel man little realized what he was doing when he gave 
 Hitler enough money to enable him to play on the minds of the German people 
 The demagogue is the curse of the modern world and of all the demagogues the 
 worst are those  wealthy men who sincerely believe that 
 their wealth is likely to be safer if they can hire men with political it to change 
 the the sign posts and lure the people back into slavery Unfortunately for the 
 wealthy men who finance movements of this sort as well as for the people 
 themselves the successful demagogue is a powerful genie who when once let out 
 of his bottle refuses to obey anyone 's command As long as his spell holds he 
 defies God Himself and Satan is turned loose on the world 
 Through the Through the leaders of the Nazi revolution Satan is now trying to 
 lead the common man of the whole world back into slavery and darkness For the 
 stark truth is that the violence   is the devil 's own religion of 
 darkness So also is the doctrine that one race or one class 
 and that all other races or classes are supposed to be slaves The belief in one 
 Satan inspired Fuhrer with his Quislings his Lavals his Mussolinis his 
 gauleiters in every nation in the world is the last and ultimate darkness Is 
 there any hell hotter than that of being a Quisling unless it is that of being a Laval 
 or a Mussolini 
 In a twisted sense there is something almost great in the figure of the Supreme 
 Devil operating through a human form in a Hitler who has the daring to spit 
 straight into the eye of God and man But the Nazi system has a heroic position for 
 only one leader By definition only one person is allowed to retain full sovereignty 
 over his own soul All the rest are stooges They are stooges who have been 
 mentally and politically degraded and who feel that they can get square with the 
 world   politically degrading other people These stooges are 
 really psychopathic cases Satan has turned loose upon us the insane 
 The search of the freedom The march of freedom of the past 150 years has been 
 a long drawn out people 's revolution In this Great Revolution of the people there 
 were the American Revolution of 1775 the French Revolution of 1792 the 
 Latin American revolutions of the Bolivarian era the German Revolution of 1848 
 and the Russian Revolution of 191[7 Each spoke for the common man in terms of 
 blood on the battlefield Some went to excess But the significant thing is that the 
 people groped their way to the light More of them learned to think and work 
 together 
 The people 's revolution aims at peace and not at violence but if the rights of the 
 common man are attacked it unleashes the ferocity of the she bear who has lost a 
 cub When the Nazi psychologists tell their master Hitler that we in the United 
 States may be able to produce hundreds of thousands of planes but that we have 
 no will to fight they are only fooling themselves and him The truth is that when 
 the rights of the American people are transgressed as these rights have been 
 transgressed the American people will fight with a relentless fury which will drive 
 the ancient Teutonic gods back cowering into their caves The Götterdämmerung 
 has come for Odin and his crew.2 
 The people are on the march toward an even fuller freedom than the most 
 fortunate peoples of the world have hitherto enjoyed No Nazi counter revolution 
 will stop it The common man will smoke the Hitler stooges out into the open in 
 the United States in Latin America in India He will He will destroy their 
 influence No Lavals no Mussolinis will be tolerated in a Free World 
 The people in their millennial and revolutionary march toward manifesting here 
 on earth the dignity that is in every human soul hold as their credo the Four 
 Freedoms   in his message to Congress on 
 January 6th 1941 These four freedoms are the very core of the revolution for 
 which the United Nations have taken their stand We who live in the United States 
 may think there is nothing very revolutionary about freedom of religion freedom 
 of expression and freedom from fear freedom from the secret police But when 
 we begin to think about the significance of freedom from want for the average 
 man then we know that the revolution of the past 150 years has not been 
 completed either here in the United States or any place else in the world We 
 know that this revolution can not stop until freedom from want has actually been 
 attained 
 And now as we move forward toward realizing the Four Freedoms of this people 's 
 revolution I would like to speak about four duties 
 It is my belief that every freedom every right every privilege has its price its 
 corresponding duty without which it can not be enjoyed The four duties of the 
 people 's revolution as I see them as of this day are these 
 1 The duty to produce to the limit 
 2 The duty to transport as rapidly as possible to the line of battle 
 3 The duty to fight with all that is in us 
 And 
 4 The duty to build a peace just charitable and enduring 
 The fourth duty is that which inspires the other three 
 We failed in our job after World War Number One We did not know how to how 
 to go about it to build an enduring world wide peace We did not have the nerve 
 to follow through and prevent Germany from rearming We did not We did not 
 insist that she learn war no more We did not build a peace treaty on the 
 fundamental doctrine of the people 's revolution We did not strive whole heartedly 
 to create a world where there could be freedom from want for all the peoples But 
 by our very errors we learned much and after this war we shall be in position to 
 utilize our knowledge in building a world which is economically politically and I 
 hope spiritually sound 
 Modern science which is  essential part of the people 's 
 revolution has made it technologically possible to see that all the people of the 
 world get enough to eat Half in fun half seriously I said the other day to Madame 
 Litvinov The object of this war is to make it sure that everyone can have a quart 
 of milk to drink every day And she said Yes even half a pint The peace must 
 mean a better standard of living for the common man not merely in the United 
 States and England but also in India Russia China and Latin America not 
 merely in the United Nations but also in Germany Italy and Japan 
 Some have spoken of the American Century I say that the century on which we 
 are entering the century which will come into being after this war can be and 
 must be the century of the common man 
 Perhaps it will be America 's opportunity to to support the Freedom[s and 
  common man must live Everywhere the common man must 
 learn to build his own industries with his own hands in practical fashion 
 Everywhere the common man must learn to increase his productivity so that he 
 and his children can eventually pay to the world community all that they have 
 received No nation will have the God given right to exploit other nations Older 
 nations will have the privilege to help younger nations get started on the path to 
 industrialization but there must be neither military nor economic imperialism 
 The methods of the 19th century will not work in the people 's century which is 
 now about to begin India China and Latin America have a tremendous stake in 
 the people 's century As their masses learn to read and write and as they become 
 productive mechanics their standard of living will double and treble Modern 
 science when devoted whole heartedly to the general welfare has in it 
 potentialities of which we do not yet dream 
 And modern science must be released from German slavery International cartels 
 that serve American greed and German will to power must go Cartels in the peace 
 to come must be subjected to international control for the common man as well 
 as being under adequate   home governments In this 
 way we can prevent the Germans from again building a war machine while we 
 sleep With international monopoly pools under control it will be possible for 
 inventions to serve all the people instead of only the few 
 Yes and when the time of peace comes the citizen will again have a duty the 
 consumer will have a duty the supreme duty of sacrificing the lesser interest for 
 the greater interest of the general welfare Those who write the peace must think 
 of the whole world There can be no privileged peoples We ourselves in the United 
 States are no more a master race than the Nazis And we can not perpetuate 
 economic warfare without planting the seeds of military warfare We must use our 
 power at the peace table to build an economic peace that is charitable and 
 enduring 
 If we really believe that we are fighting for a people 's peace all the rest becomes 
 easy Production Yes It will be easy to get production without either strikes or 
 sabotage production with the whole hearted cooperation between willing arms 
 and keen brains enthusiasm zip energy geared to the tempo of keeping 
 everlastingly at it day after day Hitler knows as well as those of us who sit in on 
 the War Production Board meetings that we here in the United States are winning 
 the battle of production He knows that both labor and business in the United 
 States are doing a most remarkable job and that his only hope is to crash through 
 to a complete victory some time during the next six months 
 Then there is the task of transportation to the line of  railroad 
 car and ship We shall joyously deny ourselves so that our transportation system 
 is   30 percent And there will have to be some denying and 
 you 're going to hear plenty about it 
 I need say little about the duty to fight Some people declare and Hitler believes 
 that the American people have grown soft in the last generation Hitler agents 
 continually preach in South America that we are cowards unable to use like the 
 brave German soldiers the weapons of modern war It is true that American 
 youth hates war with a holy hatred But because of that fact and because Hitler 
 and the German people stand as the very symbol of war we shall fight with a 
 tireless enthusiasm until war and the possibility of war have been removed from 
 this planet We shall cleanse the plague spot of Europe which is Hitler 's Germany 
 not the real Germany and with it the hellhole of Asia which is Japan 
 The American people have always had guts and always will have You know the 
 story of Bomber Pilot Dixon and Radioman Gene Aldrich and Ordnanceman Tony 
 Pastula the story which Americans will be telling their children for generations 
 to come as an illustration man 's ability to master any fate These men lived for 34 
 days on the open sea in a rubber life raft 8 feet by 4 feet with no food but that 
 which they took from the sea and the air with one pocket knife and a pistol And 
 yet they lived it through and came at last to the beach of an island they did not 
 know In spite of their suffering they stood like men with no weapon left to 
 protect themselves no shoes on their feet or clothes on their backs and walked in 
 military file because they said If there were Japs we did n't want to be 
 crawling 
 The American fighting men and all the fighting men of the United Nations will 
 need to summon all their courage during the next few months I am convinced 
 that the summer and fall of 1942 will be a time of supreme crisis for all of us 
 Hitler like the prize fighter who realizes that he is on the verge of being knocked 
 out is gathering all his remaining forces for one last desperate blow There is 
 abject fear in the heart of the madman and a growing discontent among his people 
 as he prepares for his last all out offensive 
 We may be sure that Hitler and Japan will cooperate to do the unexpected 
 perhaps an   Alaska and our northwest coast at the time 
 when German transport planes will be shuttled across from Dakar to furnish 
 leadership and stiffening to a German uprising in Latin America In any event the 
 psychological and sabotage offensive in the United States and Latin America will 
 be timed to coincide with or   weeks the height of the military 
 offensive 
 We must be especially prepared to stifle the fifth columnists in the United States 
 who will try to sabotage not merely our war material plants but even more 
 important infinitely more important our minds We must be prepared for the 
 worst kind of fifth column work in Latin America much of it operating through the 
 agency of governments with which the United States at present is at peace When 
 I say this I recognize that the peoples the peoples both of Latin America and of 
 the nations supporting the agencies through which the fifth columnists work are 
 overwhelmingly on the side of the democracies We must expect the offensive 
 against us on the military propaganda and sabotage fronts both in the United 
 States and Latin America to reach its apex some time during the next few months 
 The convulsive efforts of the dying madman will be so great that some of us may 
 be deceived into thinking that the situation is bad at the very time when it is really 
 getting better 
 But in the case of most of us the events of the next few months disturbing 
 though they may be will only increase our will to bring about complete victory in 
 this war of liberation Prepared in spirit we can not be surprised Psychological 
 terrorism will fall flat As we nerve ourselves for the supreme effort in this 
 hemisphere we must not forget the sublime heroism of the oppressed in Europe 
 and Asia whether it be in the mountains of Yugoslavia the factories of 
 Czechoslovakia and France the farms of Poland Denmark Holland and Belgium 
 among the seamen of Norway or in the occupied areas of China and the Dutch 
 East Indies Everywhere the soul of man is letting the tyrant know that slavery of 
 the body does not end resistance 
 There can be no half measures North South East West and Middle West the 
 will of the American people is for complete victory 
 No compromise with Satan is possible We shall not rest until the victims under 
 the Nazi and Japanese yoke are freed We shall fight for a complete peace as well 
 as a complete victory 
 The people 's revolution is on the march and the devil and all his angels can not 
 prevail against it They can not prevail for on the side of the people is the Lord 
 He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might He 
 increaseth strength they that wait upon the Lord shall mount up 
 with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall 
 walk and not be faint.3 
 Strong in the strength of the Lord we who fight in the people 's cause will never 
 stop until that cause is won",0.0099206650629639,0.0112747456878423,0.0047743059694767,0.07477967441082,0.8711917996406555,0.0101210372522473,0.0179378408938646,0.0606166340781725,0.4573339398018884,63.47359389760061,0.2640424590888987,0.017389288198469743,0.1017897091722595,0.039586028460543335,26.788819875776397,0.0
110,Mark Twain,Address on the 4th of July,1899," I thank you for the compliment which has just been tendered me and to show my 
 appreciation of it I will not afflict you with many words 
 It is pleasant to celebrate in this peaceful way upon this old mother soil the 
 anniversary of an experiment which was born of war with this same land so long 
 ago and wrought out to a successful   It has 
 taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English and Americans into kindly and 
 mutually appreciative relations but I believe it has been accomplished at last 
 It was a great step when the two last misunderstandings were settled by 
 arbitration instead of cannon It is another great step when England adopts our 
 sewing machines without claiming the invention as usual It was another when 
 they imported one of our sleeping cars the other day And it warmed my heart 
 more than I can tell yesterday when I witnessed the spectacle of an Englishman 
 ordering an American sherry cobbler of his own free will and accord and not 
 only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the barkeeper not to 
 forget the strawberries 
 With a common origin a common language a common literature a common 
 religion and common drinks what is longer needful to the cementing of the two 
 nations together in a permanent bond of brotherhood 
 This is an age of progress and ours is a progressive land A great and glorious 
 land too a land which has developed a Washington a Franklin a William M. 
 Tweed a Longfellow a Motley a Jay Gould a Samuel C. Pomeroy a recent 
 Congress which has never had its equal in some respects and a United States 
 Army which conquered sixty Indians in eight   out which is 
 much better than uncivilized slaughter God knows 
 We have a criminal jury system which is superior to any in the world and its 
 efficiency is only   of finding twelve men every day who 
 do n't know anything and ca n't read And I may observe that we have an insanity 
 plea that would have saved Cain 
 I think I can say and say with pride that we have some legislatures that bring 
 higher prices than any in the world 
 I refer with effusion to our railway system which consents to let us live though it 
 might do the opposite being our owners It only destroyed three thousand and 
 seventy lives last  twenty seven thousand two hundred and 
  heedless and unnecessary people at crossings The 
 companies seriously regretted the killing of these thirty thousand people and 
 went so far as to pay for some of them voluntarily of course for the meanest of 
 us would not claim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law 
 against a railway company But thank Heaven the railway companies are 
 generally disposed to do the right and kindly thing without compulsion I know of 
 an instance which greatly touched me at the time After an accident the company 
 sent home the remains of a dear distant old relative of mine in a basket with the 
 remark Please state what figure you hold him at and return the basket Now 
 there could n't be anything friendlier than that 
 But I must not stand here and brag all night However you wo n't mind a body 
 bragging a little about his country on the Fourth of July It is a fair and legitimate 
 time to fly the eagle 
 I will say only one more word of brag and a hopeful one It is this We have a 
 form of government which gives each man a fair chance and no favor With us no 
 individual is born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in 
 contempt Let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that And we may 
 find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is the condition of our 
 political morality today England has risen up out of a far fouler since the days 
 when Charles I ennobled courtesans and all political place was a matter of bargain 
 and sale 
 There is hope for us yet 
 At least the above is the speech which I was going to make but our minister 
 General Schenck presided and after the blessing got up and made a great long 
 inconceivably dull harangue and wound   inasmuch as 
 speech making did not seem to exhilarate the guests much all further oratory 
 would be dispensed with during the evening and we could just sit and talk 
 privately to our elbow neighbors and have a good sociable time It is known that 
 in consequence of that remark forty four perfected speeches died in the womb 
 The depression the gloom the solemnity that reigned over the banquet from that 
 time forth will be a lasting memory with many that were there By that one 
 thoughtless remark General Schenck lost forty four of the best friends he had in 
 England More than one said that night And this is the sort of person that is sent 
 to represent us in a great sister empire",0.0031883213669061,0.0048812171444296,0.0006833694642409,0.961711883544922,0.0231151841580867,0.0034289434552192,0.0029910616576671,0.2006968031968032,0.5213553113553112,56.080560875513015,0.5018518518518519,0.01633045148895293,0.1686746987951807,0.11789924973204716,30.61764705882353,0.0
111,Martin Luther King Jr.,I 've Been to the Mountaintop,1968," Thank you very kindly my friends As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his 
 eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself I wondered 
 who he was talking about It 's always good to have your closest friend and 
 associate to say something good about you And Ralph Abernathy is the best 
 friend that I have in the world I 'm delighted to see each of you here tonight in 
 spite of a storm warning You reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow 
 Something is happening in Memphis something is happening in our world And 
 you know if I were standing at the beginning of time with the possibility of 
 taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to 
 now and the Almighty said to me Martin Luther King which age would you like 
 to live in I would take my mental   I would watch God 's 
 children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt through or 
 rather across the Red Sea through the wilderness on toward the promised land 
 And in spite of its magnificence I would n't stop there 
 I would move   take my mind to Mount Olympus And I would see 
 Plato Aristotle Socrates Euripides and Aristophanes assembled around the 
 Parthenon And I would watch them around the Parthenon as they discussed the 
 great and eternal issues of reality But I would n't stop there 
 I would go on even to the great heyday of the Roman Empire And I would see 
 developments around there through various emperors and leaders But I would n't 
 stop there 
 I would even come up to the day of the Renaissance and get a quick picture of all 
 that the Renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man But I would n't 
 stop there 
 I would even   that the man for whom I am named had his habitat 
 And I would watch Martin Luther as he tacked his ninety five these s on the door at 
 the church of Wittenberg But I would n't stop there 
 I would come on up even to 1863 and watch a vacillating 
 of Abraham Lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the 
 Emancipation Proclamation But I would n't stop there 
 I would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling with the 
 problems of the bankruptcy of his nation And come with an eloquent cry that we 
 have nothing to fear but fear itself But I would n't stop there 
 Strangely enough I would turn to the Almighty and say If you allow me to live 
 just a few years in the second half of the 20th century I will be happy 
 Now that 's a strange statement to make because the world is all messed up The 
 nation is sick Trouble is in the land confusion all around That 's a strange 
 statement But I know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the 
 stars And I see God working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that 
 men in some strange way are responding 
 Something is happening in our world The masses of people are rising up And 
 wherever they are assembled today whether they are in Johannesburg South 
 Africa Nairobi Kenya Accra Ghana New York City Atlanta Georgia Jackson 
 Mississippi or Memphis Tennessee the cry is always the same We want to be 
 free 
 And another reason that I 'm happy to live in this period is that we have been 
 forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems that 
 men have been trying to grapple with through history but the demands did n't 
 force them to do it Survival demands that we grapple with them Men for years 
 now have been talking about war and peace But now no longer can they just talk 
 about it It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world 
 it 's nonviolence or nonexistence That is where we are today 
 And also in the human rights revolution if something is n't done and done in a 
 hurry to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty 
 their long years of hurt and neglect the whole world is doomed Now I 'm just 
 happy that God has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding And 
 I 'm happy that He 's allowed me to be in Memphis 
 I can remember I can remember when Negroes were just going around as Ralph 
 has said so often scratching where they did n't itch and laughing when they were 
 not tickled But that day is all over We mean business now and we are 
 determined to gain our rightful place in God 's world 
 And that 's all this whole thing is about We are n't engaged in any negative protest 
 and in any negative arguments with anybody We are saying that we are 
 determined to be men We are determined to be people We are saying We are 
 saying that we are God 's children And that we are God 's children we do n't have 
 to live like we are forced to live 
 Now what does all of this mean in this great period of history It means that 
 we 've got to stay together We 've got to stay together and maintain unity You 
 know whenever Pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in Egypt he had 
 a favorite favorite formula for doing it What was that He kept the slaves fighting 
 among themselves But whenever the slaves get together something happens in 
 Pharaoh 's court and he can not hold the slaves in slavery When the slaves get 
 together that 's the beginning of getting out of slavery Now let us maintain unity 
 Secondly let us keep the issues where they are The issue is injustice The issue is 
 the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public 
 servants who happen to be sanitation workers Now we 've got to keep attention 
 on that That 's always the problem with a little violence You know what happened 
 the other day and the press dealt only with the window breaking I read the 
 articles They very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand 
 three hundred sanitation workers are on strike and that Memphis is not being fair 
 to them and that Mayor Loeb is in dire need of a doctor They did n't get around to 
 that 
 Now we 're going to march again and we 've got to march again in order to put the 
 issue where it is supposed to be and force everybody to see that there are 
 thirteen hundred of God 's children here suffering sometimes going hungry going 
 through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out 
 That 's the issue And we 've got to say to the nation We know how it 's coming out 
 For when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to 
 sacrifice for it there is no stopping point short of victory 
 We are n't going to let any mace stop us We are masters in our nonviolent 
 movement in disarming police forces they do n't know what to do I 've seen them 
 so often I remember in Birmingham Alabama when we were in that majestic 
 struggle there we would move out of the 16th Street Baptist Church day after day 
 by the hundreds we would move out And Bull Connor would tell them to send the 
 dogs forth and they did come but we just went before the dogs singing Ai n't 
 gon na let nobody turn me around 
 Bull Connor next would say Turn the fire hoses on And as I said to you the 
 other night Bull Connor did n't know history He knew a kind of physics that 
 somehow did n't relate to the transphysics that we knew about And that was the 
 fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out And we went 
 before the fire hoses we had known water If we were Baptist or some other 
 denominations we had been immersed If we were Methodist and some others 
 we had been sprinkled but we knew water That could n't stop us 
 And we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them and we 'd go on 
 before the water hoses and we would look at it and we 'd just go on singing Over 
 my head I see freedom in the air And then we would be thrown in the paddy 
 wagons and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can And they 
 would throw us in and old Bull would say Take 'em off and they did and we 
 would just go in the paddy wagon singing We Shall Overcome And every now 
 and then we 'd get in jail and we 'd see the jailers looking through the windows 
 being and being   And 
 there was a power there which Bull Connor could n't adjust to and so we ended up 
 transforming Bull into a steer and we won our struggle in Birmingham Now we 've 
 got to go on in Memphis just like that I call upon you to be with us when we go 
 out Monday 
 Now about injunctions We have an injunction and we 're going into court 
 tomorrow morning to fight this illegal unconstitutional injunction All we say to 
 America is Be true to what you said on paper If I lived in China or even Russia 
 or any totalitarian country maybe I could understand some of these illegal 
 injunctions Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment 
 privileges because they had n't committed themselves to that over there But 
 somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly Somewhere I read of the freedom 
 of speech Somewhere I read of the freedom of press Somewhere I read that the 
 greatness of America is the right to protest for right.1 And so just as I say we 
 are n't going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around we are n't going to let any 
 injunction turn us around We are going on 
 We need all of you And you know what 's beautiful to me is to see all of these 
 ministers of the Gospel It 's a marvelous picture Who is it that is supposed to 
 articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher 
 Somehow the preacher must have a kind of fire shut up in his bones And 
 whenever injustice is around he tell it Somehow the preacher must be an Amos 
 and saith When God speaks who can but prophesy Again with Amos Let 
 justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream Somehow 
 the preacher must say with Jesus The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he 
 hath anointed me and he 's anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor 
 And I want to commend the preachers under the leadership of these noble men 
 James Lawson one who has been in this struggle for many years he 's been to jail 
 for struggling he 's been kicked out of Vanderbilt University for this struggle but 
 he 's still going on fighting for the rights of his people Reverend Ralph Jackson 
 Billy Kiles I could just go right on down the list but time will not permit But I 
 want to thank all of them And I want you to thank them because so often 
 preachers are n't concerned about anything but themselves And I 'm always happy 
 to see a relevant ministry 
 It 's all right to talk about long white robes over yonder in all of its symbolism 
 But ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here 
 It 's all right to talk about streets flowing with milk and honey but God has 
 commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here and his children who 
 ca n't eat three square meals a day It 's all right to talk about the new Jerusalem 
 but one day God 's preacher must talk about the new New York the new Atlanta 
 the new Philadelphia the new Los Angeles the new Memphis Tennessee This is 
 what we have to do 
 Now the other thing we 'll have to do is this Always anchor our external direct 
 action with the power of economic withdrawal Now we are poor people 
 Individually we are poor when you compare us with white society in America We 
 are poor Never stop and forget that collectively that means all of us together 
 collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world with the exception of 
 nine Did you ever think about that After you leave the United States Soviet 
 Russia Great Britain West Germany France and I could name the others the 
 American Negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world We have an 
 annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year which is more than all of 
 the exports of the United States and more than the national budget of Canada Did 
 you know that That 's power right there if we know how to pool it 
 We do n't have to argue with anybody We do n't have to curse and go around 
 acting bad with our words We do n't need any bricks and bottles We do n't need 
 any Molotov cocktails We just need to go around to these stores and to these 
 massive industries in our country and say 
 God sent  say to you that you 're not treating his children 
 right And we 've   ask you to make the first item on your 
 agenda fair treatment where God 's children are concerned Now if you 
 are not prepared to do that we do have an agenda that we must follow 
 And our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you 
 And so as a result of this we are asking you tonight to go out and tell your 
 neighbors not to buy Coca Cola in Memphis   them not to buy 
 Sealtest milk Tell them not to buy what is the other bread Wonder Bread 
 And what is the other bread company Jesse Tell them not to buy Hart 's bread As 
 Jesse Jackson has said up to now only the garbage men have been feeling pain 
 now we must kind of redistribute the pain We are choosing these companies 
 because they have n't been fair in their hiring policies and we are choosing them 
 because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs 
 and the rights of these men who are on strike And then they can move on town 
 downtown and tell Mayor Loeb to do what is right 
 But not only that we 've got to strengthen black institutions I call upon you to 
 take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in Tri State 
 Bank We want a bank in movement in Memphis   and loan 
 association I 'm not asking you something that we do n't do ourselves at SCLC 
 Judge Hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings 
 and loan association from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference We are 
 telling you to follow what we are doing Put your money there You have six or 
 seven black insurance companies here in the city of Memphis Take out your 
 insurance there We want to have an insurance in 
 Now these are some practical things that we can do We begin the process of 
 building a greater economic base And at the same time we are putting pressure 
 where it really hurts I ask you to follow through here 
 Now let me say as I move to my conclusion that we 've got to give ourselves to 
 this struggle until the end Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point 
 in Memphis We 've got to see it through And when we have our march you need 
 to be there If it means leaving work if it means leaving school be there Be 
 concerned about your brother You may not be on strike But either we go up 
 together or we go down together 
 Let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness One day a man came to Jesus 
 and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters of life At points 
 he wanted to trick Jesus and show him that he knew a little more than Jesus 
 knew and throw him off base 
 Now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological 
 debate But Jesus immediately pulled that question from mid air and placed it on 
 a dangerous curve between Jerusalem and Jericho And he talked about a certain 
 man who fell among thieves You remember that a Levite and a priest passed by 
 on the other side They did n't stop to help him And finally a man of another race 
  down from his beast decided not to be compassionate by proxy 
 But he got down with him administered first aid and helped the man in need 
 Jesus ended up saying this was the good man this was the great man because he 
 had the capacity to project the I into the thou and to be concerned about his 
 brother 
 Now you know we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the 
 priest and the Levite did n't stop At times we say they were busy going to a church 
 meeting an ecclesiastical gathering and they had to get on down to Jerusalem so 
 they would n't be late for their meeting At other times we would speculate that 
 there was a religious law that One who was engaged in religious ceremonials was 
 not to touch a human body twenty four hours before the ceremony And every 
 now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to 
 Jerusalem or down to Jericho rather to organize a Jericho Road Improvement 
 Association That 's a possibility Maybe they felt that it was better to deal with 
 the problem from the causal root rather than to get bogged down with an 
 individual effect 
 But I 'm going to tell you what my imagination tells me It 's possible that those 
 men were afraid You see the Jericho road is a dangerous road I remember when 
 Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem 
 down to Jericho And as soon as we got on that road I said to my wife I can see 
 why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable It 's a winding meandering 
 road It 's really conducive for ambushing You start out in Jerusalem which is 
 about 1200 miles or rather 1200 feet above sea level   you get 
 down to Jericho fifteen or twenty minutes later you 're about 2200 feet below sea 
 level That 's a dangerous road In the days of Jesus it came to be known as the 
 Bloody Pass And you know it 's possible that the priest and the Levite looked 
 over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around Or it 's 
 possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking And he was 
 acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there lure 
 them there for quick and easy seizure And so the first question that the priest 
 asked the first question that the Levite asked was If I stop to help this man 
 what will happen to me But then the Good Samaritan  reversed 
 the question If I do not stop to help this man what will happen to him 
 That 's the question before you tonight Not If I stop to help the sanitation 
 workers what will happen to my job Not If I stop to help the sanitation workers 
 what will happen to all of the hours that I usually spend in my office every day and 
 every week as a pastor The question is not If I stop to help this man in need 
 what will happen to me The question is If I do not stop to help the sanitation 
 workers what will happen to them That 's the question 
 Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness Let us stand with a greater 
 determination And let us move on in these powerful days these days of challenge 
 to make America what it ought to be We have an opportunity to make America a 
 better nation And I want to thank God once more for allowing me to be here 
 with you 
 You know several years ago I was in New York City autographing the first book 
 that I had written And while sitting there autographing books a demented black 
 woman came up The only question I heard from her was Are you Martin Luther 
 King And I was looking down writing and I said Yes And the next minute I 
 felt something beating on my chest Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this 
 demented woman I was rushed to Harlem Hospital It was a dark Saturday 
 afternoon And that blade had gone through and the X rays revealed that the tip 
 of the blade was on the edge of my aorta the main artery And once that 's 
 punctured your drowned in your own blood that 's the end of you 
 It came out in the New York Times the next morning that if I had merely sneezed 
 I would have died Well about four days later they allowed me after the 
 operation after my chest had been opened and the blade had been taken out to 
 move around in the wheel chair in the hospital They allowed me to read some of 
 the mail that came in and from all over the states and the world kind letters came 
 in I read a few but one of them I will never forget I had received one from the 
 President and the Vice President I 've forgotten what those telegrams said I 'd 
 received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York but I 've forgotten 
 what that letter said But there was another letter that came from a little girl a 
 young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School And I looked at that 
 letter and I 'll never forget it It said simply 
 Dear Dr. King 
 I am a ninth grade student at the White Plains High School 
 And she said 
 While it should not matter I would like to mention that I 'm a white 
 girl I read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering And I 
 read that if you had sneezed you would have died And I 'm simply 
 writing you to say that I 'm so happy that you did n't sneeze 
 And I want to say tonight I want to say tonight that I too am happy that I did n't 
 sneeze Because if I had sneezed I would n't have been around here in 1960 when 
 students all over the South started sitting in at lunch counters And I knew that as 
 they were sitting in they were really standing up for the best in the American 
 dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which 
 were dug   Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and 
 the Constitution 
 If I had sneezed I would n't have been around here in 1961 when we decided to 
 take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in inter state travel 
 If I had sneezed I would n't have been around here in 1962 when Negroes in 
 Albany Georgia decided to straighten their backs up And whenever men and 
 women straighten their backs up they are going somewhere because a man ca n't 
 ride your back unless it is bent 
 If I had sneezed If I had sneezed I would n't have been here in 1963 when the 
 black people of Birmingham Alabama aroused the conscience of this nation and 
 brought into being the Civil Rights Bill 
 If I had sneezed I would n't have had a chance later that year in August to try to 
 tell America about a dream that I had had 
 If I had sneezed I would n't have been down in Selma Alabama to see the great 
 Movement there 
 If I had sneezed I would n't have been in Memphis to see a community rally 
 around those brothers and sisters who are suffering 
 I 'm so happy that I did n't sneeze 
 And they were telling me Now it does n't matter now It really does n't matter 
 what happens now I left Atlanta this morning and as we got started on the plane 
 there were six of us The pilot said over the public address system We are sorry 
 for the delay but we have Dr. Martin Luther King on the plane And to be sure that 
 all of the bags were checked and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on 
 the plane we had to check out everything carefully And we 've had the plane 
 protected and guarded all night 
 And then I got into Memphis And some began to say the threats or talk about the 
 threats that were out What would happen to me from some of our sick white 
 brothers 
 Well I do n't know what will happen now We 've got some difficult days ahead But 
 it really does n't matter with me now because I 've been to the mountaintop 
 And I do n't mind 
 Like anybody I would like to live a long life Longevity has its place But I 'm not 
 concerned about that now I just want to do God 's will And He 's allowed me to go 
 up to the mountain And I 've looked over And I 've seen the Promised Land I may 
 not get there with you But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will 
 get to the promised land 
 And so I 'm happy tonight 
 I 'm not worried about anything 
 I 'm not fearing any man

112,Theresa May,General Election Announcement,2017," I have just chaired a meeting of the Cabinet where we agreed that the 
 Government should call a general election to be held on the 8th of June I want to 
 explain the reasons for that decision what will happen next and the choice facing 
 the British people when you come to vote in this election 
 Last summer after the country voted to leave the European Union Britain needed 
 certainty stability and strong leadership and since I became Prime Minister the 
 Government has delivered precisely that Despite predictions of immediate 
 financial and economic danger since the referendum we have seen consumer 
 confidence remain high record numbers of jobs and economic growth that has 
 exceeded all expectations We have also delivered on the mandate that we were 
  result Britain is leaving the European Union and there 
 can be no turning back 
 And as we look to the future the Government has the right plan for negotiating 
 our new relationship with Europe We want a deep and special partnership 
 between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is 
 free to chart its own way in the world That means we will regain control of our 
 own money our own laws and our own borders and we will be free to strike 
 trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world 
 This is the right approach and it is in the national interest But the other political 
 parties oppose it At this moment of enormous national significance there should 
 be unity here in Westminster but instead there is division The country is coming 
 together but Westminster is not 
 In recent weeks Labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we 
 reach with the European Union The Liberal Democrats have said they want to 
 grind the business of Government to a standstill The Scottish National Party say 
 they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britain ’s membership of 
 the European Union And unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to 
 fight us every step of the way 
 Our opponents believe because the Government ’s majority is so small that our 
 resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course They are wrong 
 They under estimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared 
 to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country 
 because what they are doing jeopardizes the work we must do to prepare for 
 Brexit at home and it weakens the Government ’s negotiating position in Europe 
 If we do not hold a general election now their political game playing will continue 
 and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage 
 in the run up to the next scheduled election Division in Westminster will risk our 
 ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and 
 instability to the country So we need a general election and we need one now 
 because we have at this moment a one off chance to get this done while the 
 European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin 
 I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion 
 Since I became Prime Minister I have said that there should be no election until 
 2020 but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and 
 stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the 
 decisions I must take And so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of 
 Commons calling for a general election to be held on the 8th of June 
 That motion as set -Term Parliament[s Act will require a 
 two thirds majority of the House of Commons So I have a simple challenge to the 
 opposition parties You have criticized the Government ’s vision for Brexit you 
 have challenged our objectives you have threatened to block the legislation we 
 put before Parliament This is your moment to show you mean it to show you are 
 not opposing the Government for the sake of it to show that you do not treat 
 politics as a game 
 Let us tomorrow vote for an election Let us put forward our plans for Brexit and 
 our alternative programs for Government And then let the people decide And the 
 decision facing the country will be all about leadership 
 It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest 
 with me as your Prime Minister or weak and unstable coalition Government led 
 by Jeremy Corbyn propped   Democrats who want to reopen the 
 divisions of the referendum and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP 
 Every vote for the Conservatives will make it harder for opposition politicians who 
 want to stop me from getting the job done 
 Every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for 
 Britain with the Prime Ministers Presidents and Chancellors of the European 
 Union 
 Every vote for the Conservatives will mean we can stick to our plan for a stronger 
 Britain and take the right long term decisions for a more secure future 
 It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election but it is with 
 strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable 
 leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond 
 So tomorrow let the House of Commons vote for an election 
 Let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programs for 
 Government 
 And let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the 
 country the strong and stable leadership it demands

113,Mike Pompeo,Supporting Iranian Voices Address,2018," Well thank you Fred for that kind introduction It reminded me when I was going 
 through my confirmation process they were chasing down all the people I ’d known 
 my whole life and they found one of the young men who played basketball with 
 me at Los Amigos and his quote was they asked how good I was And he said 
 Well he made the most of what he had 
 Thanks for the kind introduction and thanks for hosting me here at the Ronald 
 Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library It ’s a very special place and an honor 
 for me to be here 
 I also want to thank my friend Tom for joining me here tonight He and I have 
 been on multiple missions together and I am confident we will continue to do so 
 in the days and weeks and years ahead 
 And it ’s great to see Governor Wilson here I voted for you a couple times a long 
 time ago 
 And I know we have many members of the Iranian American community with us 
 this evening This is just a fraction of the quarter million Iranian Americans in 
 Southern California alone We have many Iranian American guests from all across 
 the United States here as well Thank you I look forward to hearing from you this 
 evening learning more about the situation in Iran as you see it and 
 understanding what your loved ones and friends are going through living in that 
 place 
 And I recognize the Iranian diaspora is diverse There are many faith backgrounds 
 and many different walks of life and that ’s a good thing and not all Iranian 
 Americans see things the same way But I think everyone can agree that the 
 regime in Iran has been a nightmare for the Iranian people and it is important 
 that your unity on that point is not 
 To our Iranian American and to our Iranian American friends tonight I want to 
 tell you that the Trump Administration dreams the same dreams for the people of 
 Iran as you do and through our labors and God ’s providence that day will come 
 true 
 Next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran As I ’ll 
 spell out more in a moment the 40 years of fruit from the revolution has been 
 bitter Forty years of kleptocracy Forty years of the people ’s wealth squandered 
 on supporting terrorism Forty years of ordinary Iranians thrown in jail for 
 peaceful expression of their rights Why has the regime conducted itself in such an 
 abhorrent way over the past 40 years and subjected its people to these 
 conditions It ’s an important question 
 The answer is at root in the revolutionary nature of the regime itself 
 The ideologues who forcibly came to power in 1979 and remain in power today are 
  to conform all of Iranian society to the tenets of the Islamic 
 Revolution The regime is also committed to spreading the revolution to other 
  necessary The total fulfillment of the revolution at home and 
 abroad is the regime ’s ultimate goal It drives their behavior Thus the regime has 
 spent four decades mobilizing all elements of the Iranian economy foreign policy 
 and political life in service of that objective To the regime prosperity security 
 and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill 
 the revolution 
 Economically we see how the regime ’s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda 
 over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long term economic 
 tailspin During the time of the nuclear deal Iran ’s increased oil revenues could 
 have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people Instead they went to 
 terrorists dictators and proxy militias Today thanks to regime subsidies the 
 average Hizballah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter 
 makes on the streets of Iran Regime mismanagement has led to the rial 
 plummeting in value A third of Iranian youth are unemployed and a third of 
 Iranians now live below the poverty line 
 The bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same 
 time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for 
 opportunity The Iranian economy is going great but only if you ’re a 
 politically connected member of the elite Two years ago Iranians rightfully 
 erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money 
 inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials 
 And there are many more examples of the widespread corruption 
 Take Sadeq Larijani the head of Iran ’s judiciary He is worth at least $ 300 million 
 dollars He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank 
 account The Trump Administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human 
 rights abuses because we are n’t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level 
 Call me crazy you wo n’t be the first but I ’m a little skeptical that a thieving 
 thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran ’s highest ranking 
 judicial official 
 Former IRGC officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed the 
 Billionaire General He went from being a poor IRGC officer at the end of the 
 Iran Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars How ’d that happen He somehow 
 had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from 
 businesses associated with the IRGC Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud 
 Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well 
 The ayatollahs are in on the act too   wealth they seem more 
 concerned with riches than religion These hypocritical holy men have devised all 
 kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on Earth while 
 their people suffer 
 Grand Ayatollah Makaram Shirazi is known as the Sultan of Sugar for his illicit 
 trading of sugar which has generated over $ 100 million for him He has pressured 
 the Iranian Government to lower subsidies to domestic sugar producers while he 
 floods the market with his own more expensive imported sugar This type of 
 activity puts ordinary Iranians out of work 
 Another ayatollah one of Tehran ’s Friday prayer leaders for the last 30 years had 
 the government transfer several lucrative mines to his foundation He too is now 
 worth millions of dollars 
 And not many people know this but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal 
 off the books hedge fund called the Setad worth $ 95 billion with a B. That wealth 
 is untaxed it is ill gotten and it is used as a slush fund for the IRGC The ayatollah 
 fills his   he wants In 2013 the Setad ’s agents 
 banished an 82 year old Baha’i woman from her apartment and confiscated the 
 property after a long campaign of harassment Seizing land from religious 
 minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut 
 that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming All 
 of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei 
 This list goes on but we ’ve got places to go tonight The level of corruption and 
 wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is   resembles 
 the mafia more than a government 
 On foreign policy the regime ’s mission of exporting the revolution has produced a 
 decades long campaign of ideologically motivated violence and destabilization 
 abroad Assad Lebanese Hizballah Hamas Shia militant groups in Iraq and the 
 Houthis in Yemen feed on billions of regime cash while the Iranian people shout 
 slogans like Leave Syria think about us 
 Our partners in the Middle East are   and 
 threatening behavior in the waters of the Persian Gulf The regime and its allies in 
 terror have left a trail of dissident blood across Europe and the Middle East 
 Indeed our European allies are not immune to the threat of regime backed 
 terrorism 
 Just earlier this month an Iranian diplomat based in Vienna was arrested and 
 charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a 
 political rally in France This tells you everything you need to know about the 
 regime At the same time they ’re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear 
 deal they ’re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe 
 And because fighting the United States and destroying Israel is at the core of the 
 regime ’s ideology it has committed and supported many acts of violence and 
 terrorism against both countries and our citizens As just one example well over a 
 thousand American service members have been killed and wounded in Iraq from 
 Iranian made IEDs 
 Today multiple Americans are detained and missing inside of Iran Baquer 
 Namazi Siamak Namazi Xiyue Wang are unjustly   to this day 
 and Bob Levinson has been missing in Iran for over 11 years There are others 
 too And we in the Trump Administration are working diligently to bring each of 
 those Americans home from having been wrongfully detained for far too long 
 Audience Member Shouting President Trump imprisons children The

 Audience Member Shouting off mic 
 Audience USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA 
 Secretary Pompeo Thank you 
 Audience Member Shouting off mic 
 Secretary Pompeo If there were if there were only so much freedom of 
 expression in Iran 
 You know despite the regime ’s clear record of aggression America and other 
 countries have spent years straining to identify a political moderate It ’s like an 
 Iranian unicorn   The regime ’s revolutionary goals and willingness to commit 
 violent acts have n’t produced anyone to lead Iran that can be remotely called a 
 moderate or a statesman 
 Some believe that President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif fit that bill The 
 truth is they are merely polished front men for the ayatollahs international con 
 artistry Their nuclear deal did n’t make them moderates it made them wolves in 
 sheep ’s clothing Governments around the world worry that confronting the 
 Islamic Republic harms the cause of moderates but these so called moderates 
 within the regime are still violent Islamic revolutionaries with an anti America 
 anti West agenda You only have to take their own words for it And for that 
 matter the evidence reveals that their agenda is a anti Iran agenda as well 
 The regime ’s absolute adherence to the Islamic Revolution mean it can not endure 
 any ideas in the Iranian society that would contradict or undermine it unlike we 
 just did here this evening It ’s why the regime has for decades heartlessly 
 repressed its own people ’s human rights dignity and fundamental freedoms 
 It ’s why the Iranian police detained a teenage Iranian gymnast for posting an 
 Instagram video of herself dancing 
 It ’s why the regime arrests hundreds of Ahwazis members of Iran ’s minority Arab 
 community when they speak out to demand respect for their language and for 
 their basic beliefs The government ’s morality police beat women in the streets 
 and arrest those who do not wish to wear the hijab 
 On White Wednesday activist recently one activist was recently sentenced to 
 20 years in prison for protesting compulsory hijab wearing 
 The desire to uphold the Islamic Revolution has especially resulted in gross 
 suppression of the freedom of religion in Iran often to barbaric ends 
 Last month a simple man a bus driver a father of two children and a member of 
 the Iranian Gonabadi Sufi Dervish Community was convicted and sentenced to 
 death His sentence came on questionable grounds following violent clashes 
 between security forces and the Dervishes He was reportedly denied access to a 
 lawyer before during before and during his grossly unfair trial This man Mr. 
 Salas and his supporters maintains his innocence throughout reportedly 
 stating he had been tortured into a forced confession Sadly on June 18th the 
 regime hanged Mr. Salas in prison 
 His death was part of a larger crackdown that began in February when at least 
 300 Sufis demanding the release of their fellow faith members were unjustly 
 arrested Right now hundreds of Sufi Muslims in Iran remain imprisoned on 
 account of their religious beliefs with reports of several having died at the hands 
 of the regime ’s brutal security forces 
 Among those imprisoned is the 91 year old leader Dr. Noor Ali Tabandeh who has 
 been under house arrest for at least the last part of four months the greatest 
 part of four months He is in need of immediate medical care 
 The religious intolerance of the regime in Iran does not only extend to Sufi 
 Muslims The same goes for Christians and Jews and Sunnis and Baha’is and 
 Zoroastrians and members of many other groups inside Iran who live with the fear 
 that their next prayer may be indeed their last 
 What grieves us so badly about the treatment of religious minorities in Iran is that 
 their presence far pre dates the regime They are a historic part of the rich fabric 
 of an ancient and vibrant Iranian civilization That fabric has been torn by 
 intolerant black robed enforcers When other faiths are suppressed the image of 
 Iran becomes a self portrait of the ayatollahs and of the IRGC 
 In response to myriad government failures corruption and disrespect of rights 
 since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and 
 forceful protests since 1979 Some shout the slogan The people are paupers 
 while the mullahs live like gods Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in 
 Tehran The specific grievances do differ but all those voicing dissatisfaction 
 share one thing They have been ill- regime Iranians 
 want to be governed with dignity accountability and respect 
 The regime this is important The regime ’s brutal response to these peaceful 
 protests reflects the intolerance that its revolutionary worldview has produced 
 Last January the regime welcomed in the new year with the arrests of up to 5,000 
 of its own people They were peacefully calling for a better life Hundreds 
 reportedly remain behind bars and several are dead at the hands of their own 
 government The leaders cynically call it suicide 
 Overall it is clear the regime ’s ideology has led many Iranians to be angry they 
 can not call their homeland a normal country 
 They know that a constitution that enshrines the export of Islamic revolution and 
 the destruction of its neighbors and the restriction of citizenship is not normal 
 Ordinary Iranians know that their government ’s torture of its own people is not 
 normal 
 Earning multiple rounds of   Security Council is not normal 
 Inciting chants of Death to America and Death to Israel is not normal 
 Being the number one state sponsor of terror is similarly abnormal 
 Sometimes it seems the world has become desensitized to the regime ’s 
 authoritarianism at home and its campaigns of violence abroad but the proud 
 Iranian people are not staying silent about their government ’s many abuses 
 And the United States under President Trump will not stay silent either 
 In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny I have a message for the 
 people of Iran The United States hears you the United States supports you the 
 United States is with you 
 When the United States sees the shoots of liberty pushing up through rocky soil 
 we pledge our solidarity because we too took a hard first step towards becoming 
 a free country a few years back 
 Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure 
 campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich itself and support 
 death and destruction We have an obligation to put maximum pressure on the 
 regime ’s ability to generate and move money and we will do so 
 At the center of this campaign is the re imposition of sanctions on Iran ’s banking 
 and energy sectors 
 As we have explained over the last few weeks our focus is to work with countries 
 importing Iranian crude oil to get imports as close to zero as possible by 
 November 4th Zero 
 Recently Recently as part of this campaign we designated the Bahraini Shia 
 militia terrorist organization Saraya al Ashtar and with the UAE we have jointly 
 disrupted a currency exchange network that was transferring millions of dollars to 
 the IRGC 
 And there ’s more to come Regime leaders especially those at the top of the 
 IRGC and the Quds Force like Qasem Soleimani must be made to feel painful 
 consequences of their bad decision making We are asking every nation every 
 nation who is sick and tired of the Islamic Republic ’s destructive behavior to join 
 our pressure campaign This especially goes for our allies in the Middle East and 
 Europe people who have themselves been ’s activity 
 for decades 
 And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on 
 the airwaves and online inside of Iran either For 40 years the Iranian people have 
 heard from their leaders that America is the Great Satan We do not believe they 
 are interested in hearing the fake news any longer 
 Today one in four Iranians 14 million people watches or listens to U.S. 
 Government broadcasts each week And it ’s more important than ever now to 
 refute the regime ’s lies and repeat our deep desire for friendship with the Iranian 
 people Right now our U.S. Board Broadcasting Board of Governors is taking 
 new steps to help Iranians get around internet censorship as well The BBG is also 
 launching a new 24/7 Farsi language TV channel.1 It will span not only television 
 but radio digital and social media format so that the ordinary Iranians inside of 
 Iran and around the globe can know that America stands with them 
 And finally and finally America is unafraid to expose human rights violations 
 and support those who are being silenced 
 We continue to raise our concerns over the Islamic Republic ’s dire record of 
 human rights abuses each time we speak at the UN and with our partners who 
 maintain diplomatic relations with that country We make it clear that the world is 
 watching and as the regime continues to make its own people the 
 longest suffering victims we will not stand silent 
 And now we call on everyone here in the audience and our international partners 
 to help us shine a spotlight on the regime ’s abuses and to support the Iranian 
 people 
 The goal of our efforts is to one day see Iranians in Iran enjoying the same quality 
 of life that Iranians in America enjoy 
 Iranians in America enjoy all the freedoms not 
  are free to pursue economic opportunities they believe are 
 best for them and their families and they can be proud of their country and 
 practice their faiths in the way they desire 
 There are a few individuals with us I want to highlight tonight who embody what 
 we hope for the Iranian people 
 Goli Ameri came to the United States as a freshman at Stanford and has founded 
 successful companies and has served at the State Department and at the UN 
 Susan Azizzadeh was forced to leave everything behind and come here in 1979 
 Today she is the leader of the Iranian American Jewish Federation 
 Makan Delrahim I think I saw him came to America with his family when he 
 was just 10 years old He is now the Assistant Attorney General at the Department 
 of Justice quite amazing 
 We hope that the successes of Goli and Susan and Makan and the many others 
 American Iranian Americans among the diaspora in the United States remind all 
 Iranians of what is possible under a government that respects its people and 
 governs with accountability Iranians should not have to flee their homeland to 
 find a better life 
 While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their 
 country the United States in the spirit of our own freedoms will support the 
 long ignored voice of the Iranian people Our hope is that ultimately the regime 
 will make meaningful changes in its behavior both inside of Iran and globally As 
 President Trump has said we ’re willing to talk with the regime in Iran but relief 
 from American pressure will come only when we see tangible demonstrated and 
 sustained shifts in Tehran ’s policies 
 I thought I ’d close tonight in a perfectly appropriate   words of 
 a man who routinely made the case for freedom and respect far more eloquently 
 than I ever could President Ronald Reagan In 1982 In 1982 President Reagan 
 gave a speech to the British Parliament that became known as the Westminster 
 address He urged other Western governments to support those around the world 
 trying to break free of tyranny and injustice His reason why was simple and 
 powerful He said Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few but the 
 inalienable right and universal right of every human being 
 This is why we also call on all governments to end their flirtations with a 
 revolutionary regime and come quickly to the aid of the Iranian people On that 
 same day in those same remarks President Reagan said Let us ask ourselves 
 What kind of people do we think we are And let us answer Free people worthy 
 of freedom and determined not only to remain so but to help others gain their 
 freedom as well 
 Today the United States condemns oppression levied on the Iranian people by 
 those who rule unjustly and we proudly amplify the voices of those in Iran 
 longing to have those inalienable and universal human rights cease to be ignored 
 and instead to be honored We do so knowing that many in the streets and 
 marketplaces speak for those who the regime has permanently silenced over the 
 years who may even have been loved ones who are in the audience tonight 
 It ’s America ’s hope that the next 40 years of Iran ’s history will not be marked by 
 repression and fear but with freedom and fulfillment for the Iranian people 
 Thank you 
 Pete Wilson Well you ’ve answered all the questions 
 Secretary Pompeo We ’ll take another swing Thank you 
 Pete Wilson Well Mr. Secretary I had some questions for you but you actually 
 answered almost all of them quite eloquently 
 Secretary Pompeo We ’ll see if I can give the same answer when I ’m not got 
 remarks in front of me 
 Pete Wilson Well let me just start with this one Is it realistic to think that the 
 Iranian people will ever regain control of their country in what we would term the 
 foreseeable future 
 Secretary Pompeo Of course Well of course Of course I always remind those 
 who think it ’s not possible or think the time horizon will be measured in centuries 
 not hours I always remind them that things change There are disjunctive 
 moments There are times when things happen that are unexpected 
 unanticipated Our revolution would be one of them I could go on You all could 
 name them too 
 We do n’t know the right moment We do n’t know the day that the behavior of the 
 Iranian regime will change But we do know the things that the world is obligated 
 to do so that when the right time comes when the right moment comes that 
 opportunity is even more likely to find its fulfillment 
 Pete Wilson Would you synthesize your excellent speech and really in a few 
 words say what you think the best way to effect that change within the Iranian 
 Government is and how the Trump Administration is helping the Iranian people in 
 their struggle to become freed from this current tyrannical Administration there 
 Secretary Pompeo So President Trump has been absolutely unequivocal on this 
 not only in the message but in the fact that this is a real priority for the 
 Administration as well I think that ’s important One could have a objective but if 
 one does n’t rank it sufficiently high attention spans are short and resources 
 limited The President has put this as something he considers to be incredibly 
 important 
 The mission set for our team is clear It ’s to deny the Iranian leadership the 
 resources the wealth the funds the capacity to continue to foment terrorism 
 around the world and to deny the people inside of Iran the freedoms that they so 
 richly deserve How ’s that in 30 seconds 
 Pete Wilson That ’s pretty good There is a perception among some that Iranians 
 including students and including legitimate visitors ca n’t obtain U.S. visas 
 because of a travel ban Would you clarify what U.S. policy is regarding what we 
 will call Iranian civil society visitors 
 Secretary Pompeo Sure I ’d be happy to do that So President Trump has made 
 clear with respect to a number of countries that were n’t providing us with 
 sufficient information that we had risks of American security that we were going 
 to do our best to work with those countries to develop the information that we 
 needed Iran continues to deny us the basic data sharing systems that hundreds 
 of countries or excuse me dozens and dozens of countries have already 
 provided us We would like Iran to do that 
 We still allow students to come in There are many students I ’m sure there are 
 students here tonight who are Iranians who are here studying We welcome that 
 But this Administration does have as one of its primary policies to make sure that 
 we appropriately vet all those who come to the nation so that we can keep our 
 country safe That ’s the plan That ’s the policy 
 Pete Wilson Well on perhaps an unduly optimistic note what could be a basis for 
 reconciliation between the United States and Iran 
 Secretary Pompeo So it ’s always possible   And the President has made clear the 
 fact that I should n’t have joked The President has made clear he would love 
 that he would welcome that I ’ve now made three trips to Pyongyang a regime 
 that has treated its citizens in way that also denies them their freedoms 
 The President has said if we can get this change if we can get the leadership to 
 make a strategic decision about how to ensure its well being and the well being of 
 its peoples that we ’re prepared to have a conversation and to discuss how that 
 might proceed The President has stated at least once perhaps more than once 
 that he is prepared to do that with the leadership in Iran but not until such time 
 as there are demonstrable tangible irreversible changes in the Iranian regime 
 that I do n’t see happening today But I live in hope 
 Pete Wilson And what would be your advice for students hopefully many in the 
 audience today who will be interested in being part of that effort and seek a 
 career at the State Department How can they best prepare and what challenges 
 should they anticipate 
 Secretary Pompeo So we welcome all hardworking talented patriotic folks to 
 come be part of a great diplomatic team in the United States It ’s an incredible 
 honor I ’m now 12 weeks almost to the day as the Secretary of State The team is 
 fantastic My wisdom for them is no different than the same wisdom I gave my 
 son If he was here he ’d be rolling his eyes about now 
 Work hard study tell the truth every place you go We have lots of folks who 
 speak different languages who have spent time in other countries who have been 
 able to learn about other cultures It ’s critically important that we get that skill set 
 at the State Department Those are the kinds of things that young people who 
 want a wonderful exciting rewarding important career working as an American 
 diplomat ought to think about doing as they move their way through college and 
 beyond and we welcome Go to state.gov It ’s easy to find We ’ve got lots of great 
 places for talented young Americans to come be part of our great team 
 Pete Wilson Well Mr. Secretary you have been quite clear and it ’s I think clear 
 to all of us who are privileged to be in this audience and in this house dedicated to 
 the preservation and the enhancement of the Ronald Reagan legacy that you 
 understand it better than perhaps anybody I ’ve come across in a long time 
 We I think both remember that at a critical time in the history of this country he 
 said with a smile Trust but verify   And it seems to me that ’s your message 
 very clearly and we thank you for the distinguished service that you have given 
 from the moment that you left the Point number one in your class I find that 
 quite impressive And whoever that opponent was against whom you were playing 
 basketball at Los Amigos I think he would have to say when he said Well he 
 made the most of what he could you made the most of a very generous helping 
 from the good Lord of brains and courage and directness We are lucky to have 
 you 
 Secretary Pompeo Thank you Pete That ’s very kind Thank you thank you That ’s 
 very kind 
 Pete Wilson Well it ’s sincere 
 Secretary Pompeo That ’s very very kind Thank you sir",0.0936290696263313,0.1228807270526886,0.0068847881630063,0.1177225112915039,0.587395429611206,0.0605144836008548,0.0109729608520865,0.1109099283652855,0.5045583706967639,49.76324955777472,0.2483323226197695,0.01909867649522533,0.07236595425571804,0.03335832083958021,21.784671532846716,0.0
114,Harry S. Truman,Farewell Address,1953," My fellow Americans 
 I 'm happy to have this opportunity to talk to you once more before I leave 
 the White House 
 Next Tuesday General Eisenhower will be inaugurated as President of the 
 United States A short time after the new President takes his oath of office 
 I will be on the train going back home to Independence Missouri I will 
 once again be a plain private citizen of this great Republic 
 That is as it should be Inauguration Day will be a great demonstration of 
 our democratic process I am glad to be a part of it glad to wish General 
 Eisenhower all possible success as he begins his term glad the whole 
 world will have a chance to see how simply and how peacefully our 
 American system transfers this vast power of the Presidency from my 
 hands to his It is a good object lesson in democracy I am very proud of it 
 And I know you are too 
 During the last 2 months I have done my best to make this transfer an 
 orderly one I have talked with my successor on the affairs of the country 
 both foreign and domestic and my Cabinet officers have talked with their 
 successors I want to say that General Eisenhower and his associates have 
 cooperated fully in this effort Such an orderly transfer from one party to 
 another has never taken place before in our history I think a real 
 precedent has been set 
 In speaking to you tonight I have no new revelations to make no 
 political statements no policy announcements There are simply a few 
 things in my heart that I want to say to you I want to say goodbye and 
 thanks for your help And I want to talk to you a little while about what 
 has happened since I became your President 
 I am speaking to you from the room where I have worked since April the 
 12th 1945 This is the President 's office in the West Wing of the White 
 House This is the desk where I have signed most of the papers that 
 embodied the decisions I have made as President It has been the desk of 
 many Presidents and it will be the desk of many more 
 Since I became President I have been to Europe Mexico Canada Brazil 
 Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands Wake Island and Hawaii I have 
 visited almost every State in the Union I have traveled 135,000 miles by 
 air 77,000 by rail and 17,000 by ship But the mail always followed me 
 and wherever I happened to be that 's where the office of the President 
 was 
 The greatest part of the President 's job is to make decisions big ones 
 and small ones dozens of them almost every day The papers may circulate 
 around the Government for a while but they finally reach this desk And 
 then there 's no place else for them to go The President whoever he is 
 has to decide He ca n't pass the buck to anybody No one else can do the 
 deciding for him That is his job 
 That 's what I 've been doing here in this room for almost 8 years And over 
 in the main part of the White House there 's a study on the second floor 
 a room much like this one where I have worked at night and early in the 
 morning on the papers I could n't get to at the office 
 Of course for more than 3 years Mrs. Truman and I were not living in the 
 White House We were across the street at the Blair House That was when 
 the White House almost fell down on us and had to be rebuilt I had a 
 study over at the Blair House too but living in the Blair House was not as 
 convenient as living in the White House The Secret Service would n't let me 
 walk across the street so I had to get in a car every morning to cross the 
 street to the White House office again at noon to go to the Blair House for 
 lunch and again to go back to the office after lunch and finally take an 
 automobile at night to return to the Blair House Fantastic is n't it But 
 necessary so my guards thought and they are the bosses on such 
 matters as that 
 Now of course we 're back in the White House It is in very good condition 
 and General Eisenhower will be able to take up his residence in the house 
 and work right here That 'll be much more convenient for him and I 'm very 
 glad the renovation job was all completed before his term began 
 Your new President is taking office in quite different circumstances than 
 when I became President 8 years ago On April 12th 1945 I 'd been 
 presiding over the Senate in my capacity as Vice President When the 
 Senate recessed about 5 o'clock in the afternoon I walked over to the 
 office of the Speaker of the House Mr. Rayburn to discuss pending 
 legislation As soon as I arrived I was told that Mr. Early one of President 
 Roosevelt 's secretaries wanted me to call I reached Mr. Early and he told 
 me to come to the White House as quickly as possible to 
 the Pennsylvania Avenue entrance and to come to Mrs. Roosevelt 's study 
 When I arrived Mrs. Roosevelt told me the tragic news and I felt the 
 shock that all of you felt a little later when the word came over the radio 
 and appeared in the newspapers President Roosevelt had died I offered 
 to do anything I could for Mrs. Roosevelt and then I asked the Secretary of 
 State to call the Cabinet together 
 At 7:09 p.m. I was sworn in as   Stone in the 
 Cabinet Room 
 Things were happening fast in those days The San Francisco conference to 
 organize the United Nations had been called for April 25th I was asked if 
 that meeting would go forward I announced that it would That was my 
 first decision 
 After attending President Roosevelt 's funeral I went to the Hall of the 
 House of Representatives and told a joint session of the Congress that I 
 would carry on President Roosevelt 's policies 
 On May 7th Germany surrendered The announcement was made on May 
 8th my 61st birthday 
 Mr. Churchill called me shortly after that and wanted a meeting with me 
 and Prime Minister Stalin of Russia Later on a meeting was agreed upon 
 and Churchill Stalin and I met at Potsdam in Germany 
 Meanwhile the first atomic explosion took place out in the New Mexico 
 desert 
 The war against Japan was still going on I made the decision that the 
 atomic bomb had to be used to end it I made that decision in the 
 conviction it would save hundreds of thousands of lives Japanese as well 
 as American Japan surrendered and we were faced with the huge 
 problems of bringing the troops home and reconverting the economy from 
 war to peace 
 All these things happened within just a little over 4 months from April to 
 August 1945 I tell you this to illustrate the tremendous scope of the work 
 your President has to do 
 All these emergencies and all the developments to meet them have 
 required the President to put in long hours usually 17 hours a day with 
 no payment for overtime I sign my name on an average 600 times a day 
 see and talk to hundreds of people every month shake hands with 
 thousands every year and still carry on the business of the largest going 
 concern in the whole world There is no job like it on the face of the earth 
 in the power which is concentrated here at this desk and in the 
 responsibility and difficulty of the decisions 
 I want all of you to realize how big a job how hard a job it is not for my 
 sake because I am stepping out of it but for the sake of my successor 
 He needs the understanding and the help of every citizen It is not enough 
 for you to come out once every 4 years and vote for a candidate and then 
 go back home and say Well I 've done my part now let the new President 
 do the worrying He ca n't do the job alone 
 Regardless of your politics whether you are Republican or Democrat your 
 fate is tied up with what is done here in this room The President is 
 President of the whole country We must give him our support as citizens 
 of the United States He will have mine and I want you to give him yours 
 I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when 
 the Cold War began to overshadow our lives I have had hardly a day in 
 office that has not been -embracing struggle this 
 conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the 
 world back into slavery and darkness And always in the background there 
 has been the atomic bomb 
 But when history says that my term of office saw the beginning of the Cold 
 War it will also say that in those eight years we have set the course that 
 can win it We have succeeded in carving out a new set of policies to attain 
 peace positive policies policies of world leadership policies that express 
 faith in other free people We have averted World War III up to now and 
 we may already have succeeded in establishing conditions which can keep 
 that war from happening as far ahead as man can see 
 These are great and historic achievements that we can all be proud of 
 Think of the difference between our course now and our course 30 years 
 ago After the First World War we withdrew from world affairs we failed 
 to act in concert with other peoples against aggression we helped to kill 
 the League of Nations and we built up tariff barriers that strangled world 
 trade This time we avoided those mistakes We helped to found and 
 sustain the United Nations We have welded alliances that include the 
 greater part of the free world And we 've gone ahead with other free 
 countries to help build their economies and link us all together in a healthy 
 world trade 
 Think back for a moment to the 1930 's and you will see the difference The 
 Japanese moved into Manchuria and free men did not act The Fascists 
 moved into Ethiopia and we did not act The Nazis marched into the 
 Rhineland into Austria into Czechoslovakia and free men were paralyzed 
 for lack of strength and unity of will 
 Think about those years of weakness and indecision and the World War II 
 which was their evil result Then think about the speed and courage and 
 decisiveness with which we have moved against the Communist threat 
 since World War II 
 The first crisis came in 1945 and 1946 when the Soviet Union refused to 
 honor its agreement to remove its troops from Iran Members of my 
 Cabinet came to me and asked if we were ready to take the risk that a firm 
 stand involved I replied that we were So we took our stand We made it 
 clear to the Soviet Union that we expected them to honor their agreement 
 and the Soviet troops were withdrawn from Iran 
 Then in early 1947 the Soviet Union threatened Greece and Turkey The 
 British sent me a message saying they could no longer keep their forces in 
 that area Something had to be done at once or the eastern Mediterranean 
 would be taken   On March 12th I went before the 
 Congress and stated our determination to help the people of Greece and 
 Turkey maintain their independence Today Greece is still free and 
 independent and Turkey is a bulwark of strength at a strategic corner of 
 the world 
 Then came the Marshall Plan which saved Europe the heroic Berlin airlift 
 and our military aid programs 
 We inaugurated the North Atlantic Pact the Rio Pact binding the Western 
 Hemisphere together and the defense pacts with countries of the Far 
 Pacific 
 Most important of all we acted in Korea I was in Independence Missouri 
 in June 1950 when Secretary Acheson telephoned me and gave me the 
 news about the invasion of Korea I told the Secretary to lay the matter at 
 once before the United Nations and I came on back to Washington 
 Flying back over the flatlands of the Middle West and over the 
 Appalachians that summer afternoon I had a lot of time to think I turned 
 the problem over in my mind in many ways but my thoughts kept coming 
 back to the 1930 's to Manchuria to Ethiopia the Rhineland Austria and 
 finally Munich 
 Here was history repeating itself Here was another probing action 
 another testing action If we let the Republic of Korea go under some 
 other country would be next and then another And all the time the 
 courage and confidence of the free world would be ebbing away just as it 
 did in the 1930 's And the United Nations would go the way of the League 
 of Nations 
 When I reached Washington I met immediately with the Secretary of 
 State the Secretary of Defense and General Bradley and the other civilian 
 and military officials who had information and advice to help me decide on 
 what to do We talked about that problem long and hard We considered 
 those problems very carefully 
 It was not easy to make the decision to send American boys again into 
 battle I was a soldier in the First World War and I know what a soldier 
 goes through I knew well the anguish that mothers and fathers and 
 families go through So I knew what was ahead if we acted in Korea 
 But after all this was said we realized that the issue was whether there 
 would be fighting in a limited area now or on a much larger scale later on 
 whether there would be some casualties now or many more casualties 
 later So a decision was reached The decision I believe was the most 
 important in my time as President of the United States 
 In the days that followed the most heartening fact was that the American 
 people clearly agreed with the decision 
 And in Korea our men are fighting as valiantly as Americans have ever 
 fought because they know they are fighting in the same cause of freedom 
 in which Americans have stood ever since the beginning of this Republic 
 Where free men had failed the test before this time we met the test 
 We met it firmly We met it successfully The aggression has been repelled 
 The Communists have seen their hopes of easy conquest go down the 
 drain The determination of free people to defend themselves has been 
 made clear to the Kremlin 
 As I have thought about our worldwide struggle with the Communists 
 these past eight years day in and day out I have never once doubted 
 that you the people of this country have the will to do what is necessary 
 to win this terrible fight against communism I know the people of this 
 country have that will and determination and I have always depended 
 upon it Because I have been sure of that I 've been able to make 
 necessary decisions even though they called for   us And 
 I have not been wrong in my judgment of the American people 
 That same assurance of our people 's determination will be General 
 Eisenhower 's greatest source of strength in carrying on this struggle 
 Now once in a while I 'll get a letter from some impatient person asking 
 Why do n't we get it over with Why do n't we issue an ultimatum make 
 all out war drop the atomic bomb 
 For most Americans the answer is quite simple We are not made that 
 way We are a moral people Peace is our goal with justice and freedom 
 We can not of our own free will violate the very principles that we are 
 striving to defend The whole purpose of what we are doing is to prevent 
 World War III Starting a war is no way to make peace 
 But if anyone still thinks that just this once bad means can bring good ends 
 then let me remind you of this We are living in the eighth year of the 
 atomic age We are not the only nation that is learning to unleash the 
 power of the atom A third world war might dig the grave not only of our 
 Communist opponents but also of our own society our world as well as 
 theirs 
 Starting an atomic war is totally unthinkable for rational men 
 Then some of you may ask when and how will the cold war end I 
 think I can answer that simply The Communist world has great resources 
 and it looks strong But there is a fatal flaw in their society Theirs is a 
 godless system a system of slavery there is no freedom in it no consent 
 The Iron Curtain the secret police the constant purges all these are 
 symptoms of a great basic weakness the rulers fear of their own people 
 In the long run the strength of our free society and our ideals will prevail 
 over a system that has respect for neither God nor man 
 Last week in my State of the Union Message to the Congress and I hope 
 you 'll all take the time to read it I explained how I think we will finally 
 win through 
 As the free world grows stronger more united more attractive to men on 
 both sides of the Iron Curtain and as the Soviet hopes for easy expansion 
 are blocked then there will have to come a time of change in the Soviet 
 world Nobody can say for sure when that is going to be or exactly how it 
 will come about  trouble in the satellite states or 
 by a change inside the Kremlin 
 Whether the Communist rulers shift their policies of their own free will or 
 whether the change comes about some other way I have not a doubt in 
 the world that the change will occur 
 I have a deep and abiding faith in the destiny of free men With patience 
 and courage we shall some day move on into a new era a wonderful 
 golden age an age when we can use the peaceful tools that science has 
 forged for us and do away with poverty and human misery everywhere on 
 earth 
 Think what can be done once our capital our skills our science most of 
 all atomic energy can be released from the tasks of defense and turned 
 wholly to peaceful purposes all around the world There is no end to what 
 can be done 
 I ca n't help but dream out loud just a little here The Tigris and the 
 Euphrates Valley can be made to bloom as it did in the time of Babylon and 
 Nineveh Israel can be made a country of milk and honey as it was in the 
 time of Joshua 
 There is a plateau in Ethiopia some 6,000 to 8,000 feet high that has 
 65,000 square miles of land just exactly like the corn belt of northern 
 Illinois Enough food can be raised there to feed a hundred million people 
 There are places in South America places in Colombia in Venezuela in 
 Brazil just like that plateau in Ethiopia --places where food could be raised 
 for millions of people 
 These things can be done and they are self liquidating projects If we can 
 get peace and safety in the world under the United Nations the 
 developments will come so fast we will not recognize the world in which 
 we now live 
 This is our dream of the future our picture of the world we hope to have 
 when the Communist threat is overcome 
 I 've talked a lot tonight about the menace of communism and our fight 
 against it because that is the overriding issue of our time But there are 
 some other things we 've done that history will record One of them is that 
 we in America have learned how to attain real prosperity for our people 
 We have 62 and 1/2 million people at work Businessmen farmers 
 laborers white collar people all have better incomes and more of the good 
 things of life than ever before in the history of the world There has n't 
 been a failure of an insured bank in nearly 9 years No depositor has lost a 
 cent in that period And the income of our people has been fairly 
 distributed perhaps more so than at any other time in recent history 
 We 've made progress in spreading the blessings of American life to all our 
 people There 's been a tremendous awakening of American conscience on 
 the great issues of civil rights equal economic opportunities equal rights 
 of citizenship and equal educational opportunities for all our people 
 whatever their race or religion or status of birth 
 So as I empty the drawers of this desk and as Mrs. Truman and I leave 
 the White House we have no regret We feel we have done our best in the 
 public service I hope and believe we have contributed to the welfare of 
 this Nation and to the peace of the world 
 When Franklin Roosevelt died I felt there must be a million men better 
 qualified than I to take up the Presidential task But the work was mine to 
 do and I had to do it And I 've tried to give it everything that was in me 
 Through all of it through all the years that I have worked here in this 
 room I 've been well aware that I did not really work alone that you 
 were working with me 
 No President could ever hope to lead our country or to sustain the burdens 
 of this office save as the people helped with their support I 've had that 
 help you have given me that support on all our great essential 
 undertakings to build the free world 's strength and keep the peace 
 Those are the big things Those are the things we have done together 
 For that I shall be grateful always 
 And now the time has come for me to say good night and God bless you

115,Avigdor Lieberman,Address at the 65th Session United Nations General Assembly,2010," Mr. President distinguished colleagues ladies and gentlemen 
 When I arrived yesterday in New York I received a phone call from a chairman of 
 one of the Jewish organizations who asked me how I am coping with all the 
 pressure which is being placed on Israel Surely he said it must be very 
 difficult I recalled an old joke which speaks of five Jews who changed the way 
 we see the world 
 Moses Law is everything 
 Jesus Love is everything 
 Marx Money is everything 
 Freud Sex is everything 
 Einstein Everything is relative 
 So I told him that everything is relative On one hand it is really difficult On the 
 other hand it is easier than before because because now we have a very stable 
 coalition stable government and we have the support of a majority of Israel 's 
 citizens 
 We are ready for a fair solution and we are ready to cooperate with the 
 international community However we are not ready to compromise our national 
 security or the vital interests of the State of Israel 
 At the outset I want to emphasize that contrary to what is often shown in the 
 international media the political arena in Israel is not divided between those who 
 seek peace and those who seek war Everyone Everyone wants peace and the 
 controversy in Israel centers on on the specific question of how to achieve this 
 peace how to reach the security and stability in the region And the question is 
 Why during the 17 years since we signed the Oslo Accords have we not arrived at 
 a comprehensive agreement signifying the end of the conflict and the removal of 
 future mutual claims 
 Despite all of the efforts of all the good people with the best of intentions 
 including Yitzhak Rabin Shimon Peres Benjamin Netanyahu Ehud Barak Peres 
 and Ehud Olmert despite the summit meetings at Camp David between Ehud 
 Barak and Yasser Arafat with the presence of former President Bill Clinton and 
 despite the Annapolis Summit between Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas we are 
 today still in a deadlock 
 In fact contrary to the prevalent view that the Israeli Palestinian conflict is the 
 heart of the instability in the Middle East or is the main reason for the region 's 
 numerous conflicts the reality is entirely different More than 90 of the wars 
 and war victims of the Middle East since the Second World War did not result from 
 the Israeli Palestinian conflict and are in no way connected to Israel stemming 
 rather from conflicts involving Muslims or conflicts between Arab States The 
 Iran Iraq war the Gulf war the wars between North and South Yemen the 
 Hamma atrocities in Syria and the wars in Algeria and Lebanon are just a few 
 examples of a list that goes on and on 
 The second flawed explanation for the longstanding conflict between Israel and 
 the Palestinian[s which has gained popularity is that the root of the problem is 
 the so called occupation the settlements in Judea and Samaria and the 
 settlers themselves Only the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in 
 Judea Samaria and Gaza so the argument goes will ensure peace in the region It 
 is sufficient to state a number of well known facts in order to refute this claim 
 Firstly all of Judea Samaria and Gaza were under Arab control for 19 years 
 between 48 and 67 During these 19 years no one tried to create a Palestinian 
 state 
 Peace agreements Peace agreements were achieved with Egypt and Jordan 
 despite the presence of settlements And the opposite is also true We evacuated 
 21 flourishing settlements in Gush Katif and we transferred more than 10,000 
 Jews and in return we have Hamas in power and thousands of missiles on Sderot 
 and southern Israel 
 The other misguided argument is is the claim that the Palestinian issue prevents 
 a determined international front against Iran This argument is not only flawed it 
 is completely irresponsible The same argument could be made that the 
 Palestinian issue prevents action on North Korea piracy in Somalia the 
 humanitarian crisis in Sudan or the challenge of Afghanistan Just as the 
 Khomeini Revolution had nothing to do with the Palestinian issue so too is the 
 Iranian decision to develop nuclear weapons unrelated 
 In truth the connection between Iran and the Israeli Palestinian conflict is 
 precisely reversed Iran can exist without Hamas Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah but 
 the terrorist organizations can not exist without Iran Relying on these proxies 
 Iran can at any given time foil any agreement between Israel and the Palestinians 
 or with Lebanon Thus in searching for a durable agreement with the Palestinians 
 one which will deal with the true roots of the conflict and which will endure for 
 many years one must understand that first the Iranian issue must be resolved 
 One must deal first with the root of the problem and not its symptoms 
 There are of course other problems as well which must be solved and this is not a 
 sufficient condition But it is nevertheless a necessary one In trying to resolve the 
 conflict between Israel and the Palestinians we are dealing with two types of 
 problems emotional problems and practical problems This is why the solution 
 must also be a two staged one 
 The emotional problems are first and foremost the utter lack of confidence 
 between the sides and issues such as Jerusalem recognition of Israel as the 
 nation state of the Jewish People and refugees Under these conditions we 
 should focus on coming up with a long term intermediate agreement something 
 that could take a few decades We need to raise an entire new generation that will 
 have mutual trust and will not be   extremist 
 messages To achieve a final status agreement we must understand that the 
 primary practical obstacle is the friction between two nations 
 As is true everywhere where there are two nations two religions two languages 
 with competing claims to the same land there is a friction and conflict Countless 
 examples of ethnic conflict around the world confirm this whether in the Balkans 
 the Caucuses Africa the Far East or the Middle East Where effective separation 
 has been achieved conflict has either been avoided or has been dramatically 
 reduced or resolved Consider the cases of the former Yugoslav republics the 
 splitup of Czechoslovakia and the independence of East Timor as cases in point 
 Thus the guiding principle for a final status agreement must not be land for peace 
 but rather exchange of populated territory Let me be very clear I 'm not speaking 
 about moving populations but rather about moving borders to better reflect 
 demographic realities 
 Ladies and gentlemen this is not an extraordinary insight and is far less 
 controversial than some may seek to claim In fact precisely this notion that a 
 mismatch between borders and nationalities is a recipe for conflict has long 
 been accepted as a virtual truism in the academic community Leading scholars 
 and highly respected research institutions have even coined the term Right Sizing 
 the State to capture the idea that states and nations must be in balance in order 
 to ensure peace This is not a controversial political policy It is an empirical truth 
 But beyond empirical truth there is historical truth almost 4000 years during 
 which the Jewish People were born in the Land of Israel while developing the 
 corpus of ethical and intellectual treasures that have been instrumental in giving 
 rise to Western Civilization Two thousand years of forced exile and interim 
  Mamelukes Ottomans and others can not and 
 never will impair the unbreakable bonds of the Jewish People to its homeland 
 Israel is not only where we are It is who we are 
 In closing let me remind everyone in this hall about the quote that adorns the 
 United Nations plaza outside spoken in Jerusalem almost 3000 years ago by the 
 Jewish prophet Isaiah

 They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into

 to the true peace   guide our two peoples in two 
 nation states living in peace and security

116,King George VI,First Radio Address With God 's Help We Shall Prevail,1939," In this grave hour perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every 
 household of my peoples both at home and overseas this message spoken with 
 the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your 
 threshold and speak to you myself 
 For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war 
 Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences 
 between ourselves and those who are now our enemies But it has been in vain 
 We have been forced into a conflict For we are called with our allies to meet the 
 challenge of a principle which if it were to prevail would be fatal to any civilized 
 order in the world 
 It is the principle which permits a state in the selfish pursuit of power to 
 disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges which sanctions the use of force or 
 threat of force against the sovereignty and independence of other states 
 Such a principle stripped of all disguise is surely the mere primitive doctrine that 
 might is right and if this principle were established throughout the world the 
 freedom of our own country and of the whole of the British Commonwealth of 
 Nations would be in danger But far more than this the peoples of the world 
 would be kept in the bondage of fear and all hopes of settled peace and of the 
 security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended 
 This is the ultimate issue which confronts us For the sake of all that we ourselves 
 hold dear and of the world order and peace it is unthinkable that we should 
 refuse to meet the challenge 
 It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across 
 the seas who will make our cause their own I ask them to stand calm and firm 
 and united in this time of trial The task will be hard There may be dark days 
 ahead and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield But we can only do 
 the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God 
 If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it ready for whatever service or 
 sacrifice it may demand then with God 's help we shall prevail 
 May He bless and keep us all",0.0143246091902256,0.0141935404390096,0.8657302856445312,0.0033189347013831,0.0711666196584701,0.0299727618694305,0.0012933160178363,0.0369274376417233,0.5363718820861679,75.63388888888889,0.4628099173553719,0.004098360655737705,0.14619883040935672,0.17084282460136674,27.11111111111111,0.0
117,Mike Pence,Speech at the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians,2017," Thank you Reverend Graham 
 It is a joy to be with all of you today to touch on a topic of enormous importance 
 not only in the life of people of faith across the world but enormous importance to 
 this Administration   And would you join me in congratulating Reverend Franklin 
 Graham for bringing together this first ever World Summit in Defense of 
 Persecuted Christians 
 Reverend Graham Senator Lankford Senator Blunt Congressman Smith 
 Congressman Hultgren leaders of faith in public life across this country and across 
 the world to my brothers and sisters in Christ   I often say when people have 
 asked me over the years what my philosophy is I tell them I ’m a Christian a 
 conservative and a Republican in that order 
 It is a distinct honor and frankly a humbling privilege to join you today at this 
 first ever Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians   Let me first and foremost 
 bring greetings from my friend a champion of the freedom of religion and the 
 freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights the 45th President of the United States of 
 America President Donald Trump 
 And I ’m here on behalf of the President as a tangible sign of his commitment to 
 defending Christians and frankly all who suffer for their beliefs across the wider 
 world   I stand here today as a testament to President Trump ’s tangible 
 commitment to reaffirm America ’s role as a beacon of hope and light and liberty to 
 inspire the world   You are here from across this land and from distant others 
 because America was and is and ever will be that shining city on a hill where men 
 and women of faith throughout our history have been able to walk and openly 
 worship their faith in God to the glory of God and it will ever be true in these 
 United States of America 
 And on behalf of our President let me personally thank our host today   This is a 
 man who I having just recognized once someone who I ’m blessed to call my 
 friend and the President is blessed to call a friend in Reverend Graham   And I 
 want to thank all of you Christian leaders from so many faith traditions who have 
 traveled to join us here today   To Cardinal Wuerl Archbishop Pierre Archbishop 
 Tikhon Metropolitan Hilarion Bishop Anis Patriarch Aphrem Dr. Zacharias Dr. 
 Michael Youssef Dr. Youssef and all the faith leaders are here today 
 Each one of you bear witness to the power of truth to transform lives   And the 
 people that you shepherd impact every corner of the world   And it ’s an honor to 
 be with all of you today 
 And of course let me also say how deeply humbling it is for me to stand today 
 before the courageous men and women who are with us who have stood without 
 apology for their faith in Christ and suffered persecution across the wider world 
 Reverend Sami Dagher Father Douglas Bazi Reverend Eliseo Villar Rashin 
 Soodmand Cheol Kang Ishak Shehata Ishmail and so many others who are here 
 with us today 
 Your faith inspires me   It humbles me   And it inspires all who are looking on 
 today   Would you all join me in thanking the courageous believers who have stood 
 for their faith under withering persecution who are with us here today   We are 
   On behalf of the President of the United States I say 
 from my heart to that number we are with you   We stand with you   And we are 
 here at this world ’s summit because of you 
 The Bible tells us All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be 
 persecuted   And those of you gathered here today are emblematic of millions 
 across the world   You ’ve persevered through the crucible of persecution   You 
 refused to be conformed to this world   You have chosen instead to be counted 
 with those outside the city gate for your faith   you bear witness 
 to the truth that brings us together here at this summit 
 The reality is across the wider world the Christian faith is under siege 
 Throughout the world no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred 
 than the followers of Christ   In more than 100 countries spread to every corner of 
 the globe from Iran to Eritrea Nigeria to North Korea over 215 million 
 Christians confront intimidation imprisonment forced conversion abuse assault 
 or worse for holding to the truths of the Gospel   And nowhere is this onslaught 
 against our faith more evident than in the very ancient land where Christianity 
 was born 
 Two millennia ago the Disciples of Christ the forefathers of our faith fanned out 
 from Israel in every direction to bring the good news that we proclaim across the 
 globe to this day   And in the valleys of Syria Palestine the plains of Nineveh and 
 the Nile on the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates they planted seeds of belief 
 They watered them with their sacrifice and their courage   They blossomed into 
 fruit and have borne fruit for the Gospel ever since 
 The Christian communities where the message of our Lord was first uttered and 
 embraced today though are often the targets of unspeakable atrocity   In Egypt 
 just recently we saw bombs explode in churches in the very midst of the 
 celebration of Palm Sunday   A day of hope was transformed into tragedy   I was 
 just this weekend with a pastor who from Egypt who spoke of the images that 
 day of seeing the palms the people carried into church on the ground marked 
 with the blood of the injured 
 In Iraq at the hands of extremists we ’ve actually seen monasteries demolished 
 priests and monks beheaded and the two millennia old Christian tradition in 
 Mosul virtually extinguished overnight   In Syria we see ancient communities 
 burned to the ground   We see believers tortured for confessing Christ and women 
 and children sold into the most terrible form of human slavery 
 Know today with assurance that President Trump sees these crimes for what they 
 are vile acts of persecution  for the Gospel of Christ 
 And so too does the President know those who perpetrate these crimes   They are 
 them the embodiment of evil in our time   He calls  Islamic 
 terrorists 
 From al Qaeda to al Shabaab from Boko Haram to the Taliban these extremist 
 groups seek to stamp out all religions that are not their own or even a version of 
 their own that they approve   And believers from every background have suffered 
 grievously at their hands   And this summit is about calling the attention to the 
 world to those tragic circumstances 
 The practitioners of terror harbor a special hatred for the followers of Christ and 
 none more so than the barbarians known as ISIS   That brutal regime shows a 
 savagery frankly unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages   And I believe 
 ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith 
 and it is time the world called it by name 
 Now Christianity faces unprecedented threats in the land where it was given life 
 its creed in an exodus unrivaled since the days of Moses in some communities   In 
 Syria the Christian population has plummeted from one and a quarter million to 
 only 500,000 in just the past six years   In Iraq followers of Christ have fallen by 
 80 percent in the past decade and a half due to the violence of extremism and acts 
 against Christian communities 
 But you know it was n’t always like this   I saw it firsthand in 2004 shortly after 
 the end of initial combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom   I traveled to 
 al Basrah in Iraq   It was my first time overseas and in that part of the world   And 
 I ’ll never forget we met with local leaders political leaders and religious leaders 
 our small delegation of congressmen 
 And there I witnessed something I ’ll never forget   I saw the local imam standing 
 in his traditional apparel and then as the local bishop arrived I saw the two of 
 them embrace warmly and began to speak with one another in animated ways 
 And the translator who was with me said that they were speaking about their 
 families   The imam was expressing the appreciation that the bishop had 
 expressed for condolences for the loss in their community   And there was warm 
 affection between them 
 I turned to the State Department official who was traveling with us and said not 
 knowing I said how long has there been a Christian church in al Basrah   And he 
 smiled and said about 1,500 years   Laughter   It ’s a community of common 
 purpose and affection   And it can be that way again 
 Our brother and sisters in faith I can assure you are being 
 of the faithful across this nation and across the world   You have the prayers of 
 our President and all the American people   And the Old Book says not be anxious 
 about anything but in every form of prayer and petition with thanksgiving present 
 your request to God and the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard 
 your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus 
 So know those of you that stare persecution in the face every day in distant lands 
 you have the prayers of the American people prayers of my family and you have 
 the prayers of the President of the United States 
 The suffering of Christians in the Middle East has stirred America to act and it 
 brings me here today   President Trump rightly said not long ago that of the 
 Christian church nobody has been treated worse in the Middle East   He ’s made 
 it clear that America will   Christ in this hour of need   Our 
 Administration is fully committed in bringing relief and comfort to believers not 
 only across the Middle East but across the world   This President knows the 
 terrorists will not stop until we stop them   And under President Donald Trump we 
 will stop them 
 In President Trump we not only have a leader who calls our  
 have a President who is confronting those who commit terror no matter the home 
 or hut or cave in which they hide   In President Trump I can promise you the 
 armed forces of the United States of America working with our allies in the region 
 in Iraq and Afghanistan we will not rest we will not relent until we hunt down 
 and destroy ISIS at its source 
 Because of the action of President Donald Trump ISIS is already on the run 
 Progress in Mosul is tangible   But the fight goes on   And I would say to each of 
 you persevere in prayer for those who wear the uniform and who are in this fight 
 Carry them in your prayers 
 I was out at Walter Reed Hospital not long ago with one of our servicemembers 
 who had been injured been Mosul   And like all of our courageous men and women 
 the only thing he wanted to do was get better and get back and fight   So carry 
 them in your prayers the effective and fervent prayer of a righteous people avail 
 of much   We ask you to avail yourselves to the opportunity to remember our 
 armed forces as they fight for our freedom across the world 
 And rest assured in the Middle East and North Africa anywhere terror strikes 
 America stands with those who are targeted and tormented for their belief 
 whether they ’re Christian Yazidi Druzes Shia Sunni or any other creed   The 
 President ’s commitment to protecting people of faith also will not end with the 
 elimination of ISIS or the eradication of terror   Under President Donald Trump 
 America will continue to condemn persecution of any kind of any faith any place 
 any time   We will stand against it with our ideals and with all our might 
 The freedom to worship God according to the dictates of our conscience is at the 
 very heart of who we are as Americans   In a very real sense America was 
  had the courage to cross the Atlantic motivated in so 
 many cases to come here so that they might have that freedom of religion 
 Truth is today for all the prosperity of the freedom of faith in America and other 
 free societies today according to the Pew Center nearly 80 percent of the human 
 family lives in places where restrictions on religion are either high or very 
 high   It ’s a five percent increase in a single year 
 Too many nations let the mob trample on the rights of the minority   Still more 
 prefer the coercion of the state to conviction of the soul   And the limitations 
 placed on people of belief have become too numerous to count   They range from 
 violence to vandalism forced conversion to crush free speech blasphemy laws 
 to building codes to detainment to death 
 Across the wider world Christians face this and more   But to be clear adherents 
 of other religions across the world have not been spared   And we will speak for 
 them and pray for them as well   For as history attests persecution of one faith is 
 ultimately the persecution of all faiths 
 President Trump will continue to stand without apology to protect this 
 fundamental freedom not just for our people but stand for it in the world   Since 
 the founding of our nation America has stood for the proposition that the right to 
 believe and the right to act on one ’s beliefs is the right of all peoples at all times 
 Protecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the 
 Trump Administration 
 Under President Donald Trump America will continue to stand for religious 
 freedom of all people of all faiths across the world   And I believe that all God ’s 
 children no matter their country or their creed can know with confidence that 
 God will continue to guide this nation to play our unique role on behalf of freedom 
 in the world   So have confidence 
 When I first ran for office back in 1999 okay when I first ran successfully for 
 office my wife presented me with a framed verse   It hung over our mantle for 
 12 years when I served in the Congress of the United States   And it hung over the 
 mantle of the Governor ’s Residence in Indiana   Now it hangs over the mantle in 
 the home of the Vice President of the United States of America 
 It simply reads some ancient words people of faith have clung to throughout the 
 millennia   And as we reflect on the great challenges at this world summit today 
 that believers Christ face across the globe I think we do well to claim this promise 
 again   It simply reads For I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you 
 and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future 
 True words when they were first every bit as true today 
 And so I want to encourage all of you today fellow believers in Christ cling to one 
 another in these challenging times   Know that America stands with you and will 
 labor alongside   But be confident because in the midst of it all he knows the plans 
 he has for us 
 And even as history records even in times of persecution this church has 
 prospered it ’s grown it ’s had hope and a future   And with your continued 
 courage and faith and with the strong and unwavering support of America and its 
 courageous President Donald Trump I know that future is bright indeed now and 
 in eternity 
 Thank you very much 
 May God bless your ministries in this land and around the world 
 God bless you all and these United States of America",0.0073293400928378,0.0069258315488696,0.0068172961473464,0.7696822285652161,0.1844908893108368,0.0087207555770874,0.0160336885601282,0.0692932350135739,0.3844451170298627,62.57218941504178,0.2665916760404949,0.018954448180984407,0.09396914446002805,0.045547246770904146,24.325925925925926,0.0
118,Huey P. Long,Radio Address Saint Vitus Dance Government,1935," Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Whether you do or do not believe in the divine rule of the Scriptures or in the 
 precepts of the Founders of this country or in the history of philosophy of all 
 nations if you will believe the four tables of arithmetic those of addition 
 subtraction multiplication and division you will agree with me that the wealth 
 of this land must be immediately redistributed to among our 125 million people if 
 America is to be saved as a country 
 For a moment ladies and gentlemen let me turn to the last radio address by our 
 President the honorable Franklin Delano Roosevelt It was delivered to the people 
 of our country on last Sunday night Now the President says that the people 
 can not understand just how good he has got them coming along Here are his 
 words quote 
 The job of creating a program for the nation 's welfare is in some 
 respects like the building of a ship At different points on the coast 
 where I often visit they build great seagoing ships 
 End quotations 
 You see what the President is talking about there is that when he goes out on that 
 five million dollar yacht they call the Nourmahal   Astor 
 who does lots of ship subsidy business for the United States where they get as 
 much as a thousand dollars for carrying one three cent letter he sometimes sees 
 them building a ship 
 Now let us quote further from the President quote 
 When one of these ships is under construction and the steel frames 
 have been set in the keel it is difficult for a person who does not know 
 ships to tell how it will finally look when it is sailing the high seas It is 
 that way with the making of a national policy 
 So we see our President of the United States some of us call him the Knight of 
 the Nourmahal says we 're confused because we can not see just how this thing 
 is going to look when he gets through making it Why to be sure all those millions 
 of hogs they killed all those cattle they shot down the milk they poured into the 
 rivers with the people starving for it all of the cotton they plowed under and wool 
 that they burned up with the people naked because they could not get it none of 
 us can see just how that is working out But the President says it is going to look 
 pretty when he gets the picture made up Surely it will look pretty It may not look 
 exactly like a song but it would be something like a dance the Saint Vitus dance.1 
 Now the President says this quote They know that the process of constructive 
 rebuilding of America can not be done in a day or a year end quote No and if he 
 is a fair sample of it they know it can not be done in a hundred years His process 
 of construction if you call it construction is to start out repairing the automobile 
 by first tearing off the top and then when the rain begins to beat in to hammer 
 the engine to pieces pare down the chassis and then wind   the 
 wheels That leaves only one thing to do he sends the bill for the work That bill 
 has now reached the size of over 30 billions of dollars six times more than all the 
 money in circulation in the United States 
 But now we 're going to get to something The President takes you into his 
 confidence Here is what he says next quote 
 The most difficult place in the world to get a clear and open perspective 
 of the country as a whole is in Washington That is why I occasionally 
 leave this scene of action for a few days to go fishing 
 I 'm going to read that again from the President quote 
 The most difficult place in the world to get a clear and open perspective 
 of the country as a whole is in Washington That is why I occasionally 
 leave this scene of action for a few days to go fishing 
 End quote 
 Now if you will observe closely ladies and gentlemen our President remarks that 
 he could not find out about the people of the country in Washington So he betook 
 himself on board the five million dollar yacht called the Nourmahal owned by 
 Vincent Astor where he was dead certain to find out just how things were getting 
 along This Nourmahal yacht sailed out into the British waters with the President 
 on board and soon thereafter was   and daughter in law of the 
 King of England the Duke and Duchess of Kent and now after some several days 
 or week ’s tour on the briny British waters enthroned on a five million dollar yacht 
 in company with the multi millionaire Astor and the Duke and Duchess of Kent 
 right out of England our great and benevolent President returns and says he went 
 on this fishing trip to find out what it is all about 
 This would be great comfort to the cotton hands who are not allowed to plant 
 cotton this year and who are naked because they ca n't get cotton goods and ca n't 
 make any money to buy it either It would do a great deal of help among the 
 starving who are told they must make contracts to reduce the quantity of food 
 stuffs so that there will not be too much to eat 
 Hooray for President Roosevelt 's fishing trip Let 's send him off again If he 
 does n't get any better understanding of the conditions in this country then he has 
 had in the last two years it 'd be a fine thing if Congress made a contract with Mr. 
 Vincent Astor and his five million dollar yacht not only to take the President out in 
 the British waters to fish for a week or two but to keep him there for several more 
 months then trust in luck that the country would find its way back to normal 
 before he got back 
 I did n't get to hear the message of our President It was delivered over the radio 
 because I was on board a train returning from Des Moines Iowa where I had 
 made a speech on last Saturday But I would say to you that at the place of Des 
 Moines I took a vote of the crowd some 20 thousand highly educated and 
 intelligent people   and without one single exception every hand was raised into 
 the air favoring the plan for redistribution of wealth and not one hand was raised 
 against it 
 But to get back to my point not having heard the President speak as I returned to 
 Washington I stepped over to my office where I was   He 
 said to me he says I heard the President speak last night And I asked him I 
 said What did he say He said He said to just keep waiting 
 But the President of the United States has long since forgotten the pledge and 
 promise which he made and on which he was nominated and elected to President 
 He promised in terms that were certain in language which could not be 
 misunderstood that he would break up the size of the big fortunes of this country 
 and use it to build the common people up from the ground to where they had 
 something on which to live in comfort He made that promise in the speech that he 
 delivered in Atlanta Georgia and it was that speech that was the basis on which I 
 declared for him as President I gave him the Louisiana delegation and helped him 
 to get several others on the promises that he made in that Atlanta speech He 
 made that promise when he accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party at 
 the Chicago convention He made that promise in other speeches which he 
 delivered during the campaign for President 
 I was sent into state after state North and South Dakota Nebraska and into 
 Kansas directly from the then candidate for President Mr. Roosevelt And I was 
 sent there to tell the people that when Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt became the 
 President of the United States that the big fortunes would be whittled down to a 
 reasonable limit in size and that thereby the common run of mankind would be 
 built up from the bottom at least to the point where all of our people had a home 
 and the comforts of life for their families with steady employment to all labor and 
 profit over production costs to all the farmers 
 What I say as to these   will not be   by 
 anyone else They are in indelible type They are in letters and pamphlets that 
 can not be disputed or questioned 
 But now in the third year of his Administration we find more of our people 
 unemployed than at any other time We find our houses empty and our people 
 hungry many of them half clothed and many of them not clothed at all 
 Mr. Hopkins announced 22 millions on the dole a new high water mark in that 
 particular sum a few weeks ago We find not only the people going further into 
 debt but that the United States is going further into debt The states are going 
 further into debt and the cities and towns are even going into bankruptcy The 
 condition has become deplorable 
 Instead of his promises the only remedy that Mr. Roosevelt has prescribed is to 
 borrow more money if he can and to go further into debt The last move was to 
 borrow five billion dollars more on which we must pay interest for the balance of 
 our lifetime and probably during the lifetime of our children And with it all there 
 stalks the slimy specter of want hunger destitution and pestilence all because 
 of the fact that in the land of too much to eat and of too much to wear our 
 President has failed in his promise to have these necessities of life distributed into 
 the hands of the people who have need of them 
 Now the jet black shadow of our want and misery came upon us 
 certain precision day after day month after month and year after year There 
 were investigations and studies made   and governmental 
 agencies to find out the cause of our trouble The whole matter was studied very 
 seriously up to as late as the year 1916 1920 
 The departments of the United States government and many of our statesmen and 
 newspapers and other journals openly stated that our growing trouble was caused 
 by too much of our wealth getting into the hands of too few of our people All of 
 them said that we had to turn things around the other way so as to have the 
 people owning less and less so as to have the masses owning more and more 
 That is that the few should own less and the more people should own more 
 But such things were said at a time before the money masters had muzzled the 
 public journals and before they had stifled the agencies of our government 's 
 research and publicity Here is what the government report rendered to Congress 
 in 1916 by the Industrial Relations Commission said quote 
 The sources through which industrial unrest springs are when stated in 
 full detail almost numerous but upon careful analysis of their real 
 character they would be found to group themselves almost without 
 exception under four main sources which include all the others These 
 four are 1 Unjust distribution of wealth and income 
 End quotation 
 Now the United States Industrial Relations Commission said this thing further 
 quote 
 The rich two percent of the people own 60 percent of the wealth The 
 middle class 33 percent of the people own 35 percent of the wealth 
 The poor 65 percent of the people own five percent of the wealth This 
 means in brief that a little less than two million people who would make 
 up a city smaller than Chicago own 20 percent more of the nation 's 
 wealth than all the other 90 million people 
 Close quotation 
 But at about this time of 1916 when these studies were being made our country 
 was thrown into the European war in the next year 1917 And when the shades of 
 1919 were lowered on the Peace Conference in Paris the billionaires and 
 multi millionaires of our finances had begun to apply their pressure throughout 
 America They sought to it thereafter that nothing more was said about too few 
 people owning too much or about too many people owning too little They muzzled 
 down on everything as tight as a drum 
 From 1920 to 1929 they changed businesses and banks and roped in all the 
 businesses and institutions of this country four times as tight as they had ever 
 held them In the first year of Hoover 's reign with more food stuffs and more 
 wearing apparel more manufactured articles more houses and more of 
 everything else than this country had ever seen in all of its history 
 notwithstanding all our abundance of everything for which our people had any 
 need there began to come about the first wave of our greatest hunger 
 nakedness homelessness and destitution in this land where there was too much 
 of everything 
 Why was that It was because of the fact that in spite of those conditions of too 
 few owning too much as we found to exist in 1916 that is a matter of fact in the 
 14 years time which followed from 1916 to 1930 those conditions grew to be two 
 times as bad as they were when they were complained about in 1916 
 The study of the Federal Trade Commission made in 1930 said this quote 
 The foregoing table shows that about one percent of the estimated 
 number of decedents owned about 59 percent of the estimated wealth 
 and that more than 90 percent was owned by about 13 percent of this 
 number 
 So you will see from a comparison ladies and gentlemen of these two 
 government reports one in 1916 and one in 1930 14 years apart that one 
 percent of the people owned as much in 1930 as two percent of the people owned 
 in 1916 
 So it proved that the government was correct in 1916 when it warned that too 
 much of the wealth in the hands of too few people was bringing on calamity For 
 when we reached 1930 with the conditions growing from bad to worst the whole 
 country collapsed and misery was brought about upon the population in the land 
 that was flowing with milk and honey 
 From the studies which I have made I charged in the United States Senate along 
 about 1933 and 1934 that four percent of the people owned 85 percent of the 
 wealth and that 96 percent of our people owned less than 16 percent of the 
 wealth I charged that 70 percent of the people of the United States did n't own 
 enough to pay their debts There was considerable ridicule made against the 
 figures which I gave During the last month of April of this very year about three 
 or four weeks ago the newspaper in New York City with the largest daily 
 circulation called The Daily News announced that it would send a special 
 representative to Washington to investigate the figures that I 'd given out 
 So it sent here a gentleman named Lowell Limpus and in the issue of The Daily 
 News of Monday April 8th 1935 just three weeks ago here is what that great 
 newspaper said I quote I now quote their own words quote Four percent own 
 87 percent of the United States News Survey Shows end quotation Now that is 
 the headline of this newspaper 
 I will read you from the article of this newspaper of April 8th 1935 three weeks 
 old This biggest paper of the world quote 
 The News recently suggested editorially that figures quoted in current 
 discussions on the distribution of wealth ought to be proved or 
  survey No figures being available The News 
 instituted a survey of its own The results are covered in a series of 
 articles of which this is the first 
 Now I continue to quote from this article of The Daily News Here is what they said 
 quote again 
 The News survey simply brings a picture up to date or as nearly so as 
 figures permit It reveals the following facts Less than four percent are 
 getting 38 and a half percent of the aggregate national income They 
 this four percent own and control more than 87 percent of the national 
 wealth The poor are getting poorer The national income is steadily 
 draining into fewer and fewer pockets The nation 's wealth is rapidly 
 coming under the control of a mere handful of men 
 End quotations from that newspaper 
 Now I 'm going to quote further from this same article in The Daily News I start 
 again quote The facts were there but they were ignored It remained for 
 Senator Huey Long Now notice this Daily News has ridiculed me for all these 
 many years what it says 
 The facts were there but they were ignored It remained for Senator 
 Huey Long and his ilk to force them to the attention of the public Huey 
 Long opened books 
 I 'm still quoting this paper 
 He adopted a technique which had never occurred to the students Huey 
 mounted a soapbox and beat a bass drum The public stopped to listen 
 The News survey reveals that he knew what he was talking about but so 
 did the students who preceded him 
 Close quotations 
 Yes my friends but if you knew the mire and the ridicule and the and the 
 distress that I had to come through in order to get those figures before the people 
 you 'd know what a public life might mean But now I will not take the time to read 
 you further what this big newspaper which checked up on my figures had said but 
 it took the time to write a big editorial and here is an editorial of April the 11th 
 1935 that they addressed to the balance of the newspapers of the United States to 
 say this Quote it 's April 11th 1935 
 When Huey Long in his Share the Wealth reply to General Johnson said 
 that one percent of Americans own 59 percent of America ’s wealth 
 while four percent own between 85 percent and 95 percent of the 
 wealth we knew he was a liar We intimated as much and added that 
 somebody ought to look into this question and get the true figures on 
 American wealth distribution in order to refute this demagogue Long 
 The News then assigned one of its most competent investigators Lowell 
 Limpus to the job of digging up the figures And so Lowell Limpus went 
 to Washington and worked for weeks in the Library of Congress and 
 elsewhere to root up the true figures with which to confound Long 
 The results of that research are now being published in The News and 
 to the consternation of many people including ourselves when we first 
 heard of them the results of that research show that Long had 
 essentially the correct dope The gist of the Limpus finding is this more 
 than 96 percent of the workers in the United States receive less than 
 the two thousand dollars a year which is regarded as sufficient only for 
 bare necessities 
 According to the United States Federal Trade Commission in 1926 one 
 percent of the people dying did own 59 percent of the wealth reported 
 and since that time the rich have been getting richer in proportion and 
 the poor have been getting poorer 
 When Limpus discovered that such was the picture of wealth 
 distribution in the United States he wired The News that his data would 
 prove very startling and that probably his findings could not be 
 published 
 It was decided after some deliberation to publish them nevertheless 
 In other words they decided to tell the truth in spite of themselves I continue to 
 quote 
 That decision was made on the ground that the ostrich act of sticking 
 our heads in the sand blinding ourselves to facts will only do us harm 
 in the long run To suppress these facts might dampen down some 
 unrest for a while But it is these facts which are causing the unrest 
 The eventual kickback would be much more serious if the facts 
 continued to be kept under cover And they are ominous facts 
 This is still quoting 
 It has happened time and again that when a nation 's wealth has 
 become concentrated into too few hands and ways of redistributing part 
 of it peaceably have not been worked out 
 Hear that They say 
 It has happened time and again that when a nation 's wealth has become 
 concentrated into a few hands and ways of redistributing part of it peaceably have 
 not been worked out ways of redistributing   been adopted in 
 time as in France and Russia That 's why you better pay attention to what I 'm 
 advocating ladies and gentlemen I 'm trying to do it peaceably 
 This newspaper says it 'll be done otherwise if you do n't do it Quote again from 
 The New York Daily News editorial 
 And as long as mass purchasing power stays down and continues to 
 shrink there will be over productions of bathtubs cars radios and so 
 forth which we like to think are elements in the American standard of 
 living 
 Will the balance of the newspapers do what this newspaper has done now I 've 
 finished quoting from it Or will they continue to be blind and lead the balance of 
 the blind into the mire of distress and ruin The brave journalistic souls of the 
 present day refuses to see the light 
 The Saturday Evening Post of this week dated May 4th 1935 has an editorial 
 about me as follows Headline says Facts are Stubborn Rarely does any 
 subject receive so much attention as Honorable Huey Long they say Continuing 
 to quote 
 There 's grave discussion as to how he will affect the fortunes of both 
 the New Deal and the Republican Party Everyone has an opinion as to 
 whether he is a menace or not the view taken depending on many 
 different factors The core of Senator Long 's plan is to take away from 
 all persons such wealth as they have in excess of one million dollars 
 giving them the right to choose what particular kinds of property they 
 would keep within the maximum permitted Of the total wealth that 's 
 appropriated he suggests that something less than half be used to 
 educate young people and that something over half be used to bring 
 families having less than five thousand dollars of property up to that 
 figure 
 I 'm continuing to quote from The Saturday Evening Post editorial quote This 
 country has no official figures or even accurate estimates concerning the 
 distribution of wealth Now that 's what The Saturday Evening Post said 
 Well now I 'm going to read to you from the same Saturday Evening Post of 
 September 23rd 1916 They say we have no figures on it Now let me read to 
 you from the same paper 19 years ago September 23rd 1916 quote The 
 man who studies wealth in the United States from statistics only quoting The 
 Saturday Evening Post quote further 
 will get nowhere with the subject because all of the statistics support 
 only an inconclusive suggestion Along one statistical line you can 
 figure out a nation bustling with wealth Along another a bloated 
 plutocracy comprising one percent 
 Listen to that 
 Along another line a bloated plutocracy comprising one percent of the 
 population lording it over a starveling hoard with only a thin margin of 
 merely well to do in between 
 End quotation 
 What is the matter with The Saturday Evening Post Here it is saying there are no 
 figures to show any such thing as I am saying And yet 20 years ago when you 
 were allowed to be honest Mr. Saturday Evening Post you told the people that 
 one percent of the people had a stranglehold on nearly everything the country had 
 in it Why this magazine does n't know that I was its scholar in 1916 That 
 magazine taught me to make this fight in part and now after 20 years of effort it 
 has failed to remember what it knew way back yonder which everybody else has 
 begun to find out at this late date 
 Now my friends you have heard me read how a great New York newspaper after 
 investigations declared that all I have said about the bad distribution of this 
 nation 's wealth is true But we have been about our work to correct this situation 
 That is why the Share our Wealth societies are forming in every nook and corner of 
 America They 'll be meeting tonight Soon there will be Share our Wealth societies 
 for everyone to meet They have a great work to perform 
 Here is what we stand for in a nutshell 
 Number one We propose that every family in America shall at least own a 
 homestead equal in value to not less than one third the average family wealth 
 The average family wealth of America at normal values is approximately 16 
 thousand dollars So our first proposition means that every family will have a 
 home and the comforts of a home up to a value of not less than around five 
 thousand dollars or a little more than that 
 Number two We propose that no family shall own more than 300 times the 
 average family wealth Which means that no family shall possess more than a 
 wealth of approximately five million dollars None to own less than five thousand 
 None to own more than five million We think that 's too much to allow to own but 
 at least it 's extremely conservative 
 Number three We propose that every family shall have an income equal to at least 
 one third of the average family income in America If all were allowed to work 
 there 'd be an income of from five thousand to 10 thousand dollars per family We 
 propose that one third would be the minimum We propose that no family will 
 have an earning of less than around two thousand to 25 hundred dollars and that 
 none will have more than 300 times the average less the ordinary income taxes 
 which means that a million dollars would be the limit on the highest income 
 We also propose to give the old age pensions to the old people not by taxing 
 them or their children   taxes upon the excess fortunes to 
 whittle them down and on the excess incomes and excess inheritances so that the 
 people who reach the age of 60 can be retired from the active labor of life and 
 given an opportunity to have surcease and ease in the balance of the life that they 
 have on earth 
 We also propose the care for the veterans including the cash payment of the 
 soldiers bonus 
 We likewise propose that there should be an education for every youth in this 
 land and that no youth would be dependent upon the financial means of his 
 parents in order to have a college education But the children will have as much 
 right to claim an education in order that they can be trained to do their full service 
 in this life through college as they have the right now to claim through grammar 
 school and through high school and that includes the living cost that children 's 
 education shall not depend upon the financial capacity of their parents but it shall 
 depend upon their own energy and upon their own ability to consume what they 're 
 taught in these schools and which they need to have taught to them 
 My plan is that our government should call in this surplus wealth above a few 
 million to any one family and then distribute out to those who have the need of the 
 same Some criticize that plan but it is but it is   I read 
 you the words of the Scripture quote 
 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one 
 soul Neither said any of them that all of the things which he possessed 
 was his own But they had all things common Neither was there any 
 among them that lacked For as many as were possessors of land or 
 houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold 
 and laid them down at the Apostles feet and distribution was made 
 unto every man according as he had needs 
 See Acts chapter 4 verses 32 to 36 
 Now you may criticize what I 'm saying but there it is written in the Bible It is our 
 purpose that every man should pursue a calling that means a living to himself and 
 his family in peace and comfort   that the shelter and home of every family 
 should be every man and his family That is as the Bible says it should be I read to 
 you the words of the Scripture again quote 
 And they shall beat their swords into plow shares and their spears into 
 pruning hooks Nations shall not lift up a sword against nation Neither 
 shall they learn war any more But they shall sit every man under his 
 vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid 
 That 's from Micah chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 
 We also say that none shall be too rich and none shall be too poor That 's the 
 philosophy of our Share our Wealth societies The Bible says that such is as it 
 should be I read you the words of the Scripture quote 
 Give me neither poverty nor riches Feed me with food convenient for 
 me lest I be full and deny thee and say who is the Lord Or lest I be 
 poor and steal and take the name of my God in vain 
 That 's from Proverbs chapter 20 verses 8 and 9 
 And we say that if the statutes of God are observed our people shall live in peace 
 and in comfort forever and that in this land of plenty none will sorrow The Bible 
 says so I read you the words again quote 
 If ye walk in my statutes ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in 
 your lands safely and I will give peace in the land and ye shall lie there 
 and nothing shall make you afraid 
 That 's from Leviticus chapter 26 verses 3 to 17 
 Now my friends let no one tell you that it is difficult to redistribute the wealth of 
 this land It matters not how rich or how great one may be When he dies his 
 wealth must be distributed anyway If Rockefeller died today they 'd had to 
 distribute his wealth The law of God shows how it has been done throughout 
 time See Nehemiah chapter 5 
 Nothing is more sensible or better understood than the redistribution of property 
 The laws of God command it It is required of all nations that are permitted to live 
 under the laws of the Lord See Leviticus chapter 26 
 Today our nation is cursed with an overload of debt Public and private debts 
 aggregate 262 billions of dollars That is more than two thousand dollars to every 
 person that they never will be able to pay Under the present set up this burden of 
 debt can never be paid It will forever condemn our people The laws of our Lord 
 command that such burden of debt must be wiped out of existence so that a 
 people may have a fair chance of life See Deuteronomy chapter 15 verses 1 and 
 2 
 So let us be about our work It is simple Why lie ye here idle There is enough for 
 all Let there be peace in the land Let our children be happy Our fight is old 
 Here in the United States Senate we 're trying to pay the soldiers bonus It is a 
 debt which is due the soldiers who fought our wars We 're fighting to keep the 
 Patman Bill2 which actually pays this bonus from being sidetracked The bill is 
 already passed in the House of Representatives Maybe you would like to wire your 
 United States senator tonight to ask him to stand for the Patman Bill tomorrow 
 morning 
 I would like to hear from any of you if you wish to concern yourself with the work 
 that we have in hand the Share our Wealth society If you want a copy of my 
 speech I will send it upon request You can write to me here in Washington D.C. 
 care of the United States Senate 
 Well my friends how wonderful and how great how fruitful to all this great 
 American land of ours can actually be We only have to eliminate useless greed 
 and provide that none shall be too big and none too small Beautiful America can 
 rise to the opportunity before it It means to us all every man a king

119,George Herbert Walker Bush,Presidential Inaugural Address,1989," Mr. Chief Justice Mr. President Vice President Quayle Senator Mitchell Speaker 
 Wright Senator Dole Congressman Michel and fellow citizens neighbors and 
 friends 
 There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our 
 history President Reagan on behalf of our Nation I thank you for the wonderful 
 things that you have done for America 
 I have just repeated word for word the oath   200 
 years ago and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed 
 his It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today not only because 
 this is our Bicentennial Inauguration but because Washington remains the Father 
 of our Country And he would I think be for today is the 
 concrete expression of a stunning fact our continuity these 200 years since our 
 government began 
 We meet on democracy 's front porch a good place to talk as neighbors and as 
 friends For this is a day when our nation is made whole when our differences for 
 a moment are suspended 
 And my first act as President is a prayer I ask you to bow your heads 
 Heavenly Father we bow our heads and thank You for Your love Accept 
 our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that 
 makes its continuance likely Make us strong to do Your work willing to 
 heed and hear Your will and write on our hearts these words Use 
 power to help people For we are given power not to advance our own 
 purposes nor to make a great show in the world nor a name There is 
 but one just use of power and it is to serve people Help us to 
 remember it Lord Amen 
 I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise We 
 live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better For a new breeze is 
 blowing and a world   reborn for in man 's heart if not 
 in fact the day of the dictator is over The totalitarian era is passing its old ideas 
 blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree A new breeze is blowing and 
 a nation   ready to push on There is new ground to be 
 broken and new action to be taken There are times when the future seems thick 
 as a fog you sit and wait hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path But 
 this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a 
 room called tomorrow 
 Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to 
 freedom Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the 
 door to prosperity The people of the world agitate for free expression and free 
 thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only 
 liberty allows 
 We know what works Freedom works We know what 's right Freedom is right 
 We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth through 
 free markets free speech free elections and the exercise of free will unhampered 
 by the state 
 For the first time in this century for the first time in perhaps all history man does 
 not have to invent a   live We do n't have to talk late into the 
 night about which form of government is better We do n't have to wrest justice 
 from the kings We only have to summon it from within ourselves We must act on 
 what we know I take as my guide the hope of a saint In crucial things unity in 
 important things diversity in all things generosity 
 America today is a proud free nation decent and civil a place we can not help but 
 love We know in our hearts not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact that this 
 country has meaning beyond what we see and that our strength is a force for 
 good But have we changed as a nation even in our time Are we enthralled with 
 material things less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice 
 My friends we are not the sum of our possessions They are not the measure of 
 our lives In our hearts we know what matters We can not hope only to leave our 
 children a bigger car a bigger bank account We must hope to give them a sense 
 of what it means to be a loyal friend a loving parent a citizen who leaves his 
 home his neighborhood and town better than he found it What do we want the 
 men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there That we 
 were more driven to succeed than anyone around us Or that we stopped to ask if 
 a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of 
 friendship 
 No President no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we 
 are But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a 
 difference if he can celebrate the quieter deeper successes that are made not of 
 gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls if he can do these things then 
 he must 
 America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle We 
 as a people have such a purpose today It is to make kinder the face of the Nation 
 and gentler the face of the world My friends we have work to do There are the 
 homeless lost and roaming There are the children who have nothing no love no 
 normalcy There are those who can not free themselves of enslavement to 
 whatever addiction drugs welfare the demoralization that rules the slums 
 There is crime to be conquered the rough crime of the streets There are young 
 women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they ca n't care 
 for and might not love They need our care our guidance and our education 
 though we bless them for choosing life 
 The old solution the old way was to think that public money alone could end 
 these problems But we have learned that is not so And in any case our funds are 
 low We have a deficit to bring down We have more will than wallet but will is 
 what we need We will make the hard choices looking at what we have and 
 perhaps allocating it differently making our decisions based on honest need and 
 prudent safety And then we will do the wisest thing of all We will turn to the only 
 resource we have that in times of need always grows the goodness and the 
 courage of the American people 
 I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others a new activism 
 hands on and involved that gets the job done We must bring in the generations 
 harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the 
 young For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is 
 stewardship And the generation born after the Second World War has come of 
 age 
 I have spoken of a thousand points of light of all the community organizations 
 that are spread like stars throughout the Nation doing good We will work hand in 
 hand encouraging sometimes leading sometimes being led rewarding We will 
 work on this in the White House in the Cabinet agencies I will go to the people 
 and the programs that are the brighter points of light and I will ask every member 
 of my government to become involved The old ideas are new again because they 
 are not old they are timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that 
 finds its expression in taking part and pitching in 
 We need a new engagement too between the Executive and the Congress The 
 challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate We must 
 bring the Federal budget into balance And we must ensure that America stands 
 before the world united strong at peace and fiscally sound But of course things 
 may be difficult We need compromise we have had dissension We need 
 harmony we have had a chorus of discordant voices 
 For Congress too has changed in our time There has grown a certain 
 divisiveness We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not 
 each other 's ideas are challenged but each other 's motives And our great parties 
 have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other It has been this way 
 since Vietnam That war cleaves us still But friends that war began in earnest a 
 quarter of a century ago and surely the statute of limitations has been reached 
 This is a fact The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to 
 be   A new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship 
 must be made new again 
 To my friends and yes I do mean friends in the loyal opposition and yes I 
 mean loyal I put out my hand I am putting out my hand to you Mr. Speaker I am 
 putting out my hand to you Mr. Majority Leader For this is the thing This is the 
 age of the offered hand We ca n't turn back clocks and I do n't want to But when 
 our fathers were young Mr. Speaker our differences ended at the water 's edge 
 And we do n't wish to turn back time but when our mothers were young Mr. 
 Majority Leader the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together 
 to produce a budget on which this nation could live Let us negotiate soon and 
 hard But in the end let us produce The American people await action They did n't 
 send us here to bicker They ask us to rise above the merely partisan In crucial 
 things unity""--and this my friends is crucial 
 To the world too we offer new engagement and a renewed vow We will stay 
 strong to protect the peace The offered hand is a reluctant fist but once made 
 strong and can be used with great effect There are today Americans who are held 
 against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for 
 Assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered Good will begets 
 good will Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on 
 Great nations like great men must keep their word When America says something 
 America means it whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble 
 steps We will always try to speak clearly for candor is a compliment but 
 subtlety too is good and has its place While keeping our alliances and 
 friendships around the world strong ever strong we will continue the new 
 closeness with the Soviet Union consistent both with our security and with 
 progress One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of 
 hope and strength over experience But hope is good and so are strength and 
 vigilance 
 Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable 
 satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes 
 fulfilled But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would 
 be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a 
 the flag  women who will tell her sons the words of the battle 
 hymns I do n't mean this to be sentimental I mean that on days like this we 
 remember that we are all part of a continuum inescapably 
 that bind 
 Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land And to them I say 
 thank you for watching democracy 's big day For democracy belongs to us all and 
 freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze And 
 to all I say No matter what your circumstances or where you are you are part of 
 this day you are part of the life of our great nation 
 A President is neither prince nor pope and I do n't seek a window on men 's souls 
 In fact I yearn for a greater tolerance an easy goingness about each other 's 
 attitudes and way of life 
 There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express 
 our intolerance The most obvious now is drugs And when that first cocaine was 
 smuggled in on a ship it may as well have been a deadly bacteria so much has it 
 hurt the body the soul of our country And there is much to be done and to be 
 said but take my word for it This scourge will stop 
 And so there is much to do and tomorrow the work begins I do not mistrust the 
 future I do not fear what is ahead For our problems are large but our heart is 
 larger Our challenges are great but our will is greater And if our flaws are 
 endless God 's love is truly boundless 
 Some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling and 
 sometimes it is that But I see history as a book with many pages and each day 
 we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning The new breeze blows a 
 page turns the story unfolds And so today a chapter begins a small and stately 
 story of unity diversity and generosity shared and written together

120,Rex Tillerson,Statement on Lifting the Blockade on Qatar,2017," Afternoon and I thank all of you for your patience I know you ’ve been waiting a 
 little while 
 Three weeks ago the President joined members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 
 a strong show of partnership repudiation of extremism and a plan to defeat 
 terrorism of all kinds in the region and around the world 
 Now the situation in the Arabian Gulf over the last few days is troubling to the 
 United States the region and to many people who are directly affected The 
 United States wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the spirit of the summit As 
 we combine efforts to defeat the military financial and ideological support of 
 terrorists we expect to see progress in the Arab world toward greater political 
 expression An important pathway to attack Islamic extremism and to prevent 
 political activism from escalating into violence is to allow marginalized voices 
 opportunities for political expression 
 But this process requires regional and global consensus and mutual 
 understanding The GCC summit creates a platform to achieve this consensus and 
 understanding We call for calm and thoughtful dialogue with clear expectations 
 and accountability among the parties in order to strengthen relationships We ask 
 that there be no further   We call on Qatar to 
 be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors Qatar has a history of supporting 
 groups that have spanned the spectrum of political expression from activism to 
 violence The emir of Qatar has made progress in halting financial support and 
 expelling terrorist elements from his country but he must do more and he must do 
 it more quickly 
 Others must also continue to eliminate factions of support for violent 
 organizations within their own borders Again that was a commitment made by all 
 at the summit We call on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates 
 Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar There are humanitarian 
 consequences to this blockade We are seeing shortages of food families are being 
 forcibly separated and children pulled out of school We believe these are 
 unintended consequences especially during this Holy Month of Ramadan but they 
 can be addressed immediately 
 The blockade is also impairing U.S. and other international business activities in 
 the region and has created a hardship on the people of Qatar and the people 
 whose livelihoods depend on commerce with Qatar The blockade is hindering U.S. 
 military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS 
 We support the emir of Kuwait ’s efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to this 
 agreement and progress toward eliminating all forms of support for terrorism 
 military financial moral or ideological The U.S. will support these mediation 
 efforts along with the emir of Kuwait 
 In the last few days I have spoken to many leaders in the region And as I said to 
 all of them we know you are stronger together It is clear to me based on these 
 conversations that the elements of a solution are available The GCC must emerge 
 united and stronger to show the world the GCC ’s resolve in its fight against 
 violence and terrorism and its commitment to countering the threat from 
 extremism 
 Our expectation is that these countries will immediately take steps to de escalate 
 the situation and put forth a good faith effort to resolve their grievances they have 
 with each other

121,Donald J. Trump,Address to the People of Poland,2017," Thank you very much   That 's so nice   The United States has many great 
 diplomats but there is truly no better ambassador for our country than our 
 beautiful First Lady Melania   Thank you Melania   That was very nice 
 We 've come to your nation to deliver a very important message America loves 
 Poland and America loves the Polish people   Thank you 
 The Poles have not only greatly enriched this region but Polish Americans have 
 also greatly enriched the United States and I was truly proud to have their 
 support in the 2016 election 
 It is a profound honor to stand in this  to the Warsaw 
 Uprising and to address the Polish nation that so many generations have dreamed 
 of a Poland that is safe strong and free 
 President Duda and your wonderful First Lady Agata have welcomed us with the 
 tremendous warmth and kindness for which Poland is known around the world 
 Thank you    My sincere and I mean sincerely thank both of them   And to Prime 
 Minister Syzdlo a very special thanks also 
 We are also pleased that former President Leck Walesa so famous for leading the 
 Solidarity Movement has joined us today also 
 Thank you   Thank you   Thank 
 you 
 On behalf of all Americans let me also thank the entire Polish people for the 
 generosity you have shown in welcoming our soldiers to your country   These 
 soldiers are not only brave defenders of freedom but also symbols of America ’s 
 commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic Europe 
 We are proudly joined on  British and Romanian 
 soldiers   Thank you    Thank you   Great job 
 President Duda and I have just come from an incredibly successful meeting with 
 the leaders participating in the Three Seas Initiative   To the citizens of this great 
 region America is eager to expand our partnership with you   We welcome 
 stronger ties of trade and commerce as you grow your economies And we are 
 committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy so Poland and 
 its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy 
 Mr. President I congratulate you along with the President of Croatia on your 
 leadership of this historic Three Seas Initiative Thank you 
 This is my first visit to Central Europe as President and I am thrilled that it could 
 be right here at this magnificent beautiful piece of land   It is beautiful    Poland is 
 the geographic heart of Europe but more importantly in the Polish people we see 
 the soul of Europe   Your nation is great because your spirit is great and your spirit 
 is strong 
 For two centuries Poland suffered constant and brutal attacks   But while Poland 
 could be invaded and occupied and its borders even erased from the map it could 
 never be erased from history or from your hearts   In those dark days you have 
 lost your land but you never lost your pride 
 So it is with true admiration that I can say today that from the farms and villages 
 of your countryside to the cathedrals and squares of your great cities Poland 
 lives Poland prospers and Poland prevails 
 Despite every effort to transform you oppress you or destroy you you endured 
 and overcame   You are the proud nation of Copernicus think of that Chopin 
 Saint John Paul II   Poland is a land of great heroes 
 And you are a people who 
 know the true value of what you defend 
 The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a 
 future in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war 
 For Americans Poland has been a symbol of hope since the beginning of our 
 nation   Polish heroes and American patriots fought   our War of 
 Independence and in many wars that followed   Our soldiers still serve together 
 today in Afghanistan and Iraq combating the enemies of all civilization 
 For America ’s part we have never given up on freedom and independence as the 
 right and destiny of the Polish people and we never ever will 
 Our two countries share a special bond   and national 
 characters   It ’s a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and 
 bled and died for freedom 
 The signs of this friendship stand in our nation ’s capital   Just steps from the 
 White House we ’ve raised statues of men with names like Pułaski and Kościuszko 
 The same is true in Warsaw where street signs carry the name of George 
 Washington and a monument stands to one of the world ’s greatest heroes Ronald 
 Reagan 
 And so I am here today not just to visit an old ally but to hold it up as an example 
 for others who seek freedom and who wish to summon the courage and the will to 
 defend our civilization    The story of Poland is the story of a people who have 
 never lost hope who have never been broken and who have never ever forgotten 
 who they are 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump Thank you   Thank you so much   Thank you   Thank you so 
 much   Such a great honor   This is a nation more than one thousand years old 
 Your borders were erased for more than a century and only restored just one 
 century ago 
 In 1920 in the Miracle of Vistula Poland stopped the Soviet army bent on 
 European conquest    Then 19 years later in 1939 you were invaded yet again 
 this   from the west and the Soviet Union from the east 
 That ’s trouble   That ’s tough 
 Under a double occupation the Polish people endured evils beyond description the 
 Katyn forest massacre the occupations the Holocaust the Warsaw Ghetto and the 
 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising the destruction of this beautiful capital city and the 
 deaths of nearly one in five Polish people   A vibrant Jewish population the 
 largest in Europe was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically 
 murdered millions of Poland ’s Jewish citizens along with countless others during 
 that brutal occupation 
 In the summer of 1944 the Nazi and Soviet armies were preparing for a terrible 
 and bloody battle right here in Warsaw Amid that hell on earth the citizens of 
 Poland rose up to defend their homeland   I am deeply honored to be joined on 
 stage   heroes of the Warsaw Uprising 
 Audience Chanting 
 President Trump What great spirit   We salute your noble sacrifice and we pledge 
 to always remember your fight for Poland and for freedom   Thank you   Thank 
 you 
 This monument reminds us that more than 150,000 Poles died during that 
 desperate struggle to overthrow oppression From the other side of the river the 
 Soviet armed forces stopped and waited   They watched as the Nazis ruthlessly 
 destroyed the city viciously murdering men women and children   They tried to 
 destroy this nation 
 But there is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one 
 could destroy   The Polish martyr Bishop Michael Kozal said it well More 
 horrifying than a defeat of arms is a collapse of the human spirit 
 Through four decades of communist rule Poland and the other captive nations of 
 Europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom your faith your laws 
 your history your identity indeed the very essence of your culture and your 
 humanity   Yet through it all you never lost that spirit    Your oppressors tried to 
 break you but Poland could not be broken 
 And when the day came on June 2nd 1979 and one million Poles gathered around 
 Victory Square for their very first mass with their Polish Pope that day every 
 communist in Warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon 
 come crashing down    They must have known it at the exact moment during Pope 
 John Paul II ’s sermon when a million Polish men women and children suddenly 
 raised their voices in a single prayer   A million Polish people did not ask for 
 wealth   They did not ask for privilege   Instead one million Poles sang three 
 simple words We Want God 
 In those words the Polish people recalled the promise of a better future   They 
 found new courage to face down their oppressors and they found the words to 
 declare that Poland would be Poland once again 
 As I stand here today before this incredible crowd this faithful nation we can still 
 hear those voices that echo through history   Their message is as true today as 
 ever   The people of Poland the people of America and the people of Europe still 
 cry out We want God 
 Together with Pope John Paul II the Poles reasserted their identity as a nation 
 devoted to God   And with that powerful declaration of who you are you came to 
 understand what to do and how to live   You stood in solidarity against oppression 
 against a lawless secret police against a cruel and wicked system that 
 impoverished your cities and your souls   And you won   Poland prevailed   Poland 
 will always prevail 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump Thank you   You were supported in that victory over communism 
 by a strong alliance of free nations in the West that defied tyranny   Now among 
 the most committed members of the NATO Alliance Poland has resumed its place 
 as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong whole and free 
 A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe and they know that   A 
 strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world    One hundred years after 
 the entry of American forces into World War I the transatlantic bond between the 
 United States and Europe is as strong as ever and maybe in many ways even 
 stronger 
 This continent no longer confronts the specter of communism   But today we ’re in 
 the West and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way 
 of life   You see what ’s happening out there   They are threats   We will confront 
 them   We will win   But they are threats 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump We are   ideology one that 
 seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe   America and 
 Europe have suffered one terror attack after another   We ’re going to get it to 
 stop 
 During a historic gathering in Saudi Arabia I called on the leaders of more than 50 
 Muslim nations to join together to drive out this menace which threatens all of 
 humanity   We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of 
 their territory and their funding and their networks and any form of ideological 
 support that they may have   While we will always welcome new citizens who 
 share our values and love our people our borders will always be closed to 
 terrorism and extremism of any kind 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump We are fighting hard against radical Islamic terrorism and we 
 will prevail   We can not accept those who reject our values and who use hatred to 
 justify violence against the innocent 
 Today the West is also   that seek to test our will 
 undermine our confidence and challenge our interests   To meet new forms of 
 aggression including propaganda financial crimes and cyberwarfare we must 
 adapt our alliance to compete effectively in new ways and on all new battlefields 
 We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and 
 its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran and to instead join the 
 community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in 
 defense of civilization itself 
 Finally on both sides of the Atlantic our citizens are 
 danger one firmly within our control   This danger is invisible to some but 
 familiar to the Poles the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the 
 vitality and wealth of the people   The West became great not because of 
 paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their 
 dreams and pursue their destinies 
 Americans Poles and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and 
 sovereignty   We must work together to confront forces whether they come from 
 inside or out from the South or the East that threaten over time to undermine 
 these values and to erase the bonds of culture faith and tradition that make us 
 who we are    If left unchecked these forces will undermine our courage sap our 
 spirit and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies 
 But just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in Poland we 
 know that these forces too are doomed to fail if we want them to fail   And we do 
 indeed want them to fail    They are doomed not only because our alliance is 
 strong our countries are resilient and our power is unmatched   Through all of 
 that you have to say everything is true   Our adversaries however are doomed 
 because we will never forget who we are   And if we do n’t forget who are we just 
 ca n't be beaten   Americans will never forget   The nations of Europe will never 
 forget   We are the fastest and the greatest community   There is nothing like our 
 community of nations   The world has never known anything like our community of 
 nations 
 We write symphonies   We pursue innovation   We celebrate our ancient heroes 
 embrace our timeless traditions and customs and always seek to explore and 
 discover brand new frontiers 
 We reward brilliance   We strive for excellence and cherish inspiring works of art 
 that honor God   We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech 
 and free expression 
 We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success   We put faith and 
 family not government and bureaucracy at the center of our lives   And we 
 debate everything   We challenge everything   We seek to know everything so that 
 we can better know ourselves 
 And above all we value the dignity of every human life protect the rights of every 
 person and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom   That is who we are 
 Those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations as allies and as a 
 civilization 
 What we have what we inherited from our and you know this better than 
 anybody and you see it today with this incredible group of people what we 've 
 inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before   And if we fail 
 to preserve it it will never ever exist again   So we can not fail 
 This great community of nations has something else in common In every one of 
 them it is the people not the powerful who have always formed the foundation of 
 freedom and the cornerstone of our defense   The people have been that 
 foundation here in Poland as they were right here in Warsaw and they were 
 the foundation from the very very beginning in America 
 Our citizens did not win freedom together did not survive horrors together did 
 not face down evil together only to lose our freedom to a lack of pride and 
 confidence in our values   We did not and we will not   We will never back down 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump As long as we know our history we will know how to build our 
 future   Americans know that a strong alliance of free sovereign and independent 
 nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests   That is why my 
 administration has demanded that all members of NATO finally meet their full and 
 fair financial obligation 
 As a result of this insistence billions of dollars more have begun to pour into 
 NATO   In fact people are shocked   But billions and billions of dollars more are 
 coming in from countries that in my opinion would not have been paying so 
 quickly 
 To those who would criticize our tough stance I would point out that the United 
 States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand 
 firmly behind Article 5 the mutual defense commitment 
 Words are easy but actions are what matters   And for its own protection and 
 you know this everybody knows this everybody has to know this Europe must 
 do more   Europe must demonstrate that it believes in its 
 money to secure that future 
 That is why we applaud Poland for its decision to move forward this week on 
 acquiring from the United States the battle tested PATRIOT Air and Missile 
 Defense System the best anywhere in the world 
 That is also why we salute the 
 Polish people for being one of the NATO countries that has actually achieved the 
 benchmark for investment in our common defense   Thank you   Thank you 
 Poland   I must tell you the example you set is truly magnificent and we applaud 
 Poland   Thank you 
 We have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money it is a 
 commitment of will   Because as the Polish experience reminds us the defense of 
 the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to 
 prevail and be successful and get what you have to have   The fundamental 
 question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive   Do we have the 
 confidence in our values to defend them at any cost   Do we have enough respect 
 for our citizens to protect our borders   Do we have the desire and the courage to 
 preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it 
 We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on 
 Earth but if we do not have strong families and strong values then we will be 
 weak and we will not survive    If anyone forgets the critical importance of these 
 things let them come to one country that never has   Let them come to Poland 
 And let them come here to Warsaw and learn the story of the Warsaw Uprising 
 When they do they should learn about Jerusalem Avenue   In August of 1944 
 Jerusalem Avenue was one of the main roads running east and west through this 
 city just as it is today   Control of that road was crucially important to both sides 
 in the battle for Warsaw   The German military wanted it as their most direct route 
 to move troops and to form a very strong front   And for the Polish Home Army 
 the ability to pass north and south across that street was critical to keep the 
 center of the city and the Uprising itself from being split apart and destroyed 
 Every night the Poles put up sandbags amid machine gun fire and it was 
 horrendous fire to protect a narrow passage across Jerusalem Avenue   Every 
 day the enemy forces knocked them down again and again and again   Then the 
 Poles dug a trench   Finally they built a barricade   And the brave Polish fighters 
 began to flow across Jerusalem Avenue   That narrow passageway just a few feet 
 wide was the fragile link that kept the Uprising alive 
 Between its walls a constant stream of citizens and freedom fighters made their 
 perilous just perilous sprints   They ran across that street they ran through that 
 street they ran under that street all to defend this city   The far side was 
 several yards away recalled one young Polish woman named Greta   That 
 mortality and that life was so important to her   In fact she said The mortally 
 dangerous sector of the street was soaked in the blood   It was the blood of 
 messengers liaison girls and couriers 
 Nazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed   Anybody who crossed they were being 
 shot at   Their soldiers burned every building on the street and they used the 
 Poles as human shields for their tanks in their effort to capture Jerusalem Avenue 
 The enemy never ceased its relentless assault on that small outpost of civilization 
 And the Poles never ceased its defense 
 The Jerusalem Avenue passage required constant protection repair and 
 reinforcement but the will of its defenders did not waver even in the face of 
 death   And to the last days of the Uprising the fragile crossing never ever failed 
 It was never ever forgotten   It was kept   people 
 The memories of those who perished in the Warsaw Uprising cry out across the 
 decades and few are clearer than the memories of those who died to build and 
 defend the Jerusalem Avenue crossing   Those heroes remind us that the West was 
 saved with the blood of patriots that each generation must rise up and play their 
 part in its defense and that every foot of ground and every last inch of 
 civilization is worth defending with your life 
 Our own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield it begins with our 
 minds our wills and our souls   Today the ties that unite our civilization are no 
 less vital and demand no less defense than that bare shred of land on which the 
 hope of Poland once totally rested   Our freedom our civilization and our survival 
 depend on these bonds of history culture and memory 
 And today as ever Poland is in our heart and its people are in that fight    Just as 
 Poland could not be broken I declare today for the world to hear that the West 
 will never ever be broken   Our values will prevail   Our people will thrive   And 
 our civilization will triumph 
 Audience Donald Trump   Donald Trump   Donald Trump 
 President Trump Thank you   So together let us all fight like the Poles for 
 family for freedom for country and for God

122,Brett Kavanaugh,U.S. Supreme Court Nomination Acceptance Speech,2018," Mr. President thank you   Throughout this process I ’ve witnessed firsthand your 
 appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary 
 No President has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from 
 more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination 
 Mr. President I am grateful to you and I am   in me 
 Thank you 
 Thirty years ago President Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme 
 Court   The framers established that the Constitution is designed to secure the 
 blessings of liberty   Justice Kennedy devoted his career to securing liberty   I am 
 deeply honored to be nominated to fill his seat on the Supreme Court 
 My mom and dad are here   I am their only child   When people ask what it ’s like to 
 be an only child I say It depends on who your parents are 
 I was lucky   My mom was a teacher   In the 1960s and 70s she taught history at 
 two largely African American public high schools in Washington D.C. McKinley 
 Tech and H.D. Woodson   Her example taught me the importance of equality for all 
 Americans 
 My mom was a trailblazer   When I was 10 she went to law school and became a 
 prosecutor   My introduction to law came at our dinner table when she practiced 
 her closing arguments   Her trademark line was Use you common sense   What 
 rings true   What rings false   That ’s good advice a juror and for a son 
 One of the few women prosecutors at that time she overcame barriers and 
 became a trial judge   The President introduced me tonight as Judge Kavanaugh 
 But to me that title will always belong to my mom 
 My dad went to law school at night while working full time   He has an 
 unparalleled work ethic and has passed down to me his passion for playing and 
 watching sports   I love him dearly 
 The motto of my Jesuit high school was Men for others   I ’ve tried to live that 
 creed   I ’ve spent my career in public service from the executive branch and the 
 White House to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   I ’ve served with 17 
 other judges each of them a colleague and a friend 
 My judicial philosophy is straightforward   A judge must be independent and must 
 interpret the law not make the law   A judge must interpret statutes as written 
 And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written 
 tradition and precedent 
 For the past 11 years I ’ve taught hundreds of students primarily at Harvard Law 
 School   I teach that the Constitution ’s separation of powers protects individual 
 liberty and I remain grateful to the dean who hired me Justice Elena Kagan 
 As a judge I hire four law clerks each year   I look for the best   My law clerks 
 come from diverse backgrounds and points of view   I am proud that a majority of 
 my law clerks have been women 
 I am part of the vibrant Catholic community in the D.C. area   The members of that 
 community disagree about many things but we are   to 
 serve   Father John Enzler is here   Forty years ago I was an altar boy for Father 
 John   These days I help him serve meals to the homeless at Catholic Charities 
 I have two spirited daughters Margaret and Liza   Margaret loves sports and 
 she loves to read   Liza loves sports and she loves to talk I have tried to create 
 bonds with my daughters like my dad created with me   For the past seven years I 
 have coached my daughter ’s basketball teams   The girls on the team call me 
 Coach K.   I am proud of our Blessed Sacrament team that just won the city 
 championship 
 My daughters and I also go to lots of games   Our favorite memory was going to 
 the historic Notre Dame Yukon women ’s basketball game at this year ’s Final Four 
 Unforgettable 
 My wife Ashley is a West Texan   A graduate of Abilene Cooper Public High School 
 and the University of Texas   She is now the town manager of our community   We 
 met in 2001 when we both worked in the White House   Our first date was on 
 September 10 2001   The next morning I was a few steps behind her as the 
 Secret Service shouted at all of us to sprint out the front gates of the White House 
 because there was an inbound plane   In the difficult weeks that followed Ashley 
 was a source of strength for President Bush and for everyone in this building 
 Through bad days and so many better days since then she ’s been a great wife and 
 inspiring mom   I thank God every day for my family 
 Tomorrow I begin meeting with members of the Senate which plays an essential 
 role in this process   I will tell each senator that I revere the Constitution   I 
 believe that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional

123,Jimmy Carter,Address to the People of Cuba,2002," I appreciate President Castro 's invitation for us to visit Cuba and have been 
 delighted with the   hospitality we have received since arriving here It is a great 
 honor to address the Cuban people 
 After a long and agonizing struggle Cuba achieved its independence a century 
 ago and a complex relationship soon developed between our two countries The 
 great powers in Europe and Asia viewed imperialism as the natural order of the 
 time and they expected the United States to colonize Cuba as the Europeans had 
 done in Africa The United States chose instead to help Cuba become independent 
 but not completely The Platt Amendment gave my country the right to intervene 
 in Cuba 's internal affairs until President Franklin Roosevelt had the wisdom to 
 repeal this claim in May 1934 
 The dictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown more than 43 years ago and a few 
 years later the Cuban revolution aligned with the Soviet Union in the Cold War 
 Since then our nations have followed different philosophical and political paths 
 The hard truth is that neither the United States nor Cuba has managed to define a 
 positive and beneficial relationship Will this new century find our neighboring 
 people living in harmony and friendship I have come here in search of an answer 
 to that question 
 There are some in Cuba who think the simple answer is for the United States to lift 
 the embargo and there are some in my country who believe the answer is for your 
 president to step down from power and allow free elections There is no doubt that 
 the question deserves a more comprehensive assessment 
 I have restudied the complicated history in preparation for my conversations with 
 President Castro and realize that there are no simple answers I did not come 
 here to interfere in Cuba 's internal affairs but to extend a hand of friendship to 
 the Cuban people and to offer a vision of the future for our two countries and for 
 all the Americas That vision includes a Cuba fully integrated into a democratic 
 hemisphere participating in a Free Trade Area of the Americas and with our 
 citizens traveling without restraint to visit each other I want a massive student 
 exchange between our universities I want the people of the United States and 
 Cuba to share more than a love of baseball and wonderful music I want us to be 
 friends and to respect each other 
 Our two nations have been trapped in a destructive state of belligerence for 42 
 years and it is time for us to change our relationship and the way we think and 
 talk about each other Because the United States is the most powerful nation we 
 should take the first step First my hope is that the Congress will soon act to 
 permit unrestricted travel between the United States and Cuba establish open 
 trading relationships and repeal the embargo I should add that these restraints 
 are not the source of Cuba 's economic problems Cuba can trade with more than 
 100 countries and buy medicines for example more cheaply in Mexico than in the 
 United States But the embargo freezes the existing impasse induces anger and 
 resentment restricts the freedoms of U.S. citizens and makes it difficult for us to 
 exchange ideas and respect 
 Second I hope that Cuba and the United States can resolve the 40 year old 
 property disputes with some creativity In many cases we are debating ancient 
 claims about decrepit sugar mills an antique telephone company and many other 
 obsolete holdings Most U.S. companies have already absorbed the losses but 
 some others want to be paid and many Cubans who fled the revolution retain a 
 sentimental attachment for their homes We resolved similar problems when I 
 normalized relations with China in 1979 I propose that our two countries 
 establish a blue ribbon commission to address the legitimate concerns of all sides 
 in a positive and constructive manner 
 Third some of those who left this beautiful island have demonstrated vividly that 
 the key to a flourishing economy is to use individual entrepreneurial skills But 
 many Cubans in South Florida remain angry over their departure and their divided 
 families We need to define a future so they can serve as a bridge of reconciliation 
 between Cuba and the United States 
 Are such normal relationships possible I believe they are 
 Except for the stagnant relations between the United States and Cuba the world 
 has been changing greatly and especially in Latin America and the Caribbean As 
 late as 1977 when I became president there were only two democracies in South 
 America and one in Central America Today almost every country in the Americas 
 is a democracy 
 I am not using a U.S. definition of democracy The term is embedded in the 
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights which Cuba signed in 1948 and it was 
 defined very   other countries of the Americas in the 
 Inter American Democratic Charter last September It is based on some simple 
 premises all citizens are born with the right to choose their own leaders to define 
 their own destiny to speak freely to organize political parties trade unions and 
 nongovernmental groups and to have fair and open trials 
 Only such governments can be members of the OAS join a Free Trade Area of the 
 Americas or participate in the Summits of the Americas Today any regime that 
 takes   will be ostracized as was shown in the 
 rejection of the Venezuelan coup last month 
 Democracy is a framework that permits a people to accommodate changing times 
 and correct past mistakes Since our independence the United States has rid itself 
 of slavery granted women the right to vote ended almost a century of legal racial 
 discrimination and just this year reformed its election laws to correct problems 
 we faced in Florida 18 months ago 
 Cuba has adopted a socialist government where one political party dominates and 
 people are not permitted to organize any opposition movements Your constitution 
 recognizes freedom of speech and association but other laws deny these 
 freedoms to those who disagree with the government 
 My nation is hardly perfect in human rights A very large number of our citizens 
 are incarcerated in prison and there is little doubt that the death penalty is 
 imposed most harshly on those who are poor black or mentally ill For more than 
 a quarter century we have struggled unsuccessfully to guarantee the basic right 
 of universal health care for our people Still guaranteed civil liberties offer every 
 citizen an opportunity to change these laws 
 That fundamental right is also guaranteed to Cubans It is gratifying to note that 
 Articles 63 and 88 of your constitution allows citizens to petition the National 
 Assembly to permit a referendum to change laws if 10,000 or more citizens sign it 
 I am informed that such an effort called the Varela Project has gathered 
 sufficient signatures and has presented such a petition to the National Assembly 
 When Cubans exercise this freedom to change laws   vote the 
 world will see that Cubans and not foreigners will decide the future of this 
 country 
 Cuba has superb systems of health care and universal education but last month 
 most Latin American governments joined a majority in the United Nations Human 
 Rights Commission in calling on Cuba to meet universally accepted standards in 
 civil liberties I would ask that you permit the International Committee of the Red 
 Cross to visit prisons and that you would receive the U.N. Human Rights 
 Commissioner to address such issues as prisoners of conscience and the treatment 
 of inmates These visits could help refute any unwarranted criticisms 
 Public opinion surveys show that a majority of people in the United States would 
 like to see the economic embargo ended normal travel between our two countries 
 friendship between our people and Cuba to be welcomed into the community of 
 democracies in the Americas At the same time most of my fellow citizens believe 
 that the issues of economic and political freedom need to be addressed by the 
 Cuban people 
 After 43 years of animosity we hope that someday soon you can reach across the 
 great divide that separates our two countries and say We are ready to join the 
 community of democracies and I hope that Americans will soon open our arms to 
 you and say We welcome you as our friends",0.0277652032673358,0.009357513859868,0.0038872784934937,0.8338962197303772,0.1089347451925277,0.0118800606578588,0.004278945736587,0.090879329004329,0.4444069264069265,48.45717495547339,0.3662851196670135,0.026570048309178744,0.09577114427860696,0.06688741721854305,27.147540983606557,0.0
124,James H. Billington,Address to the National Press Club on the Library of Congress,1989," words 
 Libraries today face an unprecedented challenge of preserving memory activating 
 intellect and serving the public agenda in an age that is in many ways 
 present minded spectator oriented and self indulgent and in a culture which has 
 tended oftentimes one might add to in a sense take libraries for granted as part 
 of the landscape rather than to let their realities and their possibilities feed the 
 imagination for what they might do 
 Now the Library of Congress is not just the largest as has been already said of 
 the Library it 's the most diverse and the most accessible repository of human 
 knowledge in the history of the world And it 's an important but still partially 
 undiscovered national asset for dealing with some of these problems that are 
 bearing in on us bearing in on us I think from three concentric circles It 's a 
 place of opportunity therefore for responding to the key problems pressing in on 
 us today from these three universes that are moving in on us the world the 
 nation and this city of government itself 
 Having a universal library on Capitol Hill at the dawn of the Information Age is 
 rather like having the world 's largest gold reserve sitting under the treasury as 
 you go on the gold standard You have to mine it and America must mine more of 
 the gold for as we enter the time when we must increasingly 
 rather than just our power it is a resource that is not just desirable but 
 indispensible.1 
 It 's a reservoir of knowledge that is quite simply a unique instrument for both 
 competing with and understanding better the rest of the world It 's 86 million 
 items now and I regret to tell you with 31,000 arriving a day you can see 
 how it builds up fairly rapidly in all languages and all media We 're currently 
 collecting in more than 450 languages It houses larger Hispanic American and 
 Arab collections for instance than exist in either Latin America or the Arab world 
 It possesses the largest Chinese Japanese Korean Russian Polish you name it 
 collections anywhere outside those countries outside those countries where 
 those languages are spoken And it provides as well the world 's largest 
 collection of maps documentary photographs sheet music movies and much 
 else 
 Now to appreciate the global reach not just the richness of contents of this 
 unique and not very fully understood institution just consider with me for a 
 minute some of its activities with respect to just one country that the introducer 
 has mentioned the Soviet Union within just one recent period of about a half 
 year 
 At the Washington Summit in December 1987 Soviet General Secretary Mikhail 
 Gorbachev asked to see a work on the USSR 's Congressional 
 Research Service while his arms negotiator was independently meeting with the 
 author of another such work from the CRS 
 In late January 1988 the Library of Congress officials participated in a unique 
 international scholarly conference in Leningrad that opened the Russian churches 
 celebration of its millennium last year and at the same time laid the groundwork 
 for the Library of Congress own exhibit exhibition and conference on the same 
 subject in the spring here in Washington 
 In February the largest library disaster of modern times destroyed or damaged 
 four million volumes of Russia 's original vehicle for intellectual westernization the 
 priceless Academy of Sciences Library in Leningrad The Library of Congress 
 immediately sent two delegations saved many   Soviets to 
 use vacuum freeze drying for 210,000 volumes and to use phased conservation 
 techniques for saving 180,000 foreign language volumes We have since signed a 
 protocol so that the Library of Congress is now formally the principal coordinator 
 of an international replacement and recovery effort 
 Meanwhile in Washington the Library was showing Soviet movies all spring to 
 prominent American leaders going to the Soviet Union and providing opportunities 
 to talk with a number of the directors and actors in these movies which are in 
 many ways the forward arm of glasnost2 in the Library 's Mary Pickford Theater 
 President Reagan speaking at Moscow University Gorbachev 's alma mater 
 during the Moscow Summit in June presented to its library the first major primary 
 materials for studying American history ever made available to undergraduates 
 there microfilms from the Library of Congress of the complete papers of 
 Washington Jefferson and Lincoln 
 Shortly thereafter Soviet journalists and publishers visiting the Library of 
 Congress agreed for the first time to publish American children 's books in the 
 Soviet Union in cooperation with the Library 's plans which the Congress and 
 President have since endorsed formally to make this year 1989 the Year of the 
 Young Reader 
 Shortly after that the Library hosted the first bi national conference ever held 
 between Soviet and American library and information specialists agreeing then on 
 a bi national conference next year in Moscow between the Library of Congress and 
 the Lenin Library on the role of libraries in the development of both countries 
 Many Soviet officials now see open access to knowledge as a key prerequisite that 
 they had not thought about earlier for any serious democratization in that country 
 and some have even discussed the possibility of linking their national library to a 
 legislature on the model of the Library of Congress in order to get it out from 
 under a ministry which is always more inherently subject to direct police controls 
 Now every one of the seven Library of Congress involvements with the USSR in a 
 seven month period that I have just itemized every one came from a different 
 part of the Library the Congressional Research Service which is the world 's 
 largest public policy think thank the Office of the Librarian the Conservation 
 Office the Manuscript Division which houses the papers of almost all American 
 Presidents up to Coolidge the Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound 
 Division the small center for the Book and Children 's Literature and the large 
 departments of processing and research Services 
 America ’s continuing decline in international and foreign language studies has 
 occurred precisely during a time when we have become as a nation increasingly 
 interdependent with other countries economically ecologically and in all kinds of 
 other ways At a major conference on knowledge and power the the transcript 
 of which is available for any of you who would like to see it last summer 
  of Congress Council of Scholars Secretary of State 
 George Shultz identified the persistence of religious and ethnic particularism as 
 one of the most perplexing and recurrent problems that he encountered during his 
 term of office 
 The Library of Congress in its current restoration of its glorious Thomas 
 Jefferson Building hopes to include reading rooms for all major cultures of the 
 world in that building transforming it into a living universal museum of the 
 written word of all peoples the closest thing anywhere to the world 's memory the 
 place to find out what is unique about other people their achievements their 
 anguish their aspirations 
 The Library ’s John Adams  to it is the place for using 
 new modes of data and scientific analysis so that common things can be measured 
 and compared Our special reading rooms for the social and natural sciences there 
 will we hope increasingly aid our international competitiveness We hope to 
 interest the productive private sector in making fuller use of our little known 
 collection of nearly four million technical and scientific reports as well as our 
 unmatched ability to render foreign technical literature into English with a staff of 
 more than 100 fluent in Chinese and the same number --a little more in 
 Japanese and well over 200 fluent in Russian 
 The Library 's own unparalleled foreign languages collections have just been 
 augmented I am pleased to announce for the first time anywhere today by the 
 acquisition of the National Translation Center from the University of Chicago The 
 Center 's holdings date from the 1920s and include more than 350,000 complete 
 translations of scientific and technical articles and research papers and 
 bibliographical information on another 600,000 translations We are excited about 
 the prospect of being able to make this asset available to the nation ’s research 
 and development community perhaps in the context of a broader service of 
 rendering the foreign works of importance into English 
 But how is this national Library to serve the nation beyond helping as I have 
 already mentioned that first circle of the world relating to international 
 understanding and competitiveness The attempt to answer this question in a 
 nation that has some 115,000 other libraries and many other private and public 
 institutions dealing with knowledge and information has been a driving force 
 behind our unprecedented just completed year long internal examination of what 
 this Library 's mission and strategy should be for its third century which will begin 
 in the year 2000 
 For guidelines towards the library of the future I turn first and foremost to an 
 internal management and planning committee of 27 mid level members of the 
 Library of Congress staff but also to members of Congress to external 
 management consultants to a national advisory committee of 29 distinguished 
 librarians publishers and business people and to 11 national forums held in 
 different locations all over the country with about 10,000 librarians and interested 
 citizens participate Now on the basis of all this and nearly 1,000 written staff 
 suggestions plus oral suggestions from a thousand staff members who attended 
 the 12 open forums I conducted all last year we slowly agreed on a set of 
 institutional values that define a mission and suggest a new organizational 
 concept towards which we are now actively moving along with the outlines of 
 some new ways for serving the nation that second of those circles around 
 around us 
 This Library has a contribution to make both as leader and partner to the 
 educational process in this country broadly understood helping combat not just 
 the illiteracy that is growing alarmingly in this country but also the growing 
 aliteracy of which my predecessor Dan Bornstein used to speak aliteracy being 
 those who can read but rarely do and finally also the tendency even among 
 educated people towards a passive spectatorism a self indulgent cynicism which 
 undermines the active intellect and the hopeful spirit which are the two 
 indispensible items to a healthy and improving democracy 
 The Library 's main service to the nation since the beginning of this century has 
 traditionally been providing inexpensive cataloguing for other libraries But the 
 time has now come to begin also sharing the contents of this Library with the 
 broader community New technologies make it possible to reproduce key elements 
 of our massive special collections of sights and sounds as well as instructive and 
 inspirational facsimiles of the unique primary record we have of the American 
 experience at inventing a self governing constitutional system and making 
 democracy work in a large modern society 
 We are accordingly initiating a new project for sharing old things through the 
 new technologies in a series we are calling American Memory American Memory 
 will use optical disc and other advanced technologies to offer access in local 
 libraries to such collections as the first editions of Steven Foster 's music the 
 Library 's vast holdings of unpublished dramas who knows what Mute 
 Inglorious Miltons""3 here may rest in the files of our Copyright Department 
 American folksongs recorded in the 30s and 40s before these were wide widely 
 available turn of the century motion pictures that are not in any other collections 
 out of print and obscure works of local history and genealogy of which we are the 
 unique repositories in many cases 
 The series will establish American Memory corners providing local libraries both 
 with exciting new technology that will interest young people not otherwise 
 attracted sometimes to libraries in an audiovisual age but at the same time will 
 provide solid content that will increase the inventory in local libraries and will 
 raise questions that will lead viewers and readers to the books in the library all 
 around them for further answers and for further satisfaction of a curiosity that 
 has to be engaged before it can be satisfied 
 American Memory will quietly increase a present minded generation ’s knowledge 
 of and pride in its own past and local libraries and schools will be able to build 
 their own teaching materials around what will be permanent enrichments to their 
 library 's collections 
 We believe that this collection will also interest foreigners who are more 
 fascinated than ever with our ongoing experience as well as the American people 
 and that it will help them understand us better just as our reinforcement of 
 foreign area studies here in Washington will help us understand them better 
 Now the Library is also preserving our National   the world 's 
 pioneer in new methods of preservation technology Library specialists 
 specialists have patented developed and tested a mass gas deacidification 
 process4 that will extend  of   as 500 years 
 books that are often decomposing because of the high acid content used in most 
 papers since the middle of the 19th century 
 The Library also of course serves this nation as its reference checker of last 
 resort in  by correspondence The Library of Congress 
 last year answered nearly three million inquiries more than a million from the 
 general public through our various research divisions nearly a half million from 
 Congress through the Congressional Research Service another half million to the 
 Copyright Office and more than 700,000 to the Law Library which of course 
 includes the world 's largest international law library 
 Well the task ahead lies in continuing our historically free services to Congress 
 scholars and the general public while exploring the possibilities of fee based 
 services or in kind contributions from groups in the productive sector whose 
 inventiveness and competitiveness would be greatly 
 here that they have yet to discover Getting the champagne into the wine cellar if 
 you like our wine cellar then out of the bottle into everybody 's six pack 
 sharing it through online facts or disc technologies as they come on stream 
 This Library deals of course in movable information and it 's thus in an excellent 
 position to help overcome a danger that concerns me I think with the general 
 cultural explosion in Washington what I would call the creeping Versailles 
 syndrome There is a tendency to bring things into Washington to enjoy them 
 here rather than get them out into the nation to benefit the ordinary citizenry and 
 this is to some extent inevitable when you 're dealing with artifacts that are 
 difficult to move But we who deal in movable information in the electronic age 
 have special opportunities and I think moral obligations to the public to use the 
 new technologies to share the materials here with those who can not come here 
 The last of the three concentric circles that pose special service opportunities for 
 the information systems of the future is this remarkable city of Washington itself 
 Its rise as a major intellectual center has gone largely unnoticed unlike the earlier 
 emergence of Washington as a center of artistic and theatrical activity The growth 
 of public policy think tanks of humanistic research centers of scientific research 
 in a city that includes this Library the National Archives and other government 
 information centers has made Washington in many ways the information capital of 
 the world as it enters this Information Age Whole fields of thought flourish almost 
 uniquely in Washington the aesthetics of power rather than academic political 
 science political economy rather than university or business econometrics 
 strategic studies rather than academic international relations and so forth 
 But Washington is a city still in which it is easier for genius to visit than to stay it 
 is easier to write than think It 's a city that is present minded adversarially 
 organized advocacy driven There is therefore a particular need for the 
 objectivity that the Library of Congress and its Congressional Research Service 
 provides as well as for the independent academic standards of excellence that 
 flourish in this Library and are   academic all star group 
 the Council of Scholars   scholars as our most recent one for 
 them Sir Isaiah Berlin 
 We would hope to celebrate the life of the mind here the way this city now 
 celebrates the performing and visual arts and the way the Library already does for 
 poetry and chamber music for instance Perhaps we need special honors for those 
 fields in which America excels but the Nobel Committee does not give awards the 
 humanities and the social sciences And indeed it is progress in these that is 
 essential to the very survival and not merely the enjoyment of our civilization 
 This city needs peaks of independent intellectual quality and it needs to honor the 
 intellect The world and the nation needs sic new ideas that will be not produced 
 that will not be be produced   or programs The soil is 
 needed and the soil for new ideas must be   of freedom and 
 access to the full human record which the Library of Congress uniquely offers 
 But there 's also a need for some inner moral impulse to serve which I believe our 
 staff has both exemplified and strengthened during the year long review process 
 we ’ve just completed at the Library of Congress Our planning process began with 
 a three month discussion of values Some people thought that was just an idle 
 exercise or platitudinous one but they came up with values which we now 
 recognize as institutional commitments above all service and quality fairness 
 and participation 
 These produced a service mission that recognizes and builds on the dedication and 
 skill of the public servants who work so hard in our and in other libraries And it 's 
 produced a radically different concept of the way of doing business away from the 
 traditional paramilitary structure which is of organization which is rigid 
 hierarchical and focused on protecting turf inside the organization towards a 
 new flexible participatory team oriented system that is focused on expanding 
 service to our constituents outside It recognizes the breadth and depth of 
 knowledge of the staff and seeks to get them off the 19th century assembly line 
 into the 21st century information network to see this Library as pivotal players in 
 a continuum of scholarly communication that provides access to the old in order to 
 foster creation of the new 
 This Library is determined then to be both catalyst and participant in the 
 scholarly process that which transforms information into knowledge and 
 knowledge into wisdom as it seeks to serve the Congress and the nation that has 
 so generously and imaginatively sustained it The Library is organizing 
 exhibitions and programs this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the United 
 States Congress which created this remarkable intellectual conglomerate shortly 
 after moving the new Capitol to Washington 
 The Founding Fathers sensed early what others including many of the Russian 
 visitors we talked to are just discovering now that both a body of knowledge 
 and access to it must aspire towards universality if you are to aspire towards true 
 democracy The first meeting of the Continental Congress in 74 in Philadelphia 
 occurred in a library building and building the Library of they 
 debated borrowing privileges even before they got around to to deriving out of 
 all those books just how it was that a free people was going to devise an equitable 
 way of governing themselves 
 Building the Library of Congress in Washington on Jefferson 's example and around 
 his own book collection the Congress through the years has linked an institution 
 that makes laws for our people with a treasury of learning for all people And this 
 is surely one of the great and least sung historic accomplishments 
 The fear of all of us who are its custodians is that it could somehow someday be 
 lost eroded all manner of ways it could go out like the Great Library at 
 Alexandria which was the culminating really accomplishment of the ancient 
 world The great hope is that it may recreate the the creativity that prevailed in 
 Alexandria before that terrible fire of an Eratosthenes who first measured the 
 earth 's circumference of a Callimachus the first bibliographer who worked there 
 and an Erasistratus who discovered the pumping action of the heart 
 America may have the opportunity if it has the heart and the vision and will to 
 produce a civilization like that of the Greeks but perhaps even better because it 
 could be continental multi ethnic and without slavery But if this is to happen in 
 the Information Age we will have to bring more of Athens into this particular 
 realm the frontiers of truth into this center of power And we will need new 
 private sector Carnegies to reinforce continuing federal support if we are to help 
 share with America and the world a richness that should surely not be confined 
 just to this city 
 We here in Washington have a unique opportunity to participate in the unending 
 human effort to winnow information into knowledge to distill that knowledge into 
 wisdom and to bring it all to bear on the enduring American Dream that whatever 
 our problems are today tomorrow can still be better than yesterday

 weapons The time for talk ended last night 
 We ’re here today because three permanent members of the United Nations 
 Security Council acted The United Kingdom France and the United States acted 
 not as revenge not as punishment not as a symbolic show of force We acted to 
 deter the future use of chemical   Syrian regime responsible 
 for its atrocities against humanity 
 We can all see that a Russian disinformation campaign is in full force this morning 
 But Russia ’s desperate attempts at deflection can not change the facts A large 
 body of information indicates that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in 
 Douma on April 7 There is clear information demonstrating Assad ’s culpability 
 The pictures of dead children were not fake news They were the result of the 
 Syrian regime ’s barbaric inhumanity And they were the result of the regime and 
 Russia ’s failure to live up to their international commitments to remove all 
 chemical weapons from Syria The United States France and the United Kingdom 
 acted after careful evaluation of these facts 
 The targets we selected were at the heart of the Syrian regime ’s illegal chemical 
 weapons program The strikes were carefully planned to minimize civilian 
 casualties The responses were justified legitimate and proportionate The United 
 States and its allies did everything we could to use the tools of diplomacy to get 
 rid of Assad ’s arsenal of chemical weapons 
 We did not give diplomacy just one chance We gave diplomacy chance after 
 chance Six times That ’s how many times Russia vetoed Security Council 
 resolutions to address chemical weapons in Syria Our efforts go back even 
 further In 2013 the Security Council passed a resolution that required the Assad 
 regime to destroy its stockpile of chemical weapons 
 Syria committed to   Weapons Convention meaning it could 
 no longer have chemical weapons on its soil 
 President Putin said Russia would guarantee that Syria complied We hoped that 
 this diplomacy would succeed in putting an end to the horror of chemical attacks 
 in Syria But as we see from the past year that did not happen 
 While Russia was busy protecting the regime Assad took notice The regime knew 
 it could act with impunity and it did 
 In November Russia used its veto to kill the Joint Investigative Mechanism the 
 main tool we had to figure out who used chemical weapons in Syria Just as Russia 
 was using its veto the Assad regime used sarin leading to dozens of injuries and 
 deaths 
 Russia ’s veto was the green light for the Assad regime to use these most barbaric 
 weapons against the Syrian people in complete violation of international law The 
 United States and our allies were not going to let that stand Chemical weapons 
 are a threat to us all They are a unique threat a type of weapon so evil that the 
 international community agreed they must be banned 
 We can not   Russia trash every international norm that we stand 
 for and allow the use of chemical weapons to go unanswered And just as the 
 Syrian regime ’s use of chemical weapons last weekend was not an isolated 
 incident our response is part of a new course charted last year to deter future use 
 of chemical weapons 
 Our Syrian strategy has not changed However the Syrian regime has forced us to 
 take action based on their repeated use of chemical weapons Since the April 2017 
 chemical attack at Khan Sheikhoun the United States has imposed hundreds of 
 sanctions on individuals and entities involved in chemical weapons use in Syria 
 and North Korea We have designated entities in Asia the Middle East and Africa 
 that have facilitated chemical weapons proliferation We have revoked the visas of 
 Russian intelligence officers in response to the chemical attack in Salisbury We 
 will continue to seek out and call out anyone who uses and anyone who aids in 
 the use of chemical weapons 
 With yesterday ’s military action our message was crystal clear The United States 
 of America will not allow the Assad regime to continue to use chemical weapons 
 Last night we obliterated the major research facility that it used to assemble 
 weapons of mass murder I spoke to the President this morning and he said if the 
 Syrian regime uses this poison gas again the United States is locked and loaded 
 When our President draws a red line our President enforces the red line 
 The United States is deeply grateful to the United Kingdom and France for its part 
 in the coalition to defend the prohibition of chemical weapons We worked in lock 
 step we were in complete agreement Last night our great friends and 
 indispensable allies shouldered a burden that benefits all of us The civilized world 
 owes them its thanks In the weeks and months to come the Security Council 
 should take time to reflect on its role in defending the international rule of law 
 The Security Council has failed in its duty to hold those who use chemical weapons 
 to account That failure is largely due to Russian obstruction We call on Russia to 
 take a hard look at the company it keeps and live up to its responsibilities as a 
 Permanent Member of the Council and defend the actual principles the United 
 Nations was meant to promote 
 Last night we successfully hit the heart of Syria ’s chemical weapons enterprise 
 and because of these actions we are confident that we have crippled Syria ’s 
 chemical weapons program 
 We are prepared to sustain this pressure if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to 
 test our will

126,William Jefferson Clinton,State of the Union Address,1995," Mr. President Mr. Speaker Members of the 104th Congress my fellow Americans 
 Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again our democracy 
 has spoken So let me   of you here in the 104th 
 Congress and congratulating you Mr. Speaker 
 If we agree on nothing else tonight we must agree that the American people 
 certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994 And as I look out at you I know 
 how some of you must have felt in 1992 
 I must say that in both years we did n't hear America singing we heard America 
 shouting And now all of us Republicans and Democrats alike must say We hear 
 you We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us For we are the 
 keepers of a sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very 
 demanding era 
 Over 200 years ago our Founders changed the entire course of human history by 
 joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea We 
 hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal endowed by 
 their Creator with certain unalienable Rights and among these are Life Liberty 
 and the pursuit of Happiness 
 It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea the American 
 idea and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times to Lincoln 
 and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery to Theodore 
 Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the 
 industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to Franklin 
 Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our 
 country 's great struggle against fascism and to all our Presidents since to fight 
 the cold war Especially I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in 
 partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party to Harry 
 Truman who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the 
 architecture of the cold war and to Ronald Reagan whom we wish well tonight 
 and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism 
 was won 
 In another time of change and challenge I had the honor to be the first President 
 to be elected in the post cold war era an era   economy the 
 information revolution unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the 
 American people 
 I came to this hallowed Chamber two years ago on a mission to restore the 
 American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st 
 century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world I 
 was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored In this effort 
 I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes and I have learned again the 
 importance of humility in all human endeavor But I am also proud to say tonight 
 that our country is stronger than it was two years ago Thank you 
 Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy We are 
 at peace and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world We 
 have almost six million new jobs since I became President and we have the 
 lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years Our businesses 
 are more productive And here we have worked to bring the deficit down to 
 expand trade to put more police on our streets to give our citizens more of the 
 tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities 
 But the rising tide is not lifting all boats While our Nation is enjoying peace and 
 prosperity too many of our people are still working harder and harder for less 
 and less While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and 
 competitive too many of our people still ca n't be sure of having a job next year or 
 even next month And far more than our material riches are threatened things far 
 more precious to us our children our families our values 
 Our civil life is suffering in America today Citizens are working together less and 
 shouting at each other more The common bonds of community which have been 
 the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed What 
 are we to do about it 
 More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era President Roosevelt told 
 our Nation New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those 
 who conduct Government And from that simple proposition he shaped the New 
 Deal which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship 
 between our people and their Government for half a century 
 That approach worked in its time But we today we face a very different time and 
 very different conditions We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and 
 sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility Our 
 Government once a champion of national purpose is now   simply 
 a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens rather than 
 equipping them to get ahead The values that used to hold us all together seem to 
 be coming apart 
 So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this 
 time As we enter a new era we need a new set of understandings not just with 
 Government but even more important with one another as Americans 
 That 's what I want to talk with you about tonight I call it the New Covenant But 
 it 's grounded in a very very old idea that all Americans have not just a right but a 
 solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God given talents and determination 
 can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country 
 in return Opportunity and responsibility They go hand in hand We ca n't have one 
 without the other And our national community ca n't hold together without both 
 Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our 
 people to meet the challenges of a new economy how we can change the way our 
 Government works to fit a different time and above all how we can repair the 
 damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose We 
 must have dramatic change in our economy our Government and ourselves 
 My fellow Americans without regard to party let us rise to the occasion Let us 
 put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride As we embark on this new course 
 let us put our country first remembering that regardless of party label we are all 
 Americans And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one Is it good 
 for the American people 
 Let me   we can not ask Americans to be better citizens if we 
 are not better servants You made a good   law which applies 
 to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector and I was proud to sign it 
 yesterday But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things 
 work around here Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors 
 of Washington as were here 20 years ago The American people look at their 
 Capital and they see a city where the well connected and the well protected can 
 work the system but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out 
 As the new Congress opened its doors lobbyists were still doing business as 
 usual the gifts the trips all the things that people are concerned about have n't 
 stopped Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices I 
 know there were other considerations in those votes but I want to use something 
 that I 've heard my Republican friends say from time to time There does n't have 
 to be a law for everything So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists 
 perks Just stop We do n't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong 
 signal to the American people that things are really changing But I also hope you 
 will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill and I 'll sign that too 
 We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they 're 
 spending what they want We should also curb the role of big money in elections 
 by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC 's And as I 
 have said for 3 years we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an 
 instrument of democracy not a weapon of  TV time to 
 candidates for public office 
 When the last Congress killed political reform last year it was reported in the 
 press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and 
 cheered This year let 's give the folks at home something to cheer about 
 More important I think we all agree that we have to change the way the 
 Government works Let 's make it smaller less costly and smarter leaner not 
 meaner 
 I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well 
 The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic 
 way as the computer is from the manual typewriter The old way of governing 
 around here protected organized interests We should look out for the interests of 
 ordinary people The old way divided  or class The 
 New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what 's best for our 
 country The old way dispensed services through large top down inflexible 
 bureaucracies The New Covenant way should shift these resources and 
 decision making from bureaucrats to citizens injecting choice and competition 
 and individual responsibility into national policy The old way of governing around 
 here actually seemed to reward failure The New Covenant way should have 
 built in incentives to reward success The old way was centralized here in 
 Washington The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across 
 America And we should help them to do that 
 Our job here is to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to 
 make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at home and 
 abroad We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves We 
 should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for 
 each other 
 I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters we can go 
 beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a 
 program for every problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the 
 Government is a source of every problem we have Our job is to get rid of 
 yesterday 's Government so that our own people can meet today 's and tomorrow 's 
 needs And we ought to do it together 
 You know for years before I became President I heard others say they would cut 
 Government and how bad it was but not much happened We actually did it We 
 cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending more than 300 domestic 
 programs more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 
 two years alone Based on decisions already made we will have cut a total of more 
 than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government making it the 
 smallest it has been since John Kennedy was  I come here 
 again next year 
 Under the leadership of Vice President Gore our initiatives have already saved 
 taxpayers $ 63 billion The age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray you can break 
 on David Letterman is gone Deadwood programs like mohair subsidies are 
 gone We 've streamlined the Agriculture   by more than 
 1,200 offices We 've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a 
 single page We 've thrown away the Government 's 10,000 page personnel 
 manual 
 And the Government is working better in important ways FEMA the Federal 
 Emergency Management Agency has gone from being a disaster to helping people 
 in disasters You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood 
 there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and 
 fires and they 'll tell you that Government workers working hand in hand with 
 private business rebuilt southern California 's fractured freeways in record time 
 and under budget And because the Federal Government moved fast all but one of 
 the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business 
 Now there are a lot of other things that I could talk about I want to just mention 
 one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks University 
 administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and 
 weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program which 
 makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for 
 students costs the Government less and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for 
 the Government and for the universities We should n't cap that program We 
 should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it 
 Previous Government programs gathered dust The reinventing Government report 
 is getting results And we 're not through There 's going to be a second round of 
 reinventing Government We propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrinking 
 departments extending our freeze on domestic spending cutting 60 public 
 housing programs down to 3 getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need 
 like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program And 
 we 're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more 
 sensible The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should 
 go We have to cut yesterday 's Government to help solve tomorrow 's problems 
 And we need to get Government closer to the people it 's meant to serve We need 
 to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and 
 private citizens in the private sector can do a better job If they can do it we 
 ought to let them do it We should get out of the way and let them do what they 
 can do better Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to 
 communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for 
 It 's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we 
 make here in Washington I know there are still serious differences over the 
 details of the unfunded mandates legislation but I want to work with you to make 
 sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give 
 justified relief where we need to give it 
 For years Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects Last 
 year was no difference There was a $ 1 million to study stress in plants and $ 12 
 million for a tick removal program that did n't work It 's hard to remove ticks 
 Those of us who have had them know But I 'll tell you something if you 'll give me 
 line item veto I 'll remove some of that unnecessary spending 
 But I think we should all remember and almost all of us would agree that 
 Government still has important responsibilities Our young people we should 
 think of this when we cut our young people hold our future in their hands We 
 still owe a debt to our veterans And our senior citizens have made us what we 
 are Now my budget cuts a lot But it protects education veterans Social 
 Security and Medicare and I hope you will do the same thing You should and I 
 hope you will 
 And when we give more flexibility to the States let us remember that there are 
 certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State North 
 and South East and West Immunization against childhood disease school 
 lunches in all our schools Head Start medical care and nutrition for pregnant 
 women and infants all these things all these things are in the national interest 
 I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations But when 
 we deregulate let 's remember what national action in the national interest has 
 given us safer food for our families safer toys for our children safer nursing 
 homes for our parents safer cars and highways and safer workplaces cleaner air 
 and cleaner water Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations 
 You bet we do But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking 
 water We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it 
 Should we cut the deficit more Well of course we should Of course we should 
 But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and 
 does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be 
 helped 
 I know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment I 
 certainly want to balance the budget Our Administration has done more to bring 
 the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time If you 
 believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do then you have to be 
 straight with the American people They have a right to know what you 're going to 
 cut what taxes you 're going to raise and how it 's going to affect them We should 
 be doing things in the open around here For example everybody ought to know if 
 this proposal is going to endanger Social Security I would oppose that and I think 
 most Americans would 
 Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our 
 failed welfare system This is one of the problems we have to face here in 
 Washington in our New Covenant It rewards welfare over work It undermines 
 family values It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child 
 support 
 It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on 
 it for a very long time 
 I 've worked on this problem for a long time nearly 15 years now As a Governor I 
 had the honor of working with the Reagan Administration to write the last welfare 
 reform bill back in 1988 In the last two years we made a good start at continuing 
 the work of welfare reform Our Administration gave two dozen States the right to 
 slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems 
 and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency 
 Last year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by 
 an Administration We have to make welfare what it was meant to be a second 
 chance not a way of life We have to help those on welfare move to work as 
 quickly as possible to provide child care and teach them skills if that 's what they 
 need for up to two years And after that there ought to be a simple hard rule 
 Anyone who can work must go to work If a parent is n't paying child support they 
 should be forced to pay We should suspend drivers license track them across 
 State lines make them work off what they owe That is what we should do 
 Governments do not raise children people do And the parents must take 
 responsibility for the children they bring into this world 
 I want to work with you with all of you to pass welfare reform But our goal must 
 be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence from 
 welfare to work from mere childbearing to responsible parenting Our goal should 
 not be to punish them because they happen to be poor 
 We should we should require work and mutual responsibility But we should n't 
 cut people off just because they 're poor they 're young or even because they 're 
 unmarried We should promote   mothers to live at 
 home with their parents or in other supervised  to 
 finish school But we should n't put them and their children out on the street And I 
 know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about this for a 
 long time I still do n't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the 
 mistakes of their parents 
 My fellow Americans every single survey shows that all the American people care 
 about this without regard to party or race or region 
 So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it But also let this be the year 
 that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America No one is more 
 eager to end welfare I may be the only President who has actually had the 
 opportunity to sit in a welfare office who 's actually spent hours and hours talking 
 to people on welfare And I am telling you the people who are trapped on it know 
 it does n't work they also want to get off So we can promote together education 
 and work and good parenting I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or 
 the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent I just do n't want to 
 punish poverty and past mistakes All of us have made our mistakes and none of 
 us can change our yesterdays But every one of us can change our tomorrows And 
 America 's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey who worked her way off 
 welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California 
 I know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime as are all the 
 citizens of our country And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough 
 crime bill longer sentences three strikes and you 're out almost 60 new capital 
 punishment offenses more prisons more prevention 100,000 more police And 
 we paid for it   size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the 
 money back to local communities to lower the crime rate 
 There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime to be smarter with 
 crime to help to lower that rate first Well if there are let 's talk about them and 
 let 's do them But let 's not go back on the things that we did last year that we 
 know work that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us 
 that we did the right thing because local community leaders who have worked for 
 years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work Let 's look at the 
 experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down 
 and ask the people who did it how they did it And if what we did last year 
 supports the decline in the crime rate and I am convinced that it does let us 
 not go back on it Let 's stick with it implement it We 've got 4 more hard years of 
 work to do to do that 
 I do n't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight 
 but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year The last 
 Congress also passed the Brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on 19 assault 
 weapons I do n't think it 's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members 
 of the last Congress who voted for that are n't here tonight because they voted for 
 it And I know therefore that some of you who are here because they voted for it 
 are under enormous pressure to repeal it I just have to tell you how I feel about 
 it 
 The Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to 
 infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other 
 appropriate sporting activities I 've done it since I was a boy and I 'm going to 
 keep right on doing it until I ca n't do it anymore But a lot of people laid down 
 their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids would n't have to lay down 
 their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack and I will not let that be 
 repealed I will not let it be repealed 
 I 'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with I want us to 
 cut more spending but I hope we wo n't cut Government programs that help to 
 prepare us for the new economy promote responsibility and are organized from 
 the grassroots up   The very best example of this is the 
 national service corps AmeriCorps It passed with strong bipartisan support And 
 now there are 20,000 Americans more than ever served in one year in the Peace 
 Corps working all over this country helping people person to person in local 
 grassroots volunteer groups solving problems and in the process earning some 
 money for their education This is citizenship at its best It 's good for the 
 AmeriCorps members but it 's good for the rest of us too It 's the essence of the 
 New Covenant and we should n't stop it 
 All Americans not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in 
 this country are rightly   numbers of illegal aliens entering 
 our country The jobs they hold might otherwise be   legal 
 immigrants The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers That 's 
 why our Administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by 
 hiring a record number of new border  as many criminal 
 aliens as ever  on illegal  
 benefits to illegal aliens In the budget I will present to you we will try to do more 
 to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better 
 identify illegal aliens in the workplace as   headed 
 by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan We are a nation of immigrants But we 
 are also a nation of laws It is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of 
 immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in 
 recent years and we must do more to stop it 
 The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the 
 American people to succeed in the global economy America has always been a 
 land of opportunity a land where if you work hard you can get ahead We 've 
 become a great middle class country Middle class values sustain us We must 
 expand that middle class and shrink the under class even as we do everything we 
 can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new 
 economy 
 America is once again the world 's strongest economic power almost 6 million new 
 jobs in the last two years exports booming inflation down High wage jobs are 
 coming back A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American 
 dream If we want it to stay that way those who work and lift our Nation must 
 have more of its benefits 
 Today too many of those people are being left out They 're working harder for 
 less They have less security less income less certainty that they can even afford 
 a vacation much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves We 
 can not let this continue If we do n't act our economy will probably keep doing 
 what it 's been doing since about 1978 when the income growth began to go to 
 those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got 
 very little growth and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then 
 fell even further and further behind in the years afterward no matter how hard 
 they worked 
 We 've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new 
 economy work for all of our people a Government that helps each and every one 
 of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills That 's 
 why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last two 
 years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for young people who 
 do n't go to college to making college loans more available and more affordable 
 That 's the first thing we have to do We 've got to do something to empower people 
 to improve their skills 
 The second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately 
 by lowering their taxes We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax 
 cut for 15 million families with incomes under $ 27,000 a tax cut that this year will 
 average about $ 1,000 a family And we also gave tax reductions to most small and 
 new businesses Before we could do more than that we first had to bring down 
 the deficit we inherited and we had to get economic growth up Now we 've done 
 both And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way But tax cuts should 
 reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizens through 
 education and training to make the most of their own lives The spotlight should 
 shine on those who make the right choices for themselves their families and their 
 communities 
 I have proposed the middle class bill of rights which should properly be called the 
 bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are 
 working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves It will 
 therefore give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the 
 long run in a way that benefits all of us 
 There are four provisions First a tax deduction for all education and training after 
 high school If you think about it we permit businesses to deduct their 
 investment we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages but 
 today an education is even more important to the economic well being of our 
 whole country than even those things are We should do everything we can to 
 encourage it And I hope you will support it Second we ought to cut taxes $ 500 
 for families with children under 13 Third we ought to foster more savings and 
 personal   to establish an individual retirement 
 account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education health care 
 first time homebuying or the care of a parent And fourth we should pass a GI 
 bill for America 's workers We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs 
 and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American 
 people offer vouchers to them so that they if they 're laid off or if they 're working 
 for a very low wage can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to two years to 
 go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills 
 they need to improve their lives Let 's empower people in this way move it from 
 the Government directly to the workers of America 
 Now any one of us can call for a tax cut but I wo n't accept one that explodes the 
 deficit or puts our recovery at risk We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and 
 honestly 
 Just two years ago it was an open question whether we would find the strength to 
 cut the deficit Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then many of 
 whom did n't return we did cut the deficit We began to do what others said would 
 not be done We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion about $ 10,000 for every 
 family in this country It 's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since 
 Mr. Truman was President and I do n't think anybody in America wants us to let it 
 explode again 
 In the budget I will send you the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by 
 budget cuts in bureaucracy cuts in programs cuts in special interest subsidies 
 And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts My budget pays for the 
 middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare And I will oppose any 
 attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts That 's not the right thing to do 
 I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief and some of them I 
 find quite interesting I really want to work with all of you My test for our 
 proposals will be Will it create jobs and raise incomes will it strengthen our 
 families and support our children is it paid for will it build the middle class and 
 shrink the under class If it does I 'll support it But if it does n't I wo n't 
 The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the under class is also why I 
 believe that you should raise the minimum wage It rewards work Two and a half 
 million Americans two and a half million Americans often women with children 
 are working out there today for $ 4.25 an hour In terms of real buying power by 
 next year that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low That 's not my idea of how 
 the new economy ought to work 
 Now I 've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum 
 wage increase I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does 
 not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market But the most 
 important thing is you ca n't make a living on $ 4.25 an hour especially if you have 
 children even with the working families tax cut we passed last year In the past 
 the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it should be again So I 
 want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this to get together to find a 
 way to make the minimum wage a living wage 
 Members of Congress have been here less than a month   of the 
 week 28 days into the new year every Member of Congress will have earned as 
 much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long 
 Everybody else here including the President has something else that too many 
 Americans do without and that 's health care Now last year we almost came to 
 blows over health care but we did n't do anything And the cold hard fact is that 
 since last year since I was here another 1.1 million Americans in working families 
 have lost their health care And the cold hard fact is that many millions more 
 most of them farmers and small business people and self employed people have 
 seen their premiums skyrocket their copays and deductibles go up There 's a 
 whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance 
 but really what they 've got is a piece of paper that says they wo n't lose their home 
 if they get sick 
 Now I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security 
 for every American family But I know that last year as the evidence indicates we 
 bit off more than we could chew So I 'm asking you that we work together Let 's 
 do it  's do whatever we have to do to get something done Let 's at 
 least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage 
 for facing skyrocketing prices that nobody loses their coverage because they face 
 high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a 
 family member gets sick 
 I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this with the 
 Democrats who worked on it last time with the Republican leaders like Senator 
 Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some 
 constructive proposals in this area last year We ought to make sure that 
 self employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable 
 rates through voluntary purchasing pools We ought to help families provide 
 long term care for a sick parent or a disabled child We can work to help workers 
 who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while 
 they look for work And we can find a way it may take some time but we can 
 find a way to make sure that our children have health care 
 You know I think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of 
 the fact that our country was rated as having the world 's most productive 
 economy for the first time in nearly a decade But we ca n't be proud of the fact 
 that we 're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of 
 the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years 
 ago the last time we were the most productive economy in the world So let 's 
 work together on this It is too important for politics as usual 
 Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we 've 
 already talked about A lot of people think that the security concerns of America 
 today are entirely internal to our borders They relate to the security of our jobs 
 and our homes and our incomes and our children our streets our health and 
 protecting those borders Now that the cold war has passed it 's tempting to 
 believe that all the security issues with the possible exception of trade reside 
 here at home But it 's not so Our security still depends upon our continued world 
 leadership for peace and freedom and democracy We still ca n't be strong at home 
 unless we 're strong abroad 
 The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point I know it 's not popular to say it 
 tonight but we have to act not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the 
 millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico 's wellbeing If we want 
 to secure American jobs preserve American exports safeguard America 's borders 
 then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track 
 Now let me repeat It 's not a loan It 's not foreign aid It 's not a bailout We will 
 be given a guarantee like cosigning a note with good collateral that will cover our 
 risks This legislation is the right thing for America That 's why the bipartisan 
 leadership has supported it And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly It is in 
 our interest and we can explain it to the American people because we 're going to 
 do it in the right way 
 You know tonight this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since 
 the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the 
 children of America And along with the Russians we 're on our way to destroying 
 the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads We 've come so 
 far so fast in this post cold war world that it 's easy to take the decline of the 
 nuclear threat for granted But it 's still there and we are n't finished yet 
 This year I 'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 
 5,000 more warheads The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely 
 the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban 
 and to eliminate chemical weapons To stop and roll back North Korea 's potentially 
 deadly nuclear program we 'll continue to implement the agreement we have 
 reached with that nation It 's smart It 's tough It 's a deal based on continuing 
 inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves 
 This year I 'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand 
 in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad As the cowards 
 who bombed the World Trade Center found out this country will hunt down 
 terrorists and bring them to justice 
 Just this week another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured 
 scores more On behalf of the American people and all of you I send our deepest 
 sympathy to the families of the victims I know that in the face of such evil it is 
 hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward But the terrorists represent 
 the past not the future We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace 
 between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East 
 Accordingly last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the 
 United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process 
 It prohibits financial transactions with these groups And tonight I call on all our 
 allies and peace loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed 
 fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism We can not permit the future to be 

 From the day I took the oath of office I pledged that our Nation would maintain 
 the best equipped best trained and best prepared military on Earth We have and 
 they are They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold 
 war with remarkable skill and spirit But to make sure our military is ready for 
 action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families 
 deserve I 'm asking the Congress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the 
 next six years 
 I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became 
 President Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction We ask a very 
 great deal of our Armed Forces Now that they are smaller in number we ask more 
 of them They go out more often to more different places and stay longer They are 
 called to service in many many ways And we must give them and their families 
 what the times demand and what they have earned 
 Just think about what our troops have done in the last year showing America at 
 its best helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda moving with 
 lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait giving freedom and 
 democracy back to the people of Haiti We have proudly supported peace and 
 prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland from Central and 
 Eastern Europe to Asia from Latin America to the Middle East All these endeavors 
 are good in those places but they make our future more confident and more 
 secure 
 Well my fellow Americans that 's my agenda for America 's future expanding 
 opportunity not bureaucracy enhancing security at home and abroad 
 empowering our people to make the most of their own lives It 's ambitious and 
 achievable but it 's not enough We even need more than new ideas for changing 
 the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy more than a 
 Government that 's smaller smarter and wiser more than all of the changes we 
 can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in 
 Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some 
 questions from within from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well 
 as our heads voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for 
 ourselves and our families for our communities and yes for our fellow citizens 
 We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart and 
 we feel the common ground shifting from under us The PTA the town hall 
 meeting the ball park it 's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time 
 and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation Too 
 many of our children do n't even have parents and grandparents who can give 
 them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their 
 sense of identity 
 We all know that while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those 
 things that the real differences will be   citizens where they 
 work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party 
 When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter 's 
 league and people would come up to me fathers and mothers and talk to me I 
 can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or 
 Democrats When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California northern 
 California last week a woman came up to me and did something that very few of 
 you would do She hugged me and said Mr. President I 'm a Republican but I 'm 
 glad you 're here 
 Now why We ca n't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day 
 because as we move into this next century everybody matters We do n't have a 
 person to waste And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better That 
 means that we need a New Covenant for everybody 
 For our corporate and business leaders we 're going to work here to keep bringing 
 the deficit down to expand markets to support their success in every possible 
 way But they have an obligation when they 're doing well to keep jobs in our 
 communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate 
 For people in the entertainment industry in this country we applaud your 
 creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of 
 expression But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and 
 to understand the damage that comes from the incessant repetitive mindless 
 violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time 
 We 've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us 
 stop our most serious social problem the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births 
 where there is no marriage I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all 
 over this country with anti pregnancy programs that work But Government can 
 only do so much Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to 
 join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference 
 We can do this and we must 
 And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders You know I 'm 
 proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than 
 any country in the world These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite 
 their congregations to carry their faith into action can reach out to all of our 
 children to all of the people in distress to those who have been savaged by the 
 breakdown of all we hold dear Because so much of what must be done must come 
 from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all 
 the difference they have a role in the New Covenant as well 
 There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens You know it takes a lot of 
 people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school It takes a 
 lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates 
 on his lapel pin It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the 
 civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to 
 most of us when we were kids It takes every parent to teach the children the 
 difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and 
 to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they 
 want to be 
 I know it 's hard when you 're working harder for less when you 're under great 
 stress to do these things A lot of our people do n't have the time or the emotional 
 stress they think to do the work of citizenship 
 Most of us in politics have n't helped very much For years we 've mostly treated 
 citizens like they were consumers or spectators sort of political couch potatoes 
 who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for 
 nothing or play on their fears and frustrations And more and more of our citizens 
 now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are 
 hardly conducive to honest and open conversations But the truth is we have got 
 to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views 
 If you go back to the beginning of this country the great strength of America as 
 de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago has always been 
 our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work 
 together to find common ground And in this day everybody has a responsibility to 
 do more of that We simply can not want for a tornado a fire or a flood to behave 
 like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another 
 I want to finish up   some folks that are up with the First Lady 
 that represent what I 'm trying to talk about citizens I have no idea what their 
 party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election But they represent 
 what we ought to be doing 
 Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky She 
 gains when she gives She 's a mother of four She says that her service inspired 
 her to get her high school equivalency last year She was married when she was a 
 teenager stand up Cindy She was married when she was a teenager She had 
 four children But she had time to serve other people to get her high school 
 equivalency and she 's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college 
 Chief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City He 's been a national leader 
 stand up Steve He 's been a national leader in using more police in community 
 policing and he 's worked with AmeriCorps to do it And the crime rate in Kansas 
 City has gone down as a result of what he did 
 Corporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country 's force to 
 help secure democracy in his native land And I might add we must be the only 
 country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian Americans 
 there who could speak the language and talk to the people And he was one of 
 them and we 're proud of him 
 The next two folks I 've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit 
 the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion Church in 
 Temple Hills Maryland I 'd like to ask them to stand I want to tell you about 
 them In the early eighties they left Government service and formed a church in a 
 small living room in a small house in the early eighties Today that church has 
 17,000 members It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire 
 United States It grows by 200 a month They do it together And the special focus 
 of their ministry is keeping families together 
 Two things they did make a big impression on me I visited their church once and 
 I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington DC line in 
 a higher crime higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their 
 ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them The second thing I 
 want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House 
 with some other religious leaders and he left early to go back to this church to 
 minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over 
 America to convince them to come back together to save their marriages and to 
 raise their kids This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America We 
 need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported 
 The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg Mississippi 
 Jack would you stand up Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo Jima Jack Lucas 
 taught and learned the lessons of citizenship On February 20th 1945 he and 
 three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet Jack 
 Lucas threw himself on both of them In that moment he saved the lives of his 
 companions and miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life He 
 gained a foothold for freedom and at the age of 17 just a year older than his 
 grandson who is up there with him today and his son who is a West Point 
 graduate and a veteran at 17 Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history 
 and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor 
 All these years later yesterday here 's what he said about that day It did n't 
 matter where you were from or who you were you relied on one another You did 
 it for your country 
 We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow That 's at the heart of this 
 New Covenant Responsibility opportunity and citizenship more than stale 
 chapters in some remote civic book they 're still the   can fulfill 
 ourselves and reach our God given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the 
 eternal promise of this country the enduring dream from that first and most 
 sacred covenant I believe every person in this country still believes that we are 
 created equal and   the right to life liberty and the pursuit of 
 happiness This is a very very great country And our best days are still to come

127,Attallah Shabazz,Remarks at the Funeral Service for Coretta Scott King,2006," It 's a big one to balance for a lot of reasons First I have to say praise God 
 Almighty that we have been bestowed with such a woman as Coretta Scott King 
 that for me my family my five younger sisters that our hearts are heavy but 
 the memory brings on a chuckle and a smile and a caress of warmth because of 
 the role she played in our individual lives after we lost are own mother 
 Now on the sixth day of Creation we all know that God created Man in His image 
 But even God knew His work was not done until he created Woman bless His 
 heart How many of you here know that no matter how mighty the man in your 
 midst is that he could not do it without the caress the wink the unconditional 
 love the pat on the back the sustenance the maintenance of the woman in his 
 life 
 As I sat there I looked around and realized how full the room is probably the 
 viewing audience and those who can not touch this room or cable television or 
 read a newspaper for whom Coretta mattered Yes indeed Martin Luther King 
 Jr. But Coretta Scott King gave people a backbone and a poise If you did n't have 
 any of your own you could mimic it at least You knew what grace looked like You 
 knew what poise looked like And in her it came in brown which we did n't always 
 get to see forecast before us We got to see it in wonderment and beauty just that 
 film You know was she never not cute I mean just lovely just just lovely 
 The nostalgia that I see around with silvering members of the civil rights 
 movement marchers spokespersons having hit it hard and recovered and 
 sustained Let me acknowledge one who has not been We 've had the grace of 
 meeting Mrs. Oliver Tambo.¹ We know Dr. Height We 've heard from the illustrious 
 Dr. Angelou Mothers of the movement sustainers of the movement But one of 
 the mothers who had to live with the same similar thing as my mother and Mrs. 
 King was Mrs. Merle Evers.² These are women who when no one was looking 
 they had to maintain sustain and they had each other 
 I want to thank the King family for asking me to speak on behalf of my family You 
 know decades ago one would not think that there was any likeness between 
 Malcolm X Shabazz and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. So our families are n't 
 united because of something we 've done today It was united because those men 
 started it then unbenounced to many Have you ever seen the picture of the two 
 of them embraced and with a grin this wide 
 They knew what they stood for No matter how different the message was the 
 same It was to make sure that we as a people in the United States on this globe 
 were inherent beneficiaries of what God had bestowed to all of us at birth 
 However the means there are arteries plentiful to meet that heart 
 A few decades later in the 70 's through the introduction of a a journalist and 
 photographer in Ebony Magazine I got to meet the eldest daughter People were 
 surprised   had not already been an integral part of each other 's 
 lives But I want to say in our respective households we were sibling families if 
 I 'm clear all the while in this together wondering what was going on in the 
 threshold of the other house feeling one another 
 So there was a little apprehension Hope she likes me She thought the same 
 Stood in front of a planned posed photographer whom we both grew up knowing 
 Moneta Sleet That was the easy part We hummed and tapped our foot And he 
 said loosen up a little You know break a little bread 
 Then we just started to realize certain things Not only were we the oldest 
 daughters of our respective families but our birthdays were a day apart Could 
 that be fate We knew we had commonalities We knew our parents did Realized 
 that makes us both Scorpio Uh oh Then Moneta Sleet took a picture with tonsils 
 and wide tongues wide mouths and that was how the friendship and kinship 
 began with Yolanda King and myself 
 Shortly thereafter we founded a national touring company called Nucleus 
 which brought us together on a regular basis Started with four shows of 
 presentations and it went up to 16 cities a year And for 14 years we were on the 
 road meeting people who were n't ready They did n't think it could be They even 
 thought that they could pull one against the  know the 
 Malcolmites with give you the whatever and the Kingites would [gestures 
 accordingly But you wanted to say No We 're in this together That 's why were 
 standing together both of us respectively products of our our households no 
 doubt We look like our household parents We She had that ya'll and that 
 easiness of the South which I just loved Tee hee And mine was quick northern 
 and West Indian Product of my house 
 And we traveled around just enabling people to see that you can merge We could 
 still be exactly who we were and function together be together make this thing 
 happen together I was n't flattered when one picked Malcolm over Martin I was 
 protective of who he was through her And vice versa You 're not doing the men 
 any   You 're not doing us any justice by 
 picking one over the other There are many methods for us to get to this union of 
 who we were 
 Our mothers beautiful women And I 'd like to say Mayor Franklin that maybe 
 my mother can have a honorary seat on that Freedom Choir When I came home 
 after meeting Yolanda King my mother sat with bated breath wondering how it 
 would all go as if it she were a long lost daughter of her own So as we traveled 
 on the road together we got to swap mothers all of us as I got to know the 
 King siblings and feel like their older sibling myself Very protective I am of each 
 of you in my heart 
 They were definitely sisters My mother Mrs. Coretta Scott King and Merely Evers 
 would go away for retreats unbenounced to people pin curls Noxzema and 
 share that which others could not And when you saw any of them grace followed 
 but not without a Keloid under the attire not without a continuous rub of Aloe 
 Vera coconut oil a little sag But the commitment to the mission to loving their 
 husbands to raising their children sustained them Excuse me 
 When my mother in 1997 had her accident the gathering of women surrounded 
 us I see many of them here Mrs. King was no doubt a part of that perpetual 
 momentum When my mother made her transition Mrs. King was one of the few 
 who maintained regular phone calls Now I had always called and exchanged cards 
 and things on significant dates not the Monday that celebrated her husband 's 
 birthday but on exactly January 15th because there 's an intimate association But 
 on birthdays And we would always get all six of my mother 's children would 
 receive something in the mail every birthday 
 This past November I got a package in the mail Now we all know that she was 
 wheelchair bound We knew that she did n't speak so it meant that our 
 conversations where cut out But I could send a note I just did n't expect notes 
 back It was n't the burden she needed to bear So I get a package and I get a card 
 It was for my birthday A mother all the while Do you understand what I 'm 
 saying Certainly a mother of the Movement but intimately in terms of the 
 dedication And it 's signed from her with the hand writing of her daughter 
 Bernice 
 As I continued to travel I sent cards again just so that she can hear from me 
 Every time I sent a card I 'd get a call from one of the children saying well more 
 specifically yeah okay Mother wants to hear your voice And I 'd get it on the 
 you know too far to call back immediately And I 'm trying not to put pressure 
 And then I 'd get another call with a tap of the foot and the sound I do n't know 
 did you get my message And I know it 's not just her pounding it 's mother 
 pounding And my heart if you can talk about intuition was was almost too 
 scared to touch Because I was n't ready 
 Excuse me I 'm sorry 
 Yet no doubt one of the most beautiful things as her eldest daughter and I 
 discussed when you witness love and being loved the way we 
 respectable mothers you almost feel like you do n't have the right to ask them to 
 stay a day longer when they are now in the arms of He who loved her most For it 
 is not fair to rob someone of that Because if she was here we 'd still be on the 
 receiving end But from a chair and quietly silent the reflection and I know He 
 reached down caressing her and saying I 'm here all the while Sometimes just 
 the human being needs simply that 
 I 'd like to read a phrase form Khalil Gibran that I lifted on death Now I 
 myself do n't use the term death but transition And he says 
 What is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides that it may 
 rise and expand and seek God unencumbered 
 Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing 
 And when you have reached the mountaintop only then shall you begin to climb 
 And when the earth shall claim your limbs only then shall you truly dance 
 Trust the dreams for in them is hidden the gate to eternity 
 So as we have all have grown up though this civil rights movement some before 
 and we know that anthem hymn We Shall Overcome I 'd like to presume to 
 add an update of affirmation not the some day but to day Time 's up 
 We have lost many on that walk on that journey who stood steadfast steadfast 
 giving and doing serving and being sharing and extending And I would rather 
 say something like We have come over to day We have achieved today Even

 National Native American Affirmative Image Committee 
 I ’m representing Marlin Brando this evening and he has asked me to tell you in a 
 very long speech which I can not share with you presently because of time but I 
 will be glad to share with the press afterwards that he very regretfully can not 
 accept this very generous award 
 And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the 
 film industry excuse me and on television in movie re runs and also with 
 recent happenings at Wounded Knee 
 I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening and that we will in 
 the future our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and generosity

129,Binyamin Netanyahu,First Speech to a Joint Session of Congress,1996," If I could only get the Knesset to vote like this 
 Mr. Speaker Mr. Vice President members of Congress 
 This is not the first time that a Prime Minister of Israel addresses a joint meeting 
 of Congress My immediate predecessor Shimon Peres addressed this body and 
 before him the late Yitzhak Rabin who was tragically cut 
 savage assassin We are grateful that Israeli democracy has proved resilient 
 enough to overcome this barbaric act but we shall always carry with us the pain 
 of this tragedy 
 I recognize Mr. Speaker that the great honor you have bestowed on me is not 
 personal It is a tribute to the unshakable fact that the unique relationship 
 between Israel and the United States transcends politics and parties governments 
 and diplomacy It is a relationship between two peoples who share a total 
 commitment to the spirit of democracy and infinite dedication to freedom 
 We have a common vision of how societies should be governed of how civilization 
 should be advanced We both believe in eternal values we both believe in the 
 Almighty We both follow traditions   experience 
 We admire America not only for its dynamism and for its power and for its 
 wealth We admire America for its moral force As Jews and as Israelis we are 
 proud that this moral force is derived from the Bible and the precepts of morality 
 that the Jewish people have given the world 
 Of course Israel and the United States also have common interests But our bonds 
 go well beyond such interests In the 19th century citizens of all free states 
 viewed France as the great guardian of liberty In the 20th century every free 
 person looks to America as the champion of freedom 
 Yesterday my wife and I spent a very moving hour at Arlington Cemetery and we 
 saw there the evidence of the price you paid for that freedom in the lives of your 
 best and brightest young men And it 's a toll that is exacted from you from all of 
 us but from you these very days 
 I think it was the terrible misfortune of the Jewish people that in the first half of 
 this century the United States had not yet assumed its pivotal role in the world 
 And it has been our great fortune that in the second half of this century with the 
 miraculous renewal of Jewish nationhood the United States became the 
 preeminent power in the world 
 You the people of America offered the fledgling Jewish state succor and support 
 You   and time again against the forces of tyranny and 
 totalitarianism I know that I speak for every Israeli and every Jew throughout the 
 world when I say to you today Thank you people of America 
 Perhaps our most demanding joint effort has been the endless quest to achieve 
 peace and stability for Israel and its Arab neighbors American presidents have 
 joined successive Israeli governments in an untiring effort to attain this peace 
 The first historic breakthrough was   Begin and Presidents 
 Carter and Sadat at Camp David The most recent success was our pact with 
 Jordan under the auspices of President Clinton These efforts I believe are clear 
 proof of our intentions and our direction We want peace We want peace with all 
 our neighbors We have no quarrel with them which can not be resolved by 
 peaceful means Nor I must say do we have a quarrel with Islam We reject the 
 thesis of an inevitable clash of civilizations We do not subscribe to the idea that 
 Islam has replaced Communism as the new rival of the West because our conflict 
 is specific It is with those militant fanatics who pervert the central tenets of a 
 great faith towards violence and world domination Our hand is stretched in peace 
 to all who would grasp it We do n't care about their religion We do n't care about 
 their national identity We do n't care about their ideological belief We care about 
 peace and our hand is stretched out to peace 
 Every Israeli wants peace I do n't think there is a people who has yearned prayed 
 and sacrificed more for peace than we have There is not a family in Israel that has 
 not suffered the unbearable agony of war and directly or indirectly the 
 excruciating ever lasting pain of grief The mandate we have received from the 
 people of Israel is to continue the search for an end to wars and an end to grief I 
 promise you We are going to live up to this mandate We will continue the quest 
 for peace and to this end we are ready to resume negotiations with the 
 Palestinian Authority on the implementation of our Interim Agreement 
 I want to say something about agreements Some of you speak Latin or at least 
 studied Latin Pacta sunt servanta we believe agreements are made to be kept 
 This is our policy and we expect the Palestinian side to 
 On this basis we will be prepared to begin final status negotiations as well We 
 are ready to engage Syria and Lebanon in meaningful negotiations We seek to 
 broaden the circle of peace to the whole Arab world and the rest of the countries 
 of the Middle East 
 But I want to make it clear that we want a peace that will last We must have a 
 peace based on security for all We can not and I might say we dare not forget 
 that more men women and children have lost their lives to terrorist attacks in the 
 last three years than in the entire previous decade 
 I know that the representatives of the United States sitting here the people of the 
 United States are now becoming tragically familiar with this experience You 've 
 experienced it in places as far afield as New York 's World Trade Center and most 
 recently in Dhahran And I notice also the recent torching of Afro American 
 churches in America which I must tell you strike a familiar chilling note among 
 Jews 
 But I want to try and put the Israeli experience in perspective One has to 
 imagine to do so such attacks occurring time and time again in every city and in 
 every corner of this great country 
 So what we are saying here today is as simple as it is elementary Peace means 
 the absence of violence Peace means not fearing for your children every time they 
 board a bus Peace means walking the streets of your town without the fearful 
 shriek of Katyusha rockets overhead 
 We just visited with the wife of a friend of mine the deputy mayor of Kiryat 
 Shmona who was walking the streets of Kiryat Shmona when the fearful shriek of 
 a rocket over her head burned her car nearly burned her and she was 
 miraculously saved and she is alive and she is getting better But peace means 
 that this does n't happen because peace without personal safety is a contradiction 
 in terms It is a hoax It will not stand 
 What we are facing in the Middle East today is a broad front of terror throughout 
 the area Its common goal is to remove any Western and primarily any American 
 presence in the Middle East It seeks to break our will to shatter our resolve to 
 make us yield 
 I believe the terrorists must understand that we will not yield however grave and 
 fearful the challenge Neither Israel nor any other democracy and certainly not 
 the United States must ever bend to terrorism We must fight it resolutely 
 endlessly tirelessly we must fight it together until we remove this malignancy 
 from the face of the earth 
 For too long the standards of peace used throughout the world have not been 
 applied to the Middle East Violence and despotism have been excused and not 
 challenged Respect for human freedoms has not been on the agenda It 's been on 
 the agenda everywhere else Everywhere else in Latin America in the former 
 Soviet Union in South Africa and that effort has been 
 administrations 
 I think it 's time to demand a peace based on norms and standards It is not 
 enough to talk about peace in abstraction We must talk about the content of 
 peace It is time I believe for a code of conduct for building a lasting Middle East 
 peace 
 Such a peace must be based on three pillars the three pillars of peace 
 Security is the first pillar There is no substitute for it To succeed the quest for 
 peace must be   for security 
 Demanding an end to terrorist attacks as a prerequisite for peace does not give 
 the terrorists veto power over the peace process Because nearly all of the 
 terrorist acts directed against us are   whose 
 activities can be curbed if not altogether  partners 
 This means that our negotiating partners and indeed all the regimes of the region 
 must make a strategic choice either follow the option of terror as an instrument 
 of policy of diplomacy or follow the option of peace They can not have it both 
 ways 
 This choice means that the Palestinian Authority must live up to the obligations it 
 has solemnly undertaken to prevent terrorist attacks against Israel This choice 
 also means that Syria must cease its policy of enabling proxy attacks against 
 Israeli cities and undertake to eliminate threats from Hezbollah and other 
 Syrian based groups This means that the fight against terror can not be episodic 
 It can not be conditional It can not be whimsical It can not be optional It must 
 become the mainstay of a relationship of trust between Israel and its Arab 
 partners 
 The second pillar of peace is reciprocity This means an unshakable commitment to 
 the peaceful resolution of disputes including the border disputes between Israel 
 and its neighbors 
 The signing of a peace treaty should be the beginning of a relationship of 
 reciprocal respect recognition and the fulfillment of mutual obligations It should 
 not trigger round after round of hostile diplomacy Peace should not be the pursuit 
 of   A peace without pacification a peace without 
 normalization a peace in which Israel is repeatedly brought under attack is not a 
 true peace 
 Reciprocity means that every line in every agreement turns into a sinew of 
 reconciliation Reciprocity means that an agreement must be 
 Reciprocity is the glue of mutual commitments that upholds agreements This is 
 the second pillar of peace 
 The third pillar of lasting peace is democracy and human rights I am not revealing 
 a secret to the members of this chamber when I say that modern democracies do 
 not initiate aggression This has been the central lesson of the twentieth century 
 States that respect the human rights of their citizens are not likely to provoke 
 hostile action against their neighbors No one knows better than the United States 
 the world 's greatest democracy that the best guarantor against military 
 adventurism is accountable democratic government 
 The world has witnessed the bitter results of policies without standards in the 
 case of Saddam Hussein Unless we want more Saddams to rise we must apply 
 the standards of democracy and human rights in the Middle East I believe that 
 every Muslim and every Christian and every Jew in the region is entitled to nothing 
 less I do n't think we should accept the idea that the Middle East is the latest or 
 the last isolated sanctuary that will be democracy free for all time except for the 
 presence of Israel 
 I realize that this is a process It may be a long term process But I think we 
 should begin it It is time for the states of the Middle East to put the issues of 
 human rights and democratization on their agenda Democratization means 
 accepting a free press and the right of a legal opposition to organize and express 
 itself It 's very important for the opposition to be able to express itself Mr. 
 Speaker I 've just learned and will accord that same right as you know This is 
 democracy To be able to disagree to express our disagreements and sometimes 
 to agree after disagreements It means tolerance And it means an inherent shift 
 away from aggression toward the recognition of the mutual right to differ 
 I 'll admit the Middle East as a whole has not yet effected this basic shift this 
 change from autocracy to democracy But this does not mean that we can not have 
 peace in this region peace with non democratic regimes I believe we can It 's a 
 fact that we 've had such peace arrangements 
 But such peace arrangements as we can now arrive at can only be characterized 
 as a defensible peace in which we must retain assets essential to the defense of 
 our country and sufficient to deter aggression 
 Until this democratization becomes a mainstay of the region the proper course for 
 the democratic world   States is to strengthen the only 
 democracy in the Middle East Israel and to encourage moves to pluralism and 
 greater freedom in the Arab world 
 I want to make something clear We do not want peace merely in our time We 
 want peace for all time To the members of Peace Now we do not just want 
 peace now We want peace now and later we want peace for generations There 
 is no divide That desire is heartfelt It should be a point of unity not of disunity 
 This is why we must make the pursuit of human rights and democracy a 
 cornerstone of our quest 
 These then are the three pillars of peace peace reciprocity and the 
 strengthening of democracy 
 I believe that a peace based on these three pillars can be advanced Yet I ladies 
 and gentlemen would be remiss if I did not refer to a major challenge facing all of 
 us 
 I have touched on the problem of the Middle East that is largely undemocratic and 
 part of it is strongly anti democratic Specifically it is being radicalized and 
  of unreconstructed dictatorships whose governmental 
 creed is based on tyranny and intimidation 
 The most dangerous of these regimes is Iran that has we d a cruel despotism to a 
 fanatic militancy If this regime or its despotic neighbor Iraq were to acquire 
 nuclear weapons this could presage catastrophic consequences not only for my 
 country and not only for the Middle East but for all mankind 
 I believe the international community must reinvigorate its efforts to isolate these 
 regimes and prevent them from acquiring atomic power The United States and 
 Israel have been at the forefront of this effort but we can and must do much 
 more Europe and the countries of Asia must be made to understand that it is folly 
 nothing short of folly to pursue short time material gain while creating a 
 long term existential danger for all of us 
 Only the United States can lead this vital international effort to stop the 
 nuclearization of terrorist states But the deadline for attaining this goal is getting 
 extremely close 
 In our own generation we have witnessed how the United States averted by its 
 wisdom tenacity and determination the dangerous expansion of a totalitarian 
 superpower equipped with nuclear weapons The policy it used for that purpose 
 was deterrence Now we see the rise of a similar threat similar and in many 
 ways more dangerous against which 
 Deterrence must now be reinforced with prevention immediate and effective 
 prevention 
 We are confident that America once again will not fail to take the lead in 
 protecting our free civilization from this ultimate horror But ladies and 
 gentlemen time is running out We have to act responsibly in a united front 
 internationally This is not a slogan This is not over dramatization This is the life 
 of our children and our grandchildren And I believe there is no greater more 
 noble more responsible force than the united front of democracy led by the 
 world 's greatest democracy the United States We can overcome this challenge 
 We can beat it successfully 
 Let me now say a word about a subject that has been on your mind and ours and 
 that subject is the city of Jerusalem 
 Countless words have been written about that city on the hill which represents 
 the universal hope for justice and peace I live in that city on the hill And in my 
 boyhood I knew that city when it was divided into enemy camps with coils of 
 barbed wire stretched through its heart 
 Since 1967 under Israeli sovereignty united Jerusalem has for the first time in 
 two thousand years become the city of peace For the first time the holy places 
 have been open to worshippers from all three great faiths For the first time no 
 group in the city or among its pilgrims has been persecuted or denied free 
 expression For the first time a single sovereign authority has afforded security 
 and protection to members of every nationality who sought to come to pray there 
 There have been efforts to re divide this   claim that peace can 
 come through division that it can be secured through multiple sovereignties 
 multiple laws and multiple police forces 
 This is a groundless and dangerous assumption which impels me to declare today 
 There will never be such a re division of Jerusalem 
 Never 
 We shall not allow a Berlin Wall to be erected inside Jerusalem We will not drive 
 out anyone but neither shall we be driven out of any quarter any neighborhood 
 any street of our eternal capital 
 Finally permit me briefly to remark on our future economic relationship The 
 United States has given Israel how can I tell it to this body The United States 
 has given Israel apart from political and military support munificent and 
 magnificent assistance in the economic sphere With America 's help Israel has 
 grown to be a powerful modern state I believe that we can now say that Israel 
 has reached childhood 's end that it has matured enough to begin approaching a 
 state of self reliance 
 We are committed to turning Israel 's economy into a free market of goods and 
 ideas which is the only way to bring ourselves to true economic independence 
 This means free enterprise privatization open capital markets an end to cartels 
 lower taxes deregulation You know there 's not a Hebrew word for deregulation 
 By the time this term of office in Israel is over there will be a Hebrew word for 
 deregulation 
 But may I say something that unites all of us across the political divide I 'm 
 committed to reducing the size of government and I 'm quoting Speaker Gingrich 
 quoting President Clinton saying that the era of big government is over It 's over 
 in Israel too 
 I believe that a market economy is the only way to effectively absorb immigrants 
 and realize the dream of the ages the ingathering of the Jewish exiles To 
 succeed we must uphold the market economy as the imperative of the future It 's 
 a crucial pre requisite for the building of the promised land 
 We are deeply grateful for all we have received from the United States for all that 
 we have received from this chamber from this body But I believe there can be no 
 greater tribute to America 's long standing economic aid to Israel than for us to be 
 able to say We are going to achieve economic independence We are going to do 
 it In the next four years we will begin the long term process of gradually 
 reducing the level of your generous economic assistance to Israel I am convinced 
 that our economic policies will lay the foundation for total self reliance and great 
 economic strength 
 In our Hebrew Scriptures which spread from Jerusalem to all of mankind there is 
 a verse God will give strength to His people God will bless His people with 
 peace This is the original inspired source for the truth that peace derives from 
 strength 
 In the coming years we intend to strengthen the Jewish people in its land We 
 intend to build an Israel of reciprocal dialogue and peace with each and every one 
 of our neighbors We will not uproot anyone nor shall we be uprooted We shall 
 insist on the right of Jews to live anywhere in the Land just as we insist on this 
 right for Jews in any other place in the world We will build an Israel of 
 self reliance We will build an Israel with an undivided and indivisible city of hope 
 at its heart We will build a peace founded on justice and strength and amity for 
 all men and women of good will 
 And I know the American people will join us in making every effort to make our 
 dream a reality as I know the American people will join us in prayer God will 
 give strength to His people God will bless His people with peace

131,Eric Holder,Address at the Martin Luther King Commemoration,2011," Good morning I am honored to bring greetings from President Obama I think I 
 should sit down now I 'm I 'm also honored to bring greetings from my fellow 
 members of his Cabinet and from my colleagues in the Department of Justice I 'm 
 also grateful for the opportunity to join so many extraordinary leaders and friends 
 in celebrating the life and work of Ebenezer ’s former pastor and our nation ’s 
 greatest drum major for peace the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
 But But today I also want to note that we also celebrate the contributions of 
 his wonderful wife a woman a woman who often noted that she married not 
 only a man but also a movement and who was a force for change in her own right 
 Coretta Scott King 
 Throughout Throughout his life and most famously on the eve of his death 
 as he delivered the legendary Mountaintop speech that would be his final 
 sermon Reverend King asked himself when if given the choice of any era in 
 history he would choose to be alive 
 This question began with a journey through the ages At each stop whether 
 Mount Olympus or ancient Rome Lincoln ’s signing of the Emancipation 
 Proclamation or Roosevelt ’s call to fear only fear itself Dr. King asked himself 
 what era he would choose to be part of His own he decided explaining that 
 happiness comes from embracing the blessings and burdens of fate and the 
 opportunities that accompany living in times of unprecedented challenge I 
 know he said that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars 
 Today once again it is dark enough 
 Last week a senseless rampage in Tucson Arizona reminded us that more than 
 40 years after Dr. King ’s own tragic death our long struggle to end suffering and 
 to eradicate violence goes on But today once more we can see the stars 
 We see them in the courage of a husband who died shielding his wife from a spray 
 of bullets in the kindness of strangers who raced to the aid of those in need and 
 in the strength of a young energetic Congresswoman whose fight for her own life 
 has inspired each of ours 
 As we continue to mourn those recently lost and to pray for those now in need of 
 healing and comfort let us also recommit ourselves to carrying on Dr. King ’s work 
 and to honoring the values that were at the center of his life tolerance 
 non violence compassion love and above all justice 
 I wish that Dr. King could be here with us to see the America that he helped to 
 create I wish that Dr. King could see the good will and great works that he still 
 inspires I wish that Dr. King could see that this place of worship continues to be a 
 place of learning of healing and of hope and that the nation he fought to improve 
 soon will honor his   memorial in Washington D.C. on 
 our national mall within sight of monuments to our nation ’s first President and 
 its Great Emancipator 
 Today we must look upon our country as Dr. King did Half a century ago he saw 
 not only great challenges but also extraordinary opportunities And he saw 
 clearly that for every individual to be free our entire society had to be 
 transformed 
 Despite the odds against him he was undeterred Despite the obstacles before 
 him he kept his faith And despite those who tried to stand in his way in and out 
 of governments he proved that here in America large scale sweeping 
 righteous change is not impossible It is not too audacious It is not too ambitious 
 And it is not the province of God and prayer alone 
 Each of us has the power to improve the world around us Each of us also has the 
 responsibility the duty to do so Each of us must act 
 Dr. King ’s example provides proof that in the work of promoting peace and 
 ensuring justice one person can make a difference Individual actions count And 
 those who are willing to march toward progress to stand up for a principle or 
 simply to take a seat in a courthouse or a classroom at a lunch counter or the 
 front of a bus can help to change the world 
 Of course this is not easy work And it may be   as often 
 as faith But one of the most important lessons that Dr. King left to us is that it is 
 fine to be frustrated to be impatient and to be dissatisfied if it compels us to 
 take action 
 Dr. King was dissatisfied when anyone anywhere faced discrimination and 
 oppression He was dissatisfied when people of color were denied access to public 
 spaces to educational opportunities and to good jobs 
 He was dissatisfied when citizens who loved their country including those who 
 honorably served in uniform were not allowed to vote or were forcibly 
 discouraged from taking part in elections And he was dissatisfied when in 
 pursuit of his dream of a just and inclusive America he was told to wait to 
 cool off or to back down 
 What if he had listened What if he had given into doubt and cynicism What if he 
 had given up What if he had been patient Just think about where we would be 
 Our nation would not have accomplished the progress that has brought America 
 closer to its founding principles and made our country more true to our founding 
 documents For myself I ca n’t imagine that I would be standing before you today 
 on this celebration of Dr. King ’s 82nd birthday as our nation ’s 82nd Attorney 
 General 
 When I consider the opportunities that I have had and that my parents did not I 
 feel blessed beyond measure And I feel proud of our nation But like Dr. King 
 I am also dissatisfied 
 I am dissatisfied that here in Atlanta there are neighborhoods where young 
 people are more likely to go to prison than to college and that in America today 
 more than one million young people are active gang members 
 I am dissatisfied that more than 1.5 million American children have a parent 
 behind bars and that the majority of our nation ’s kids more than 60 percent of 
 them have been exposed to crime abuse and violence 
 I am dissatisfied that even though crime rates have been on a steady decline for 
 the last decade gun related deaths have increased each year since 2002 And I 
 am dissatisfied that over the last 12 months the number of police officers killed 
 by gun violence has   40 percent 
 So yes like Dr. King and like many of you I am dissatisfied But I am also 
 hopeful    I believe that we as a people have the ability to focus on matters that 
 are truly consequential and to move beyond trivial issues that only serve to 
 divide us And I am certain that America ’s continued progress will depend on our 
 ability to come together with open hearts and outstretched hands and to keep 
 faith in the ideals that guided Dr. King ’s work and that have made our nation 
 great 
 This capacity is within us Dr. King recognized this And our history has shown us 
 that in times of maximum peril the American people find ways to come together 
 It is time We must do so again 
 May God continue to bless our efforts May God continue to bless the memory of 
 one of his great servants And may God continue to bless the United States of 
 America

132,Shinzō Abe,Address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial,2016," Last year at the 70th anniversary of the end of the war I visited the United States 
 and made a speech as Prime Minister of Japan at a joint meeting of the U.S. 
 Congress   That war deprived many American youngsters of their dreams and 
 futures   Reflecting upon such harsh history I offered my eternal condolences to 
 all the American souls that were lost during World War II   I expressed gratitude 
 and respect for all the people in both Japan and the United States who have been 
 committed to reconciliation for the past 70 years 
 Seventy years later enemies who fought each other so fiercely have become 
 friends bonded in spirit and have become allies bound in trust and friendship 
 deep between us   The Japan U.S. alliance which came into the world this way 
 has to be an alliance of hope for the world 
 So I appealed in the speech   One year has passed since then   This time President 
 Obama for the first time as leader of the United States paid a visit to Hiroshima 
 the city which suffered the atomic bombing U.S. President witnessing the reality 
 of atomic bombings and renewing his determination for a world free of nuclear 
 weapons this gives great hope to people all around the world who have never 
 given up their hope for a world without nuclear weapons 
 I would like to give a whole hearted welcome to this historic visit which had been 
 awaited not   of Hiroshima but   Japanese people 
 I express my sincere respect to the decision and courage of President Obama 
 With his decision and courage we are opening a new chapter to the reconciliation 
 of Japan and the United States and in our history of trust and friendship 
 A few minutes ago together I and President Obama offered our deepest 
 condolences for all those who lost their lives during World War II and also by the 
 atomic bombings   Seventy one years ago in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki a great 
 number of innocent citizens lives were   atomic bomb without 
 mercy   Many children and many citizens perished Each one of them had his or her 
 life dream and beloved family   When I reflect on this sheer fact I can not help but 
 feel painful grief 
 Even today there are victims who are still suffering unbearably from the 
 bombings   Feeling of those who went through unimaginable tragic experiences 
 indeed in this city 71 years ago it is unspeakable   In their minds various 
 feelings must have come and gone that of those this must be in common   That 
 any place in the world this tragedy must not be repeated again 
 It is the responsibility of us who live in the present to firmly inherit these deep 
 feelings   We are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons   No 
 matter how long and how difficult the road will be it is the responsibility of us 
 who live in the present to continue to make efforts 
 Children who were born on that unforgettable day lit the light believing in 
 permanent peace   To make every effort for the peace and prosperity in the world 
 vowing for this light this is the responsibility of us all who live in the present 
 We will definitely fulfill our responsibility   Together Japan and the United States 
 will become a light for hope for the people in the world   Standing in this city I 
 am firmly determined together with President Obama   This is the only way to 
 respond to the feelings of the countless spirits victims of the atomic bombs in 
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki   I am convinced of this",0.0015064952895045,0.0045583308674395,0.0145767917856574,0.0070980116724967,0.0102171320468187,0.9597430229187012,0.0023002398665994,0.0896270396270396,0.494988344988345,62.22011679644049,0.2924528301886792,0.02168021680216802,0.11869436201780416,0.1184407796101949,23.806451612903224,0.0
133,Ashton Carter,Senate Armed Services Committee Statement on Counter ISIL Campaign,2015," Chairman McCain Welcome the witnesses Secretary Carter 
 SecDef Carter Thank you Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Reed Members of 
 the Committee Thanks for inviting us to come here today before you to discuss 
 the counter ISIL campaign in Iraq and Syria and along the way to address some 
 of the concerns Mr. Chairman that you you raised and to share with you 
 Senator Reed some of the plans and initiatives that the Chairman of the Joint 
 Chiefs of Staff and I are formulating for our campaign in both Iraq and Syria 
 This is the first time for me appearing before this Committee alongside Chairman 
 Joe Dunford who was just in the region last week as was noted I ’m grateful to 
 Joe for answering my and the President ’s call to step down from what every 
 Marine knows is a higher position namely Commandant to the Marine Corps to 
 become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to this Committee for 
 confirming Joe Thank you I ’m glad to have you here with me today 
 Before I turn to the subject of today ’s hearing I want to reiterate as I ’ve said 
 consistently since March and continue to believe that Washington needs to come 
 together behind a multi year budget deal that supports our defense strategy the 
 troops and their families and all elements of American ’s national security and 
 strength I understand significant progress was made on this overnight and I 'm 
 looking forward to reviewing the details but I welcome this major positive 
 development and applaud the members of this Committee for what you ’re doing to 
 help us get there 
 The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges but there as everywhere 
 our actions and strong military posture are guided by what ’s in America ’s 
 interests That ’s our North Star And amid this region ’s complexity and 
 uncertainty those interests are to deter aggression to bolster the security of our 
 friends and allies especially Israel to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf to 
 check Iran ’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint 
 Comprehensive Plan of Action and to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL This 
 last one ISIL poses a threat to our people and to friendly countries not only in 
 the Middle East but around the world 
 Today I will first outline the changes in the execution of our strategy that we have 
 considered and are now pursuing militarily to gather battlefield momentum in the 
 fight against ISIL Then I 'll address what Russia is doing in Syria and why we 
 wo n’t let it interfere with our campaign against ISIL 
 When I last spoke to this committee about our counter ISIL campaign and its nine 
 lines of essential military and non military effort,1 I made three things clear about 
 the military aspects first that we will deliver ISIL a lasting defeat second that 
 truly lasting success would require enabling capable motivated local forces on the 
 ground recognizing that this will take time and new diplomatic energy and third 
 that our strategy ’s execution can and must and will be strengthened 
 All that 's still true Our determination is unchanged even as the situation 
 continues to evolve and we continue to adapt to execute our campaign more 
 effectively And today I ’d like to elaborate on the third point and explain how 
 we ’re adapting our campaign to do more reinforcing what we know works 
 The changes we ’re pursuing can be described what  call the three 
 R ’s Raqqa Ramadi and Raids Before I explain what they mean let me also 
 note that I took actions to streamline command and control of the counter ISIL 
 military   the entire effort to a single general officer 
 Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland where in the urgency of the early phase of 
 the campaign last year several layers were added to the general officer already 
 present in Iraq 
 The first R is Raqqa ISIL ’s stronghold and administrative capital We 've been 
 clear for some time that we need to keep up pressure on Raqqa and that to that 
 end we will support moderate Syrian forces fighting ISIL that have made 
 territorial gains near Raqqa Indeed some of them are within 30 miles of Raqqa 
 today The Syrian Arab Coalition which we plan to strengthen through our new 
 equipping approach more on that in a moment will work over time with other 
 Syrian anti ISIL forces to push towards Raqqa To the south we plan to further 
 strengthen our partner Jordan And from the skies above we expect to intensify 
 our air campaign including with additional U.S. and coalition aircraft to target 
 ISIL with a higher and heavier rate of strikes This will include more strikes 
 against ISIL high value targets as our intelligence improves also its oil 
 enterprise which is a critical pillar of ISIL ’s financial infrastructure As I said last 
 Friday we ’ve already begun to ramp up these deliberate strikes 
 Part of this pressure includes our new approach to the Syria Train and- Equip 
 Program I like President Obama and members of this committee was 
 disappointed with that program ’s results We accordingly examined the program 
 this summer and have since changed it I use the word change not end 
 change the program 
 While the old approach was to train and equip completely new forces outside of 
 Syria before sending them into the fight the new approach is to work with vetted 
 leaders of groups that are already fighting ISIL and provide equipment and some 
 training to them and support their operations with airpower This approach builds 
 on successes that local Syrian Arab and Syrian Kurdish forces have made along 
 Syria ’s northern border to retake and hold ground from ISIL with the help of U.S. 
 airstrikes and equipment resupplies 
 If done in concert as we intend all these actions on the ground and from the air 
 should help shrink ISIL ’s territory into a smaller and smaller area and create new 
 opportunities for targeting ISIL ultimately denying this evil movement any safe 
 haven in its supposed heartland 
 The second R is Ramadi the capital of Iraq ’s Anbar province which serves as a 
 critical example of the Abadi government ’s commitment to work with local Sunni 
 communities with our help to retake and hold ground from ISIL and in turn to 
 build momentum to eventually go northward to Mosul 
 Under Prime Minister Abadi ’s leadership the Iraqis have begun to use 
 American made F-16s to support counter ISIL operations and have empowered 
 capable battlefield commanders to step forward As we see more progress towards 
 assembling capable and motivated Iraqi forces under Baghdad ’s control and 
 including Sunni elements we 're willing to continue to provide more enabling 
 capabilities and fire support to help them succeed However the Iraqi government 
 and security forces will have to take certain steps militarily to make sure our 
 progress sticks 
 We need to see more in the direction of multi sectarian governance and defense 
 leadership For example we ’ve given the Iraqi government two battalions worth 
 of equipment for mobilizing Sunni tribal forces as we continue to provide this 
 support the Iraqi government must ensure it is distributed effectively If local 
 Sunni forces are n’t sufficiently equipped regularly paid and empowered as 
 co equal members of the Iraqi Security Forces ISIL ’s defeats in Anbar will only be 
 temporary 
 The third and final R is raids signal signaling that we wo n’t hold back from 
 supporting capable partners in opportunistic attacks against ISIL or conducting 
 such missions directly   the air or direct action on the 
 ground Last week ’s rescue operation was   forces with U.S. 
 advisers in support One of those accompanying advisors Master Sergeant Joshua 
 Wheeler heroically acted to ensure the overall success of the mission and lost his 
 life in the process 
 The death of any service member is a tragedy and as I told his family and 
 teammates this weekend we offer our condolences to Master Sergeant Wheeler ’s 
 loved ones for their loss While our mission in Iraq is to train advise and assist 
 our Iraqi partners in situations such as that operation where we have 
 actionable intelligence and a capable partner force we want to support our 
 partners and we will 
 At the same time the raid on Abu Sayyaf ’s home the strikes against Junaid 
 Hussain and most recently Sanafi al Nasr should all serve notice to ISIL and other 
 terrorist leaders that once we locate them no target is beyond our reach 
 As we ’ve looked at how to gather momentum and adapt to the changing 
 battlefield some have discussed putting in a buffer zone humanitarian zone or 
 no fly zone in Syria We have analyzed various options and the political and 
 military requirements of each These options are complex and raise some 
 challenges which I 'm prepared to discuss in answer to your questions 
 Let me now turn to Russia ’s involvement in Syria To be clear we are not 
 cooperating with Russia and we ’re not letting Russia impact the pace or scope of 
 our campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria While we negotiated a document on 
 safety of flight with the Russian Minister of Defense we do not align ourselves 
 more broadly with their military actions because instead of singularly attacking 
 ISIL as they said they were going to do they are primarily attacking the Syrian 
 opposition as the Chairman has noted which further fuels the tragic civil war 
 there Their actions suggest a doubling down on their longstanding relationship 
 with Assad sending advisers artillery and aviation to enable and support the 
 Assad regime and Iranian forces in attacking moderates who oppose the regime 
 and are essential to Syria ’s political transition And it appears the vast majority of 
 their  as high as 85 to 90 percent use dumb bombs 
 which obviously increases the possibility of civilian casualties 
 So as Russia acts in a coalition of two with Iran at its side the United States will 
 continue to strengthen our 65 nation global coalition Even as we ’ve reached an 
 understanding with the Russians on safety protocols for coalition pilots over Syria 
 we will keep prosecuting our counter ISIL campaign unabated We will keep 
 supporting the moderate Syrian opposition along with our other commitments to 
 friends and allies in the region And consistent with our strong and balanced 
 approach towards Russian aggression elsewhere in the world including NATO and 
 Ukraine we will keep the door open for Russia to contribute to efforts toward a 
 political solution in which which in the final answer analysis is the only 
 answer to the Syrian conflict 
 I have discussed the military strategy and accompanying campaign but before I 
 conclude I remind the Committee that defeating ISIL and protecting America 
 requires coordinated efforts across all of the so called nine lines of effort to 
 include supporting effective governance in Iraq enhancing intelligence collection 
 disrupting ISIL ’s financing countering ISIL ’s messaging stopping the flow of 
 foreign fighters providing humanitarian support and protecting our homeland 
 where other departments and agencies of our government have the lead

134,Neil Gorsuch,U.S. Supreme Court Nomination Acceptance Address,2017," Mr. President thank you very much 
 Mr. President Mr. Vice President you and your team have shown me great 
 courtesy in this process and you ’ve entrusted me with a most solemn assignment 
 Standing here in a house of history and acutely aware of my own imperfections I 
 pledge that if I am confirmed I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful 
 servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country 
 For the last decade I ’ve worked as a federal judge in a court that spans six 
 Western states serving about 20 percent of the continental United States and 
 about 18 million people The men and women I ’ve worked with at every level in 
 our circuit are an inspiration to me I ’ve watched them fearlessly tending to the 
 rule of law enforcing the promises of our Constitution and living out daily their 
 judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike following the 
 law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs 
 I think of them tonight 
 Of course the Supreme Court ’s work is vital not just to a region of the country but 
 to the whole vital to the protection of the people ’s liberties under law and to 
 the continuity of our Constitution the greatest charter of human liberty the world 
 has ever known 
 The towering judges that have served in this particular seat of the Supreme Court 
 including Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson are much in my mind at this moment 
 Justice Scalia was a lion of the law Agree or disagree with him all of his 
 colleagues on the bench share[d his his wisdom and his humor And like them 
 I miss him 
 I began my legal career working for Byron White the last Coloradan to serve on 
 the Supreme Court and the only justice to lead the NFL in rushing.1 He was one of 
 the smartest and most courageous men I ’ve ever known When Justice White 
 retired he gave me the chance to work for Justice Kennedy as well Justice 
 Kennedy was incredibly welcoming and gracious and like Justice White he taught 
 me so much I am forever grateful And if you ’ve ever met Judge David Sentelle 
 you ’ll know just how lucky I was to land a clerkship with him right out of school 
 Judge Sentelle Thanks Neil 
 Judge Gorsuch Thank you These judges brought me up in the law Truly I would 
 not be here without them Today is as much their day as it is mine 
 In the balance of my professional life I ’ve had the privilege of working as a 
 practicing lawyer and teacher I ’ve enjoyed wonderful colleagues whose support 
 means so much to me at this moment as it has year in and year out Practicing in 
 the trial work trenches of the law I saw too that when we judges don our robes 
 it does n’t make us any smarter but it does serve as a reminder of what ’s expected 
 of us impartiality and independence collegiality and courage 
 As this process now moves to the Senate I look forward to speaking with 
 members from both side of the aisle to answering their questions and to hearing 
 their concerns I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body 
 in the world and I respect the important role the Constitution affords it in the 
 confirmation of our judges 
 I respect too the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress and not the courts 
 to write new laws It is the role of judges to apply not alter the work of the 
 people ’s representatives A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very 
 likely a bad judge stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law 
 demands 
 I am so thankful tonight for my family my friends and my faith These are the 
 things that keep me grounded at life ’s peaks and have sustained me in its valleys 
 To Louise my incredible wife and companion of 20 years my cherished daughters 
 who are watching on TV and all my family and friends I can not thank you 
 enough for your love and for your prayers I could not attempt this without you 
 Mr. President I am honored and I am humbled

135,Gabriel Latner,Proposition This House Believes That Israel is a Rogue State Affirmative Debate,2010," his is a war of ideals and the other speakers here tonight are rightfully 
 idealists I ’m not I ’m a realist I ’m here to win I have a single goal this 
 evening to have at least a plurality of you walk out of the Aye door I 
 face a singular challenge most if not all of you have already made up 
 your minds 
 This issue is too polarizing for the vast majority of you not to already have 
 a set opinion I ’d be willing to bet that half of you strongly support the 
 motion and half of you strongly oppose it I want to win and we ’re 
 destined for a tie I ’m tempted to do what my fellow speakers are going to 
 do simply rehash every bad thing the Israeli government has ever done 
 in an attempt to satisfy those of you who agree with them And perhaps 
 they ’ll even guilt one of you rare undecided into voting for the proposition 
 or more accurately against Israel 
 It would be so easy to twist the meaning and significance of international 
 laws to make Israel look like a criminal state But that ’s been done to 
 death It would be easier still to play to your sympathy with personalized 
 stories of Palestinian suffering And they can give very eloquent speeches 
 on those issues But the truth is that treating people badly whether 
 they ’re your citizens or an occupied nation does not make a state rogue 
 If it did Canada the US and Australia would all be rogue states based on 
 how they treat their indigenous populations Britain ’s treatment of the 
 Irish would easily qualify them to wear this sobriquet These arguments 
 while emotionally satisfying lack intellectual rigor 
 More importantly I just do n’t think we can win with those arguments It 
 wo n’t change the numbers Half of you will agree with them half of you 
 wo n’t So I ’m going to try something different something a little 
 unorthodox I ’m going to try and convince the die hard Zionists and Israel 
 supporters here tonight to vote for the proposition 
 By the end of my speech I will have presented five pro Israel arguments 
 that show Israel is if not a rogue state then at least rogue ish Let me 
 be clear I will not be arguing that Israel is bad I will not be arguing 
 that it does n’t deserve to exist I wo n’t be arguing that it behaves worse 
 than every other country I will only be arguing that Israel is rogue 
 THE WORD rogue has come to have exceptionally damning connotations 
 But the word itself is value neutral The OED defines rogue as Aberrant 
 anomalous misplaced occurring esp in isolation at an unexpected place 
 or time while a dictionary from a far greater institution gives this 
 definition behaving in ways that are not expected or not normal often in 
 a destructive way 
 These definitions and others center on the idea of anomaly the 
 unexpected or uncommon Using this definition a rogue state is one that 
 acts in an unexpected uncommon or aberrant manner A state that 
 behaves exactly like Israel 
 The first argument is statistical The fact that Israel is a Jewish state alone 
 makes it anomalous enough to be dubbed a rogue state There are 195 
 countries in the world Some are Christian some Muslim some are secular 
 Israel is the only country in the world that is Jewish Or to speak mathmo 
 for a moment the chance of any randomly chosen state being Jewish is 
 0.0051 In comparison the chance of a UK lottery ticket winning at least 
 £ 10 is 0.017 more than twice as likely Israel ’s Jewishness is a 
 statistical aberration 
 The second argument concerns Israel ’s humanitarianism in particular 
 Israel ’s response to a refugee crisis Not the Palestinian refugee crisis for 
 I am sure that the other speakers will cover that but the issue of 
 Darfurian refugees Everyone knows that what happened and is still 
 happening in Darfur is genocide whether or not the UN and the Arab 
 League will call it such There has been a mass exodus from Darfur as the 
 oppressed seek safety They have not had much luck Many have gone 
 north to Egypt where they are treated despicably The brave make a run 
 through the desert in a bid to make it to Israel Not only do they face the 
 natural threats of the Sinai they are also used for target practice by the 
 Egyptian soldiers patrolling the border 
 Why would they take the risk Because in Israel they are treated with 
 compassion they are treated as the refugees that they are and perhaps 
 Israel ’s cultural memory of genocide is to blame The Israeli government 
 has even gone so far as to grant several hundred Darfurian refugees 
 citizenship This alone sets Israel apart from the rest of the world 
 But the real point of distinction is this The IDF sends out soldiers and 
 medics to patrol the Egyptian border They are sent looking for refugees 
 attempting to cross into Israel Not to send them back into Egypt but to 
 save them from dehydration heat exhaustion and Egyptian bullets 
 Compare that to the US ’s reaction to illegal immigration across their border 
 with Mexico The American government has arrested private individuals for 
 giving water to border crossers who were dying of thirst and here the 
 Israeli government is sending out its soldiers to save illegal immigrants To 
 call that sort of behavior anomalous is an understatement 
 My third argument is that the Israeli government engages in an activity 
 which the rest of the world shuns it negotiates with terrorists Forget the 
 late PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat a man who died with blood all over his 
 hands They ’re in the process of negotiating with terrorists as we speak 
 Yasser Abed Rabbo is one of the lead PLO negotiators that has been sent to 
 the peace talks with Israel Abed Rabbo also used to be a leader of the 
 PFLP an organization of freedom fighters that engaged in such 
 freedom promoting activities as killing 22 Israeli high school students And 
 the Israeli government is sending delegates to sit at a table with this man 
 and talk about peace And the world applauds 
 You would never see the Spanish government in peace talks with the 
 leaders of the ETA the British government would never negotiate with 
 Thomas Murphy And if President Obama were to sit down and talk about 
 peace with Osama Bin Laden the world would view this as insanity But 
 Israel can do the exact same thing and earn international praise in the 
 process That is the dictionary definition of rogue behaving in a way that 
 is unexpected or not normal 
 Another part of dictionary definition is behavior or activity occurring at an 
 unexpected place or time When you compare Israel to its regional 
 neighbors it becomes clear just how roguish Israel is 
 And here is the fourth argument Israel has a better human rights record 
 than any of its neighbors At no point in history has there ever been a 
 liberal democratic state in the Middle East except for Israel Of all the 
 countries in the Middle East Israel is the only one where the LGBT 
 community enjoys even a small measure of equality In Kuwait Lebanon 
 Oman Qatar and Syria homosexual conduct is punishable by flogging 
 imprisonment or both But homosexuals there get off pretty lightly 
 compared to their counterparts in Iran Saudi Arabia and Yemen who are 
 put to death Israeli homosexuals can adopt openly serve in the army 
 enter civil unions and are   worded 
 anti discrimination legislation Beats a death sentence In fact it beats 
 America 
 Israel ’s protection of its citizens civil liberties has earned international 
 recognition Freedom House is an NGO that releases an annual report on 
 democracy and civil liberties in each of the 195 countries in the world It 
 ranks each country as free partly free or not free In the Middle 
 East Israel is the only country that has earned designation as a free 
 country Not surprising given the level of freedom afforded to citizens in 
 say Lebanon a country designated partly free where there are laws 
 against reporters criticizing not only the Lebanese government but the 
 Syrian regime as well 
 Iran is a country given the rating of not free putting it alongside China 
 Zimbabwe North Korea and Myanmar In Iran there is a special press 
 court which prosecutes journalists for such heinous offenses as criticizing 
 the ayatollah reporting on stories damaging the foundations of the 
 Islamic republic using suspicious i.e. Western sources or insulting 
 Islam Iran is the world leader in terms of jailed journalists with 39 
 reporters that we know of in prison as of 2009 They also kicked out 
 almost every Western journalist during the 2009 election I guess we ca n’t 
 really expect more from a theocracy 
 Which is what most countries in the Middle East are theocracies and 
 autocracies But Israel is the sole the only the rogue democracy Out of 
 all the countries in the Middle East only in Israel do anti government 
 protests and reporting go unquashed and uncensored 
 I have one final argument the last nail in the opposition ’s coffin and 
 it ’s sitting right across the aisle Mr. Ran Gidor ’s presence here is all the 
 evidence any of us should need to confidently call Israel a rogue state For 
 those of you who have never heard of him Mr. Gidor is a political counselor 
 attached to Israel ’s embassy in London He ’s the guy the Israeli 
 government sent to represent them to the UN He knows what he ’s doing 
 And he ’s here tonight And it ’s incredible 
 Consider for a moment what his presence here means The Israeli 
 government has signed off to allow one of their senior diplomatic 
 representatives to participate in a debate on their very legitimacy That ’s 
 remarkable Do you think for a minute that any other country would do the 
 same If the Yale University Debating Society were to have a debate where 
 the motion was This house believes Britain is a racist totalitarian state 
 that has done irrevocable harm to the peoples of the world would Britain 
 allow any of its officials to participate No Would China participate in a 
 debate about the status of Taiwan Never And there is no chance in hell 
 that an American government official would ever be permitted to argue in 
 a debate concerning its treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay But 
 Israel has sent Mr. Gidor to argue tonight against a 19 year old law 
 student who is entirely unqualified to speak on the issue at hand 
 Every government in the world should be laughing at Israel right now 
 because it forgot rule number one You never add credence to crackpots by 
 engaging with them It ’s the same reason you wo n’t see Stephen Hawking 
 or Richard Dawkins debate David Icke But Israel is doing precisely that 
 Once again behaving in a way that is unexpected or not normal Behaving 
 like a rogue state 
 That ’s five arguments that have been directed at the supporters of Israel 
 But I have a minute or two left And here ’s an argument for all of you 
 Israel willfully and forcefully disregards international law In 1981 Israel 
 destroyed Osirak Saddam Hussein ’s nuclear bomb lab Every government 
 in the world knew that Hussein was building a bomb And they did nothing 
 Except for Israel 
 Yes in doing so they broke international law and custom But they also 
 saved us all from a nuclear Iraq That rogue action should earn Israel a 
 place of respect in the eyes of all freedom loving peoples But it has n’t 
 But tonight while you listen to us prattle on I want you to remember 
 something While you ’re here Khomeini ’s Iran is working towards the 
 Bomb And if you ’re honest with yourself you know that Israel is the only 
 country that can and will do something about it Israel will out of 
 necessity act in a way that is the not the norm and you ’d better hope that 
 they do it in a destructive manner Any sane person would rather a rogue 
 Israel than a nuclear Iran",0.0570810250937938,0.0543779172003269,0.0392713025212287,0.0164425875991582,0.8092241287231445,0.0164557565003633,0.007147338707,0.1246989934185056,0.4938566266615045,50.42726573426575,0.3171589310829817,0.0254602428515472,0.08241758241758242,0.0606330806954971,19.007407407407406,0.0

 the Committee and to highlight parts of my 
 biography and experience I come before you 
 as an American citizen who has devoted the 
 majority of my life 33 years to service to the 
 country that all of us love love Like my 
 colleagues I entered the Foreign Service 
 understanding that my job was to implement 
 the foreign policy interests of this nation as 
  and Congress and to 
 do so regardless of which person or party 
 was in power I had no agenda other than to 
 pursue our stated foreign policy goals My 
 service is an expression of gratitude for all 
 that this country has given to me and to my 
 family My late parents did not have the good 
 fortune to come of age in a free society My 
 father fled the Soviets before ultimately 
 finding refuge in the United States My 
 mother ’s family escaped the USSR after the 
 Bolshevik Revolution and she grew up 
 stateless in Nazi Germany before also 
 eventually making her way to the United 
 States Their personal histories my personal 
 history gave me both deep gratitude 
 towards the United States and great empathy 
 for others like the Ukrainian people who 
 want to be free I joined the Foreign Service 
 during the Reagan Administration and 
 subsequently served three other Republican 
 Presidents as well as two Democratic 
 Presidents It was my great honor to be 
 appointed to serve as an ambassador three 
 times--   once by 
 Barack Obama There is a perception that 
 diplomats lead a comfortable life throwing 
 dinner parties in fancy homes Let me tell you 
 about some of my reality It has not always 
 been easy I have moved 13 times and served 
 in seven different countries five of them 
 hardship posts My first tour was Mogadishu 
 Somalia an increasingly dangerous place as 
 that country ’s civil war kept grinding on and 
 the government was weakening The military 
 took over policing functions in a particularly 
 brutal way and basic service services 
 disappeared Several years later after the 
 Soviet Union collapsed I helped open our 
 Embassy in Tashkent Uzbekistan As we were 
 establishing relations with a new country our 
 small Embassy was 
 who sprayed the Embassy building with 
 gunfire I later served in Moscow In 1993 
 during the attempted coup in in Russia I 
 was caught in crossfire between presidential 
 and parliamentary forces It took us three 
 tries me without a helmet or body armor to 
 get into a vehicle to go to the Embassy We 
 went because the Ambassador asked us to 
 come And we went because it was our duty 
 From August 2016 until May 2019 I served 
 as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine During 
 my tenure in Ukraine I went to the Front Line 
 approximately ten times during a hot war to 
 show the American flag to hear what was 
 going on sometimes literally as we heard 
 the impact of artillery and to see how our 
 assistance dollars were being put to use I 
 worked to advance U.S. policy fully embraced 
 by Democrats and Republicans alike to help 
 Ukraine become a stable and independent 
 democratic state with a market economy 
 integrated into Europe A secure democratic 
 and free Ukraine serves not just the 
 Ukrainian people but the American people as 
 well That ’s why it was our policy continues 
 to be our policy to help the Ukrainians 
 achieve their objectives they matched our 
 objectives The U.S. is the most powerful 
 country in the history of the world in large 
 part because of our values And our values 
 have made possible the network of alliances 
 and partnerships that buttresses our own 
 strength Ukraine with an enormous 
 landmass and a large population has the 
 potential to be a significant commercial and 
 political partner for the United States as well 
 as a force multiplier on the security side We 
 see the potential in Ukraine Russia sees by 
 contrast sees the risk The history is not 
 written yet but Ukraine could move out of 
 Russia ’s orbit And now Ukraine is a 
 battleground for great power competition 
 with a hot war for the control of territory and 
 a hybrid war to control Ukraine ’s leadership 
 The U.S. has provided significant security 
 assistance since the onset of the war against 
 Russia in 2014 And the Trump 
 Administration strengthened our policy by 
 approving the provision to Ukraine of 
 anti tank missiles known as Javelins 
 Supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do 
 It 's also the smart thing to do If Russia 
 prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian 
 dominion we can expect to see other 
  expand its territory and 
 its influence As critical as the war against 
 Russia is Ukraine ’s struggling democracy has 
 an equally important challenge battling the 
 Soviet legacy of corruption which has 
 pervaded Ukraine ’s government Corruption 
 makes Ukraine ’s leaders ever vulnerable to 
 Russia and the Ukrainian people understand 
 that That ’s why they launched the Revolution 
 of Dignity in 2014 demanding to be a part of 
 Europe demanding the transformation of the 
 system demanding to live under the rule of 
 law Ukrainians wanted the law to apply 
 equally to all people whether the individual 
 in question is the President or any other 
 citizen It was a question of fairness of 
 dignity Here again there is a coincidence of 
 interests Corrupt leaders are inherently less 
 trustworthy while an honest and accountable 
 Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian 
 partnership more reliable and more valuable 
 to the United States A level playing field in 
 this strategically located country bordering 
 four NATO allies creates an environment in 
 which U.S. business can more easily trade 
 invest and profit Corruption is also a 
 security issue because corrupt officials are 
 vulnerable to Moscow In short it is in 
 America ’s national security interest to help 
 Ukraine transform into a country where the 
 rule of law governs and corruption is held in 
 check It was and remains a top U.S. 
 priority to help Ukraine fight corruption And 
 significant progress has been made since the 
 2014 Revolution of Dignity Unfortunately as 
 the past couple of months have underlined 
 not all Ukrainians embraced our 
 anti corruption work Thus perhaps it was 
 not surprising that when our anti corruption 
 efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or 
 power Ukrainians who preferred to play by 
 the old corrupt rules sought to remove me 
 What continues to amaze me is that they 
 found Americans willing to partner with them 
 and working together they apparently 
 succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a 
 U.S. Ambassador How could our system fail 
 like this How is it that foreign corrupt 
 interests could manipulate our government 
 Which country ’s interests are served when 
 the very corrupt behavior we have been 
 criticizing is allowed to prevail Such conduct 
 undermines the U.S. exposes our friends and 
 widens the playing field for autocrats like 
 President Putin Our leadership depends on 
 the power of our example and the 
 consistency of our purpose Both have now 
 been opened to question With that 
 background in mind I 'd like to briefly 
 address some of the factual issues I expect 
 you you may want to ask me about 
 starting with my timeline in Ukraine and the 
 events about which I do and do not have 
 first hand knowledge I arrived in Ukraine on 
 August 22nd 2016 and left Ukraine 
 permanently on May 20th 2019 There are a 
 number of events you are investigating to 
 which I can not bring any first hand 
 knowledge The events that pre dated my 
 Ukraine service include a the release of the 
 so called Black Ledger and b Mr. 
 Manafort ’s subsequent resignation from 
 President Trump ’s campaign and c the 
 departure from office of former Prosecutor 
 General Viktor Shokin Several other events 
 occurred after I returned from Ukraine These 
 include d President Trump ’s July 25th 
 2019 call with President Zelenskiy e the 
 discussions surrounding that phone call and 
 f any discussions surrounding the delay of 
 security assistance to Ukraine in the summer 
 of 2019 As for events during my tenure in 
 Ukraine I want to to reiterate first that the 
 allegation that I disseminated a Do Not 
 Prosecute list was a fabrication Mr. 
 Lutsenko the former Ukrainian Prosecutor 
 General who made that allegation has 
 acknowledged that the list never existed I 
 did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian 
 officials who they should or should not 
 prosecute Instead I advocated the U.S. 
 position that rule of law should prevail and 
 Ukrainian law enforcement prosecutors and 
 judges should stop wielding their power 
 selectively as a political weapon against their 
 adversaries and start dealing with all 
 consistently and according to the law Also 
 untrue are unsourced allegations that I told 
 unidentified Embassy employees or Ukrainian 
 officials that President Trump ’s orders should 
 be ignored because he was going to be 
 impeached or for any other reason I did not 
 and would not say such a thing Such 
 statements would be inconsistent with my 
 training as a Foreign Service Officer and my 
 role as an Ambassador The Obama 
 Administration did not ask me to help the 
 the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump 
 campaign nor would I have taken any such 
 steps if they had Partisanship of this type is 
 not compatible with the role of a career 
 Foreign Service Officer I have never met 
 Hunter Biden nor have I had any direct or 
 indirect conversations with him And although 
 I have met former Vice President Biden 
 several times over the course of our many 
 years in government service neither he nor 
 the previous Administration ever raised the 
 issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with 
 me With respect to Mayor Giuliani I have 
 had only minimal contact with him a total 
 of three none related to the events at issue I 
 do not understand Mr. Giuliani ’s motives for 
 attacking me nor can I offer an opinion on 
 whether he believed the allegations he 
 spread about me Clearly no one at the State 
 Department did What I can say is that Mr. 
 Giuliani should have known those claims 
 were suspect coming as they reportedly did 
 from individuals with questionable motives 
 and with reason to believe that their political 
 and financial ambitions would be stymied by 
 our anti corruption policy in Ukraine After 
 being   Secretary of State 
 for Political Affairs in early March 2019 to 
 extend my tour until 2020 the smear 
 campaign against me entered a new public 
 phase in the United States In the wake of the 
 negative press State Department officials 
 suggested an earlier departure and we 
 agreed upon July 2019 I was then abruptly 
 told just weeks later in late April to come 
 back to Washington from Ukraine on the 
 next plane At the time I departed Ukraine 
 had just concluded game changing 
 presidential elections It was a sensitive 
 period with much at stake for the United 
 States and called for all the experience and 
 expertise we could muster When I returned 
 to the United States Deputy Secretary of 
 State Sullivan told me there had been a 
 concerted campaign against me that the 
 President no longer wished me to serve as 
 Ambassador to Ukraine and that in fact the 
 President had been pushing for my removal 
 since the prior summer As Mr. Sullivan 
 recently recounted during his Senate 
 confirmation hearing neither he nor anyone 
 else ever explained or sought to justify the 
 President ’s concerns about me nor did 
 anyone in the Department justify my early 
  had done 
 something wrong I appreciate that Mr. 
 Sullivan publicly affirmed at his hearing that I 
 had served capably and admirably 
 Although then and now I have always 
 understood that I served at the pleasure of 
 the President I still find it difficult to 
 comprehend that foreign and private 
 interests were able to undermine U.S. 
 interests in this way Individuals who 
 apparently felt  efforts 
 to promote stated U.S. policy against 
 corruption that is to do our mission 
 were able to successfully conduct a campaign 
 of disinformation against a sitting 
 Ambassador using unofficial back channels 
 As various witnesses have recounted they 
 shared baseless allegations with the 
 President and convinced him to remove his 
 Ambassador despite the fact that the State 
 Department fully understood that the 
 allegations were false and the sources highly 
 suspect These events should concern 
 everyone in this room Ambassadors are the 
 symbol of the United States abroad They are 
 the personal representative of the President 
 They should always act and speak with full 
 authority to advocate for U.S. policies If our 
 chief representative is kneecapped it limits 
 our effectiveness to safeguard the vital 
 national security interests of the United 
 States This is especially important now 
 when the international landscape is more 
 complicated and more competitive than it has 
 been since the dissolution of the Soviet 
 Union Our Ukraine policy has been thrown 
 into disarray and shady interests the the 
 world over have learned how little it takes to 
 remove an American Ambassador who does 
 not give them what they want After these 
 events what foreign official corrupt or not 
 could be blamed for wondering whether the 
 U.S. Ambassador represents the President ’s 
 views And what U.S. Ambassador could be 
 blamed for harboring the fear that they ca n't 
 count on our government to support them as 
 they implement stated U.S. policy and protect 
 and defend U.S. interests I 'd like to 
 comment on one other matter before taking 
 your questions At the closed deposition I 
 expressed grave concerns about the 
 degradation of the Foreign Service over the 
 past few years and the failure of State 
 Department leadership to push back as 
 foreign and corrupt interests apparently 
 hijacked our Ukraine policy I remain 
 disappointed that the Department ’s 
 leadership and others have declined to 
 acknowledge that the attacks against me and 
 others are dangerously wrong This is about 
 far far more than me or a couple of 
 individuals As Foreign Service professionals 
 are being denigrated and undermined the 
 institution is also being degraded This will 
 soon cause real harm if it has n’t already The 
 State Department as a tool of foreign policy 
 often does n’t get the same kind of attention 
 or even respect as the military might of the 
 Pentagon But we are as they say the 
 pointy end of the spear If we lose our edge 
 the U.S. will inevitably have to use other 
 tools even more than it does today And 
 those other tools are blunter more 
 expensive and not universally effective 
 Moreover the attacks are leading to a crisis 
 in the State Department as the policy 
 process is visibly unraveling leadership 
 vacancies go unfilled and senior and midlevel 
 officers ponder an uncertain future The crisis 
 has moved from the impact on individuals to 
 an impact on the institution itself The State 
 Department is being hollowed out from within 
 at a competitive and complex time on the 
 world stage This is not a time to undercut 
 our diplomats It is the responsibility of the 
 Department ’s leaders to stand up for the 
 institution and the individuals who make that 
 institution still today the most effective 
 diplomatic force in the world And Congress 
 has a responsibility to reinvest in our 
 diplomacy That ’s an investment in our 
 national security it 's an investment in our 
 future and our children 's future As I close 
 let me be clear on who we are and how we 
 serve this country We are professionals We 
 are public servants 
 training pursue the policies of the President 
 regardless of who holds that office or what 
 party they affiliate with We handle American 
 Citizen Services facilitate trade and 
 commerce work security issues represent 
 the U.S. and report to and advise 
 Washington to mention just some of our 
 functions And we make a difference every 
 day We are people who repeatedly uproot 
 our lives who risk and sometimes give our 
 lives for this country We are the 52 
 Americans who forty years ago this month 
 began 444 days of deprivation torture and 
 captivity in Teheran We are the dozens of 
 Americans stationed at our embassy in Cuba 
 and consulates in China who mysteriously 
 and dangerously and in some cases perhaps 
 even permanently were injured and attacked 
 from unknown sources several years ago And 
 we are Ambassador Chris Stevens Sean 
 Patrick Smith Ty Woods and Glen Doherty 
 people rightly called heroes for their ultimate 
 sacrifice to this nation ’s foreign policy 
 interests in Libya eight years ago.1 We honor 
 these individuals They represent each one of 
 you here and every American These 
 courageous individuals were attacked 
 because they symbolized America What you 
 need to know what Americans need to know 
 is that while thankfully most of us answer 
 the call to duty in far ess dramatic ways 
 every Foreign Service Officer runs the same 
 risks And very often so do our families They 
 serve too As individuals as a community we 
 answer the call to duty to advance and 
 protect the interests of the United States We 
 take our oath of office seriously the same 
 oath that each one of you take to support 
 and defend the Constitution of the United 
 States against all enemies foreign and 
 domestic and to bear true faith and 
 allegiance to the same I count myself lucky 
 to be a Foreign Service Officer fortunate to 
 serve with the best America has to offer 
 blessed to serve the American people for the 
 last 33 years I thank you for your attention

137,Winston Churchill,Address on Unified Cooperation in Europe,1946," Mr. President ladies and gentlemen 
 I am honored   in your ancient university and by the 
 address which has been given to me on your behalf and which I greatly value 
 I wish to speak to you today about the tragedy of Europe 
 This noble continent comprising on the whole the fairest and the most cultivated 
 regions of the earth enjoying a a temperate and equable climate is the home of 
 all the great parent races of the western world It is the fountain of Christian faith 
 and Christian ethics It is the origin of most of the culture the arts philosophy 
 and science both of ancient and modem times 
 If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance there would 
 be no limit to the happiness to the prosperity and the glory which its three or four 
 hundred million people would enjoy Yet it is from Europe that have sprung that 
 series of frightful nationalistic quarrels   nations in their 
 rise to power which we have seen in this 20th century and even in our own 
 lifetime wreck the peace and mar the prospects of all mankind 
 And what is the plight to which Europe has been reduced 
 Some of the smaller states have indeed made a a good recovery but over wide 
 areas a vast quivering mass of tormented hungry careworn and bewildered 
 human beings gape at the ruins of their cities and their homes and scan the dark 
 horizons for the approach of some new peril tyranny or terror 
 Among the victors there is a babel of voices among the vanquished the sullen 
 silence of despair That is all that Europeans grouped in so many ancient states 
 and nations that is all that the Germanic races have   other to 
 pieces and spreading havoc far and wide Indeed but for the fact that the Great 
 Republic across the Atlantic Ocean had at length realized that the ruin or 
 enslavement of Europe would involve their own fate as well and has stretched out 
 hands of succor and of guidance but for that the Dark Ages would have 
 returned in all their cruelty and squalor Gentlemen they may still return 
 Yet all the while there is a remedy which if it were generally and spontaneously 
  majority of people in many lands would as 
 transform the whole scene and would in a few years make all Europe or the 
 greater part of it as free and as happy as Switzerland is today What is this 
 sovereign remedy It is to recreate the European fabric or as much of it as we 
 can and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace in safety 
 and in freedom 
 We must build a kind of United States of Europe 
 In this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple 
 joys and hopes which make life worth living The process is simple All that is 
 needed is the resolve of hundreds of millions of men and women to do right 
 instead of wrong and to gain as their reward blessing instead of cursing Much 
 work has been done upon this   of the Pan European Union 
 which owes so much to Count Coudenhove Kalergi and which commanded the 
 services of the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand 
 There is also that immense body of doctrine and procedure which was brought into 
 being amid high hopes after the First World War I mean the League of Nations 
 The League of Nations did not fail because of its principles or conceptions It failed 
 because these principles were   who had brought it into 
 being It failed because the governments of those days feared to face the facts and 
 act while time remained This disaster must not be repeated There is therefore 
 much knowledge and material with which to build and also bitter dear bought 
 experience to spur the builders 
 The League of Nations did not fail because of its principles or conceptions It failed 
 because these principles were   who had brought it into 
 being It failed because the Governments of those days feared to face the facts 
 and act while time remained This disaster must not be repeated There is 
 therefore much knowledge and material with which to build and also bitter 
 dear bought experience 
 I was very glad to read in the newspapers two days ago that my friend President 
 Truman had expressed his interest and sympathy with this Great Design 
 There is no reason why a regional organization of Europe should in any way 
 conflict with the world organization of the United Nations On the contrary I 
 believe that the larger synthesis will only survive it is if it is founded upon 
 coherent natural groupings There is already a natural grouping in the Western 
 Hemisphere We British have our own Commonwealth of Nations.1 These do not 
 weaken on the contrary they strengthen the world organization They are in fact 
 its main support And why should there not be a European group which could give 
 a sense of enlarged patriotism and common citizenship to the distracted peoples 
 of this turbulent and mighty continent And why should it not take its rightful 
 place with other great groupings and help to shape the onward destinies of men 
 In order that this should be accomplished there must be an act of faith in which 
 millions of families speaking many languages must consciously take part We all 
 know that the two world wars through which we have passed arose out of the vain 
 passion of a newly united Germany to play the dominating part in the world In 
 this last struggle crimes and massacres have been committed for which there is 
 no parallel since the invasion of the Mongols in --in the fourteenth century and no 
 equal at any time in human history 
 The guilty must be punished Germany must be deprived of the power to rearm 
 and make another aggressive war But when all this has been done as it will be 
 done as it is being done then there must be an end to retribution There must be 
 what Mr. Gladstone many years ago called a blessed act of oblivion ”2 We must all 
 turn our backs upon the horrors of the past We must look to the future We 
 can not afford to drag forward across the years that are to come the hatreds and 
 revenges which have sprung from the injuries of the past If Europe is to be saved 
 from infinite misery and indeed from final doom there must be this act of faith in 
 the European family and this act of oblivion against all the crimes and follies of 
 the past 
 Can the free peoples of Europe rise to the height of these resolves of the soul and 
 of the instincts of the spirit of man If they can the wrongs and injuries which 
 have been inflicted will have been washed away on all   which 
 have been endured Is there any need for further floods of agony Is the only 
 lesson of history to be that mankind is unteachable Let there be justice mercy 
 and freedom The people have only to will it and all will achieve their hearts 
 desire 
 I am now going to say something that will astonish you 
 The first step in the re creation of the European family must be a partnership 
 between France and Germany In this way only can France recover the moral and 
 cultural leadership of Europe There can be no revival of Europe without a 
 spiritually great France and a spiritually great Germany The structure of the 
 United States of Europe if well and truly built will be such as to make the material 
 strength of a single state less important Small nations will count as much as large 
 ones and gain their   to the common cause 
 The ancient states and principalities of Germany freely joined together for mutual 
 convenience in a federal system might each take their individual places among 
 the United States of Europe I shall not try to make a detailed program for 
 hundreds of millions of people who want to be happy and free prosperous and 
 safe who wish to enjoy The Four Freedoms of which the great President Roosevelt 
 spoke and live in accordance with the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter 
 If this is their wish if this is the wish of Europeans in so many lands they have 
 only to say so and means can certainly be found and machinery erected to carry 
 that wish to full fruition 
 But I must give you a warning Time may be short At present there is a 
 breathing space The cannons have ceased firing The fighting has stopped but the 
 dangers have not stopped If we are to form a United States of Europe or 
 whatever name it may take we must begin now 
 In these present days we dwell strangely and precariously under the shield and 
 will even say protection of the atomic bomb The atomic bomb is still only in the 
 hands of a State and nation which we know will never use it except in the cause of 
 right and freedom But it may well be that in a few years this awful agency of 
 destruction will be widespread and the catastrophe following from its use by 
 several warring nations will not only bring to an end all that we call civilization 
 but may possibly disintegrate the globe itself 
 I must now sum up the propositions which are before you 
 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations 
 Organization 
 Under and within that world concept we must re create the European family in a 
 regional structure called it may be the United States of Europe 
 And the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe 
 If at first all the States of Europe are not willing or able to join the Union we must 
 nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and those who can 
 The salvation of the common people of every race and of every land from war or 
 servitude must be established on solid foundations and must be guarded by the 
 readiness of all men and women to die rather than submit to tyranny 
 In all this urgent work France and Germany must take the lead together Great 
 Britain the British Commonwealth of Nations mighty America and I trust Soviet 
 Russia for then indeed all would be well must be the friends and sponsors of 
 the new Europe and must champion its right to live and shine 
 And therefore I say to you Let Europe arise",0.0040481830947101,0.002948427805677,0.5957624316215515,0.0069789444096386,0.0220123305916786,0.3638963997364044,0.0043532676063477,0.1289442140492561,0.4646163920113499,64.68032935584014,0.352165725047081,0.01457451810061119,0.12293144208037825,0.06791083462934162,25.023529411764706,0.0
138,Richard J. Gordon,Senate Session 39 Remarks on Chinese Law Governing Coast Guard Actions in the Disputed South China West Philippine Sea,2021," Mr. President 
 I 'm not going to interpellate the gentleman from Cavite Senator Francis 
 Tolentino However I would like to make a manifestation and perhaps even 
 include the referral of the said speech to the National Defense Committee Mr. 
 President the Defense Committee Mr. President 
 This is something that I think we must not let pass Mr. President When another 
 country claims the oceans surrounding us which we claim and for that matter 
 even threatens to demolish our fishing boats or the fishing boats of any country 
 that somehow get into that ocean Mr. President or that sea or for that matter 
 demolish structures built on islands that we claim or they claim or some other 
 nation claims This is a serious cause for concern 
 This is a shot in across the bow of all the claimants in the territories that is 
 composed of the claims involving claims on disputed territories or islands and is 
 something that we should have done a long time ago especially when the People 's 
 Republic of China started building artificial islands which is in violation of 
 international law Mr. President and then started claiming it as an island that 
 that is theirs 
 Having said that Mr. President as we all know in Pag asa Island we have if I 
 remember correctly built a beaching ramp and shipping harbor And we have 
 also built some sort of a runway there and some buildings out there which under 
 this new declaration of the the legislation of Congress puts our people there 
 our civilians there and particularly our armed forces in harms way or for that 
 matter when they speak of even NGO non governmental organization vessels 
 traversing the area would be subject to   these 
 are these are serious matters that I think must be discussed with our military 
 and with our Committee on Foreign Affairs 
 Now my good friend Teddy Boy Locsin the Secretary of Foreign Affairs I read 
 today said it is not our business because apparently in an effort to try to not 
 involve us in a headlong confrontation but I 'm sure he will go on back 
 channeling and ask for an explanation.1,2 
 At the very least I feel that China should explain what its intentions are pretty 
 simply because this creates a flash point in this area where 60 of the world is at 
 and where a lot of assets in terms of oil in terms of commerce pass through every 
 day 
 So when the Chinese Coast Guard is allowed to take and I quote all necessary 
 means including the use of weapons to stop or prevent threats from foreign 
 vessels how can a Bangka threaten the Coast Guard of China a fishing boat 
 as my good friend from Cavite says from Zambales or Mindoro or from other areas 
 like Palawan How can they be treated as threats of foreign vessels when these 
 are peacefully engaged in the struggle for life and trying to fish these oceans 
 In other words here is gunboat diplomacy where the Coast Guard personnel will 
 now be permitted to board our boats They are not satisfied with just ramming our 
 boats and then leaving them And now they are willing to inspect foreign ships So 
 assuming it is not Philippine vessels that they would inspect but if they start 
 demanding that they inspect other vessels this could this can precipitate 
 tension and could even lead to a shooting war Mr. President because Australian 
 vessels American vessels English UK vessels French vessels and other countries 
 have passed through these waters Mr. President 
 Now I think I hope we 're not looking at a country that has turned rogue that 
 has turned to be unilaterally aggressive in terms of you know making sure that 
 they assert their claims in a violent manner Mr. President I consider this a great 
 risk of miscalculation in these vast areas of disputed waters Using the same 
 words that they use any Coast Guard official of China can miscalculate the powers 
 within his craft or misunderstand his legal authority and start using that and 
 precipitate a conflict in the area Mr. President 
 Now I understand the Foreign Minister of China just  like to 
 know what they discussed with the President or with the Foreign Minister or the 
 Secretary of our country.3 If our If we are just going to you know turn the 
 other cheek or just quietly accept what is it is a creeping threat that I think 
 can escalate anytime especially with Taiwan especially with our own claims in 
 these areas especially with what is happening in Hong Kong especially with their 
 dispute with the Japanese in the southern islands 
 Mr. President I think that this deserves at the very least an executive session 
 where we can invite our officials determining policy on this island so that the 
 senate can be guided accordingly and so that proper appropriations can be made 
 by the senate to at least come up with a credible capability and perhaps even to 
 the point of facilitating expediting and speeding up for example submarines to 
 be   Navy or for that matter maybe even land based 
 missiles that are mobile so that they can not easily be destroyed 
 Now I 'm saying this if only to wake everybody up from the stupor that we 're 
 being led to believe We have a Chinese neighbor who has been kind to us They 've 
 been supportive of us But the other face of it who has threatened us and has 
 even threatened to acquire our own claims that have been there for several years 
 and is now going to threaten a very volatile atmosphere in these areas 
 Our fisheries have been taken from us Our people have been deprived of their 
 livelihood And I think China owes us an explanation as to what its true intentions 
 are whether they 're really a peaceful and friendly neighbor as I 've always 
 thought they were or they would change their suit or their coat into a coat of 
 armor that can become more aggressive and more dangerous to all kinds of folks 
 traversing that route 
 Now Mr. President I would like to request that the remarks made by this 
 representation as well as that of the gentleman from Cavite not only be given to 
 the Secretary to the Foreign Affairs Committee but also to the Defense 
 Committee  you will accept 
 Thank you very much Mr. President and I hope that we can see our way clear in 
 solving the problems that are presenting itself themselves slowly but surely in a 
 most threatening manner 
 Thank you Mr. President",0.0765154659748077,0.02527492120862,0.8283045291900635,0.002444758079946,0.045494969934225,0.0174383986741304,0.0045270146802067,0.0838338744588744,0.4981253865182435,47.36658435072144,0.3333333333333333,0.015988372093023256,0.109375,0.08224755700325732,39.457142857142856,0.0

 Shalom and welcome on onboard El Al Flight number 971 from Tel Aviv to Abu 
 Dhabi 
 This is captain Tal Becker speaking We are very pleased to host you aboard the 
 historic flight from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi 
 This flight records two significant events in the history of the state of Israel and 
 the region heralding another step towards regional peace For the very first time 
 an Israeli register an Israeli registered aircraft will overfly Saudi Arabia and 
 after a nonstop flight from Israel land in the United Arab Emirates 
 The duration of the flight with the shortened route over Saudi Arabia will be 
 approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes instead of what would have been more 
 than 7 hours up to now 
 At the end of this historic nonstop flight the wheels of the aircraft with the flag of 
 the state of Israel on its tail will touch down on the runway in Abu Dhabi the 
 capitol of the United Emirates 
 This will be another significant event in our history just as El Al was when peace 
 was signed between Jerusalem Cairo and Amman 
 We are all excited and look forward to more historic flights that will take us to 
 other capitol cities in the region advancing us all to a more prosperous future 
 Wishing us all salaam peace and shalom 
 Have a safe flight Thank you",0.0032083052210509,0.0031935458537191,0.0041690594516694,0.850132942199707,0.1134429350495338,0.0043641189113259,0.0214890427887439,0.2295454545454545,0.5113636363636364,61.78961538461539,0.34375,0.03859649122807018,0.16417910447761194,0.16666666666666666,25.90909090909091,0.0
140,Teresa Pike Tomlinson,Sweet Briar College Commencement Address,2015," Thank you Dean Amy Jessen Marshall 
 What an honor and privilege it is to be here today on this hallowed ground 
 speaking to this class of remarkable women 
 Many have asked how I intend to deliver remarks under the circumstances that 
 have brought us to this place at this moment I say as each of you do too No one 
 loved this place more no one more honors the impact this great institution has 
 had on countless lives and communities and professions Any one of us could do 
 this Any one of us would do this for the dignity and eternal grace of Sweet Briar 
 College 
 My remarks today will not be based in nostalgia or in emotionalism Today we 
 celebrate an institution which for over one hundred years has empowered women 
 to lead lifes sic of significance medical professionals jurists entrepreneurs 
 educators authors elected officials leaders of every sort We celebrate you Class 
 of 2015 perhaps the last brigade of women Sweet Briar will send out to help 
 change the world And I will tell you this the world is hungry for you confident 
 thinkers problem solvers solution makers If you were in the halls of Congress 
 this world would be a better more functional place 
 Your liberal arts education and a nurturing academic environment you have come 
 of age in makes you particularly able And with that ability comes the 
 responsibility to make your mark as the lasting insignia of the Sweet Briar College 
 legacy 
 What is so poetic so tragically beautiful is that Sweet Briar in what some say is 
 her last aching breaths is providing you a leadership lesson of a lifetime The 
 truth is Had you been at the table had you been called to action we would not be 
 here today at the proposed end of an era which is in desperate need of 
 continuance The reason why is because you have the asset you have the antidote 
 our Alma Mater was looking for 
 Your greatest asset right now other than your superior liberal arts education is 
 your inexperience You do not know how things have always been done You are 
  of experience and expertise You have the agility of 
 mind and the ingenuity that diminishes in us with each passing year Sit at any 
 table in life knowing that you have an asset that can not easily be replicated by 
 your more senior colleagues and associates It will make you bold Embrace it and 
 therein you will find conviction courage and faith 
 The rose you have earned and will now bear signals to the world that you are 
 original This Sweet Briar single sex educational experience makes you so Your 
 choice of Sweet Briar College tells a fascinating story of individuality You do not 
 follow the herd You are emotionally and intellectually self reliant You take 
 serious things seriously You value relationships and experiential learning 
 something you can not get online or in auditoria of mass education You value logic 
 and deductive reasoning sorely underused disciplines today 
 People are   Briar experience and they know immediately 
 that you are ready and able It has been the calling card of my life to great positive 
 effect and it will be in yours 
 After concluding my Sweet Briar educational journey on a day almost exactly like 
 today nearly 30 years ago I attended Emory University School of Law in Atlanta 
 Now for those of you that will be attending law school let me give you the scoop 
 Most will tell you to wear a baseball cap to avoid any kind of eye contact sit in 
 as far in the back as possible and do not let the professor notice you At least that 
 was the protocol for survival at Emory I missed that message however because I 
 was a Sweet Briar graduate and I came to Emory with a love of learning and a 
 confidence in ability and a willingness to engage So I sat on the front row 
 bright eyed coffee in hand and ready to go I could not wait to see my professors 
 brilliance on display Each day I was bursting with observations from the reading 
 assignment and eager to hear the observations of my classmates who day after 
 day remained mute You could feel the fear in the room 
 One day I was in my Civil Procedure class with a curmudgeonly professor After 
 class I bounded to the instructor ’s well with the youthful enthusiasm of a 
 22 year old to ask a burning question The professor glared at with me at me 
 with disdain and hissed Ah Ms. Pike I 've never met a graduate of a women ’s 
 college that did n’t think she had the most important thing to say Awohh thank 
 you I replied It was literally hours later that I stopped mid step and said I 
 think he was trying to insult me And ladies that is the effect of this great 
 institution It takes you in your most formative years it instills in you the 
 unquestionable importance of your voice and it demonstrates the power of your 
 well armed uncompromising mind 
 You are now programmed to trust the ingenuity of your inexperience and to revel 
 in it and therein you will see solutions no one else sees You are uniquely 
 equipped to find the door out of the dark tomb We could have used you at the 
 table in these proclaimed last days of our Alma Mater 
 Our lot may appear to be cast not by us   allow to hold the 
 reigns But all of us all schools all organizations all enterprises whatsoever need 
 take heed A great lesson is afoot A lesson of perseverance courage 
 righteousness and effective decision making 
 I have a confession to make I can not sing I can not draw or paint I literally have 
 some sort of impairment that prevents me from learning a foreign language as my 
 beloved Sweet Briar French professors Mr. and Mrs. Van Treese will gladly attest 
 But I can lead I was double dipped in it For good or bad that 's my gift It has 
 necessarily meant that I spend most of my days on the civic battlefield When 
 those who need a voice and are not able reach out I 'm there Those up to no good 
 somehow always cross my path 
 Many years ago I was involved in some serious litigation of great proportion No 
 one in the case was younger than my father It seemed everyone had gone to an 
 Ivy League college or law school and I was a thirty something year old Sweet 
 Briar educated lawyer from Columbus Georgia who dared to shed a light on things 
 many felt best left in the dark By all accounts this case was not going to go well 
 for me I knew that Moments before a critical hearing began I went to the only 
 place I could be alone the women ’s restroom and I stared into the mirror 
 There a test of leadership was born one I use to this day and I commend to you I 
 asked 
 Am I being reasonable 
 Have I worked as hard as anyone possibly could on this matter and 
 educated myself to all pertinent information 
 Have I listened to thoughtfully considered and respected contrary 
 views 
 And lastly are my motives pure Do I just want the best right thing to 
 be done whatever that may be 
 What is incredible about this litany is that it tests the foundation of justifiable 
 righteousness and on that basis I knew I could say something bold and 
 necessarily controversial I had been fortified with   to my 
 test I declared that I would go into the courtroom and say what others wanted to 
 dance around and avoid And I did People sat slack jawed as I explained what 
 was going on The judge ’s attention was transfixed My worthy adversaries had no 
 reply One finally uttered but Judge this is n’t the way we do things I though 
 had convinced the judge that maybe it was time we did do things this way and 
 justice was done that day 
 Transparency candor are fresh unexpected and attention getting People love the 
 truth That 's what they 're seeking daily on the internet and television and social 
 media People want the world to make sense They want to see how the dots 
 connect and you can help with that Dazzle   the well vetted 
 but unvarnished truth upfront People will believe in its authenticity and they will 
 soundly believe in you for delivering it 
 After all when you are a leader you are merely a conduit of information You 're a 
 vessel of action People confuse that all the time They wrongly believe that a 
 leader is the be all and end all Leadership is not about power it 's about service 
 and that service derives from those you are leading those who have placed their 
 faith in you not some divine superiority of thought or exclusivity of process 
 Leaders understand that solutions come from the most unlikely places The 
 solution may come from your perceived enemy it may come from those 
 perceived to be uninformed it almost always comes out of nowhere And that is 
 why inclusiveness is so important The larger you make the conversation the 
 more impressive the results Now there are people out there thinking No way I 
 am not about to tee up some broad conversation with a bunch of people I do not 
 know to discuss possible solutions when I know what the short list of viability is 
 I understand that sentiment but you 're going to fail as a leader if you follow it If 
 your ideas are so good if your short list so miraculous then test it against the 
 critical eye of stakeholders If you can not do that I suggest you know your 
 motives are n't pure You are not looking for the best solution You 're looking for 
 the solution most comfortable for you And that friends is not leadership 
 If you have hidden your hand put your finger on the scale or denied the voice of 
 others the result is as illegitimate as the day is long and you will certainly lose 
 respect and credibility among those you chose to exclude or ignore Invest respect 
 in others and in good process and it will return to you manyfold 
 Leadership takes courage not recklessness Innate fear is what makes a person in 
 a leadership position slip into secrecy and insular decision making If such a 
 person can just get the three like minded thinkers in the room they believe they 
 can make all the decisions without the mess of broad input or God forbid 
 controversy 
 Yet it 's amazing what you can accomplish when you surrender to the temporary 
 chaos and controversy of solution making There in all that choppy water you 
 find the current to the calm on the other side If you hold firm to the justifiable 
 righteousness of your effort you will either prevail on the course you have 
 planned or you will drift to a better point 
 Look Sweet Briar College is not the only school to have been brought to the brink 
 of closure Some have tumbled over as it appears we have Others pulled back 
 and found a new way Famously the Harrow School for Boys in Britain was once 
 threatened with annihilation Faced with the ravages of World War II the 
 unrelenting bombing of London and threats too horrific to imagine the Harrow 
 School feared it could be shuttered The alumni that could be gathered came to 
 pay a final homage to their beloved Alma Mater However ten months later a ray 
 of light appeared The Head Master called back its most celebrated alum the 
 nation ’s Prime Minister Winston Churchill to encourage the boys and the staff 
 forward There Churchill gave these words of encouragement to the Harrow 
 School and I quote 
 Another lesson I think we may take just throwing our minds back to 
 our meeting here ten months ago and now is that appearances are 
 often very deceptive and as Kipling well says we must meet with 
 Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same 
 You can not tell from appearances how things will go But for everyone 
 surely what we have gone through in this period and I am 
 addressing myself to the school surely from this period of ten months 
 this is the lesson Never give in never give in never never never In 
 nothing great or small large or petty Never give in except to 
 convictions of honor and good sense Never yield to force never yield to 
 the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy We stood all alone a 
 year ago and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed 
 we were finished All this tradition of ours our songs our School 
 history this part of the history of this country were gone and finished 
 and liquidated 
 Very different is the mood today Britain other nations thought had 
 drawn a sponge across her slate But instead our country stood in the 
 gap There was no flinching and no thought of giving in and by what 
 seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands though we 
 ourselves never doubted it we now find ourselves in a position where I 
 say that we have only to persevere to conquer.1 
 Now the situations of Sweet Briar College and Harrow School for Boys are 
 different no doubt One involved a troublesome debt level though increasing 
 assets a greater than desirable draw on an increasing endowment and a 
 several year decline in student enrollment though a dramatic increase in 
 student applications The other involved global war human decimation economic 
 collapse and a struggle beyond all tolerance One wants to throw in the towel the 
 other persevered 
 Ladies please know that giving up is always on the table Successful leaders 
 however are   do not choose it They choose to persevere If 
 you can keep a fixed vision of what is possible you will never drown in the morass 
 of doubt and defeat Simply to persevere is to conquer doubt and defeat If you 
 join us at the table we will persevere 
 A little over 114 years ago a remarkable woman2 stood right here and in the 
 discord and uncertainties of that male dominated era she saw the possibilities for 
 a world filled with strong educated women We are born of that vision We are 
 products of that legacy 
 And yet the false narratives that women ’s colleges are no longer viable rural 
 colleges are no longer viable or that Liberal Arts colleges are no longer viable 
 were bought and contributed to what threatens to be our Alma 
 Mater ’s downfall The false narratives permeated and provided comfortable 
 excuses for the inability or unwillingness to find a path forward Look at how these 
 false narratives were   the early days of our announcement of 
 the announcement of our impending demise Of course some acclaimed 
 Women ’s colleges are luxuries of the past and have dubious relevancy 
 Now we need to admit something to ourselves Upon the hearing of the startling 
 news of the proposed closure of Sweet Briar College too many of us hung our 
 heads for a moment and accepted its defeat For a split second we too lost faith 
 in the vision bequeathed to us We temporarily accepted the doubts of others 
 that Sweet Briar was n’t as strong as we thought It was n’t as valuable as we 
 thought Sweet Briar could n’t cut it in today ’s world and at today ’s standard For a 
 tick of the clock we hung our heads and Indiana Fletcher Williams wept until 
 we caught our breath that is and realized these are dangerous false narratives 
 for the sake of excuse and obfuscation We are the proof that these narratives are 
 untrue 
 Nevertheless this terrible time this unnecessary waste has come to pass 
 The Old Testament tells us that Queen Esther had come to a particular position in 
 the kingdom for such a time as this and Mordecai reminds her that she need not 
 think her position protects her for as goes her fate as goes the fate of those like 
 her so she will go So let me be clear I have heard more alarming dog whistles 
 about women who go to women 's colleges in these past two months than I have 
 ever heard in the male dominated area of the law I practiced or in Deep South 
 politics We should be  we allow the evidence of the 
 extraordinary results produced here at Sweet Briar to be diminished and 
  references so goes all our fates 
 To all women and men who respect women to everyone who takes the education 
 of women seriously whether you cried at the news of the shooting of Malala 
 Yousafzai or rejoice when you see Mika Brzezinski excoriate some pompous fool 
 on Morning Joe then you need to know this business about Sweet Briar 's days 
 being done because it 's not relevant anymore is a statement of ignorance and 
 offense Our fates are tied to one another to these young women graduating 
 today and to the legacy of Sweet Briar College And we should make it our charge 
 to live our lives in a way that reflects the worthiness of the college ’s mission In 
 doing so the extraordinary value of this education and the burning candles of our 
 lives will continue to cast unabated a lovely but powerful light 
 Ladies we were all built for each of our lives but what we share is this incredible 
 place and learning experience And I tell you that you are well equipped to do 
 anything you desire to do to accomplish any result to compete with the best the 
 country has to offer Because of the training you have received at Sweet Briar 
 College because of your understanding of respect and relationship because you 
 are programmed for endurance not quick fixes you are uniquely equipped to 
 tackle the tough issues and find solutions no one else sees or has the courage to 
 fathom if only you will join us at the table 
 This bittersweet day some come to prematurely mourn our dear Alma Mater who 
 has served us well and fulfilled her mission until thwarted from doing so We swim 
 in the pride of her legacy and are blessed to have been  are so 
 proud of you this graduating class of Sweet Briar College We charge you today to 
 take all you have learned and experienced and make the world regret we ever put 
 Sweet Briar College in jeopardy Make strangers stop and say if only we had 
 more like her Let us today vow to support women ’s education at every turn so 
 that none fall victim to easy false narratives of predestined failure And to those 
 who have led us to this regrettable point let us endeavor to forgive them 
 forgive the lack of transparency their lack of inclusiveness the lack of 
 perseverance and the failure of faith because truly they know not what 
 they 've done 
 As I close there is a special leader that I want to thank today Virginia Attorney 
 General Mark Herring called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to share two 
 important messages with you First he wanted me to convey his hardy 
 congratulations to the class of 2015 for your accomplishments Second he wanted 
 me to tell you that he will continue to work with those who love Sweet Briar and 
 care about its legacy and its future in hopes that we can reach the best possible 
 outcome 
 Godspeed and best wishes to you Class of 2015 Sweet Briar College ’s latest not 
 last latest graduates

141,Julius Genachowski,Remarks on Connect America and Jobs Creation Fund,2012," Today is indeed a momentous step in our efforts to harness the benefits of broadband Internet 
 for every American I am tremendously grateful to each of my colleagues for working hard and 
 working together to get us here This is a once in a generation overhaul of universal service 
 keeping faith with the nation ’s long commitment to connecting all Americans to communications 
 services 
 We are taking a system designed for the Alexander Graham Bell era of rotary telephones and 
 modernizing it for the era of Steve Jobs and the Internet future he imagined We are reaffirming for 
 the digital age the fundamental American promise of opportunity for all We are furthering our 
 national goal of connecting the country to wired and wireless broadband And we are helping put 
 America on its proper 21st century footing positioning us to lead the world in a fiercely 
 competitive global digital economy 
 Infrastructure has always been a key pillar of American economic success with telephone and 
 other infrastructure connecting consumers and businesses facilitating commerce and 
 unleashing innovation Broadband is the indispensible infrastructure of our 21st century 
 economy 
 Recognizing this fact for years respected voices have called universal broadband an essential 
 ingredient for American economic competitiveness and job creation In its 2007 report Rising 
 Above the Gathering Storm the National Academy of Sciences said that a]ccelerating progress 
 toward making broadband connectivity available and affordable for all is critical and urged 
 government   to take the necessary steps to meet that goal Our National Broadband Plan 
 correctly called extending wired and wireless broadband to all Americans the great infrastructure 
 challenge of the 21st century And last year IBM CEO Sam Palmisano expressed a view from 
 CEOs governors mayors and consumers He implored policymakers to fix the bridges but 
 do n’t forget broadband and said that a pervasive broadband infrastructure would be a powerful 
 generator of new jobs and economic growth 
 Today building on years of hard   and on Capitol Hill this Commission is acting 
 unanimously and on a bipartisan basis to meet this critical national challenge and bring the 
 Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation system into the broadband age Our action 
 will enable millions more Americans to work learn and innovate online It will open new vistas of 
 digital opportunity and enhance public safety It will create jobs in the near term and lay the 
 foundation for enduring job creation economic growth and U.S. global competitiveness for years 
 to come Today ’s reforms of the multi billion dollar Universal Service Fund will bring real benefits 
 to consumers and communities in every part of the country 
 Over the next year the Connect America Fund will bring broadband to more than 600,000 
 Americans who would n’t have it otherwise Over the following five years millions more rural 
 families will be connected And today ’s Order puts us on the path to get broadband to every 
  of the decade to close the broadband deployment gap which now stands at 
 close to twenty million Americans 
 We are also extending the benefits of mobile broadband coverage to tens of thousands of 
 unserved road miles areas where millions of Americans work live and travel These are areas of 
 frustration and economic stagnation for so many people where mobile connections are needed 
 but unavailable where small businesses lose out on customers and productivity and where 
 people in traffic accidents ca n’t reach 9 1 1 
 Today we make mobility an independent universal service objective for the first time providing 
 dedicated support through the world ’s first Mobility Fund Over the next three years we will 
 provide almost $ 1 billion in funding per year for universal mobility Mobile is one of the 
 fastest growing and most promising sectors of our economy and having the world ’s largest 
 market for 3 G and 4 G subscribers will be a key competitive advantage enabling us to lead the 
 world in mobile innovation 
 New wired and wireless broadband will be a lifeline for rural communities currently being 
  revolution Young people who did n’t see a future in their small 
 hometowns will now be able to access a new world of opportunity Entrepreneurs in small towns 
 wo n’t need to move to the big city to live their dreams instead small business owners doing 
 everything from selling beef to starting hunting lodges like residents I met in Nebraska wanted 
 to do will be able to reach customers in the next town city state or country and boost their 
 efficiency and productivity through cloud based services 
 Today ’s action will empower small businesses that otherwise could n’t exist in small town 
 America and create new jobs in those communities This includes farmers who need broadband 
 to access commodity pricing crop information real time weather reports and online auctions 
 During our process we heard this directly from farmers in rural America 
 Today ’s action will help connect anchor institutions which can play a vital role for example in 
 expanding basic digital literacy training in a world where broadband skills are necessary to find 
 and land jobs 
 Today ’s action has the potential to be one of the biggest job creators in rural America in decades 
 We estimate that the Order as a whole will unleash billions in private sector broadband 
 infrastructure spending in rural America over the next decade creating hundreds of thousands of 
 jobs   more Americans to engage in e commerce as buyers and 
 sellers the Order will grow the size of our overall online marketplace and provide a boost for 
 Main Street businesses across the country 
 Today ’s action will change the landscape for students who are now unserved by broadband 
 providing educational opportunity that would otherwise be denied 
 In now unserved areas it will change the landscape for seniors and people with illnesses 
 providing remote diagnostics and treatment to people who would otherwise have no access or 
 would have to travel for hundreds of miles to get care 
 And it will enable parents in now unserved areas to finally connect with their children in military 
 service overseas through video chat or other modern communications means that require 
 broadband 
 By constraining the growth of existing programs today ’s reforms will also minimize the burden 
 those programs place on all consumers keeping hundreds of millions of dollars in consumers 
 pockets over the next several years Our overhaul of the intercarrier compensation system will 
 gradually eliminate the billions of dollars in hidden subsidies currently 
 the country through their wireless and long distance phone bills Our staff estimates that the 
 consumer benefits of ICC reform will be more than $ 2 billion annually Consumers will get more 
 value for their money and less waste These material benefits flow directly from the policy 
 principles and structural reforms that we ’ve embraced in this Order 
 The reforms implement the idea that government programs should be modernized to focus on the 
 strategic challenges of today and tomorrow not yesterday Starting today USF will be 
 transformed into the Connect America Fund which will directly take on our country ’s 21st century 
 infrastructure   private sector to build robust scalable affordable 
 broadband to homes businesses and anchor institutions in unserved communities 
 Our ICC reforms will also advance the deployment of modern Internet Protocol networks And as 
 the telephone network transitions to an IP network the Order affirms our expectation that carriers 
 will negotiate in good faith on IP to IP interconnection for voice traffic 
 Today ’s Order also recognizes the growing importance of mobile broadband As I mentioned 
 today for the first time we make mobility an independent universal service objective and take 
 significant concrete steps to meet that objective 
 Also a first today ’s Order brings market based competitive bidding into universal service 
 support In a series of ways including auctions we have structured distribution of public funds to 
 ensure real efficiency and accountability in the Connect America Fund For the first time our 
 Order puts the Fund on a firm budget Fiscal responsibility was a principle we announced on Day 
 One and we ’ve adhered to that in this Order protecting the interests of the millions of consumers 
 who contribute into the Fund And we put in place a series of reforms to eliminate duplicative 
 funding and other funding where it ’s not needed and ca n’t be justified We also end arbitrage 
 schemes that take advantage of gaps closing loopholes in our rules 
 Faced with many complex and nuanced policy questions I believe this Commission has reached 
 the right solutions because we ’ve approached these issues the right way We did not rubber 
 stamp or adopt wholesale the proposals of any stakeholder or group of stakeholders Instead we 
 made our decisions on what ’s right for the American people and our economy based on facts and 
 data gathered in one of the most extensive records in FCC history including hearings and 
 workshops across the country and more than 2,700 substantive comments totaling tens of 
 thousands of pages 
 We have focused on putting consumers first calibrating the policies we adopt to maximize 
 consumer benefit We have been careful to ensure that affected companies have predictable and 
 measured transition paths so they can keep investing in their networks to better serve consumers 
 and support our economy And we have brought increased clarity to areas of uncertainty created 
 by tensions between new communications services like VoIP and old rules 
 Getting to this point was n’t easy It required us to make some tough choices about what the 
 Connect America Fund and consumers could and could not support Some proposals would 
 have required consumers to pay a greater share of the costs of reform or increased the size of 
 the Fund That would have put too much of a burden on consumers during these difficult 
 economic times 
 Some said that we should dramatically reduce the size of the Fund but that would have left 
 behind the millions of Americans being   with no prospect of 
 broadband connectivity Some would have had us operate as if we were writing on a blank slate 
 but that would have risked needless consumer disruption build out delays and other unintended 
 and undesirable consequences 
 Getting to this point not only required tough choices it required the engagement of many 
 stakeholders around the country of our partners in the federal government the states Tribal 
 communities the private sector and the non profit and consumer advocacy community I 
 appreciate the broad level of constructive engagement That very much includes the many 
 members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have worked for years to reform and 
 improve universal service and whose ongoing and constructive input is reflected in our action 
 today There are too many to thank individually but I am grateful to all of the members of 
 Congress who provided input and guidance 
 The President has been a consistent leader on broadband and the opportunities of technology 
 and our actions today help meet national goals of universal access to wired and wireless 
 broadband 
 I also want to thank our state partners who pioneered many of the reforms we adopt today 
 Moving forward I am pleased that the states will continue to play a vital role including a role in 
 ensuring that consumers are well   service program 
 I ’m deeply grateful to my fellow Commissioners who have worked tremendously hard to make 
 today possible Commissioners Copps and McDowell have been fighting to fix these programs for 
 years and Commissioner Clyburn ’s strong experience at the state level in South Carolina has 
 been invaluable in our efforts From top to bottom today ’s Order reflects the seriousness of 
 purpose and thoughtful input of each of my colleagues on the Commission It is a better Order as 
 a result and I thank each of you 
 At a time when citizens want solutions not gridlock I ’m proud that this Commission is approving 
 bipartisan reform of a broken system reform that will deliver massive benefits for the American 
 people 
 This would not have happened without the tremendous work of the staff without whom we would 
 not have been able to finally accomplish a goal that ’s been elusive for many years making reform 
 a reality Our staff has not only worked hard they have performed brilliantly crunching numbers 
 mastering complex technologies and operating at a world class policy level Today ’s Order is the 
 product of that tremendous effort I particularly want to thank the leadership team that managed 
 this process Sharon Gillett Ruth Milkman Carol Mattey Rebekah Goodheart Jim Schlichting 
 Michael Steffen and many others in our Wireline and Wireless Bureaus our General Counsel ’s 
 office and throughout the agency I also want to acknowledge the work of the team that 
 developed our National Broadband Plan for laying the groundwork for these reforms And I want 
 to particularly salute and applaud Zac Katz in my office the quarterback of our USF and ICC 
 modernization effort Without your leadership persistence and savvy these reforms simply could 
 not have happened 
 Of course our work is not yet done We have implementation work ahead and there will continue 
 to be intensive engagement with all stakeholders in response to the Further Notice of Proposed 
 Rulemaking we adopt today and in the months to come And we still face a tremendous challenge 
 in increasing broadband adoption an ongoing barrier to opportunity in both rural and urban 
 areas While there ’s no silver bullet the Lifeline portion of USF is part of the solution including a 
 significant investment in broadband adoption pilot programs I ’ve asked the staff to gear up 
 Lifeline reform for action this year 
 But wait there ’s more As my colleagues have also noted there ’s work to do on the contribution 
 side That ’s another important USF topic the Commission will address 
 I ’ll leave you with a closing thought In the 1930s and 1950s when Presidents Roosevelt and 
 Eisenhower directed federal funding to roads tunnels bridges and the national highway system 
 they were investing in then current technologies to connect our people and our communities The 
 same was true for electricity and telephone service also key 20th century universal service 
 achievements These investments have paid tremendous dividends for our economy and our 
 country 
 Broadband Internet truly is the information superhighway the key connective infrastructure of 
 the 21st century It ’s what will drive our competitiveness our economy and broad opportunity for 
 decades to come 
 Our action today is firmly rooted in sound principles that have served our country well in the past 
 and I ’m confident it will help deliver a bright future for all Americans",0.0076943463645875,0.0038682154845446,0.0038785305805504,0.7122004628181458,0.2349710315465927,0.0045070135965943,0.0328803285956382,0.0768365647355009,0.3744675094409136,36.19413997187027,0.2752136752136752,0.01725923369002416,0.07479224376731301,0.04917402996542451,28.12621359223301,0.0
142,John F. Kennedy,Veterans Day Address,1961," Mr. Gavin Mr. Gleason members of the military forces veterans fellow 
 Americans 
 Today we are here to celebrate and to honor and to commemorate the dead and 
 the living the young men who in every war since this country began have given 
 testimony to their loyalty to their country and their own great courage 
 I do not believe that any nation in the history of the world has buried its soldiers 
 further from its native soil than we Americans or buried them closer to the 
 towns in which they grew up 
 We celebrate this Veterans Day for a very few minutes a few seconds of silence 
 and then this country 's life goes on But I think it most appropriate that we recall 
 on this occasion and on every other moment when we are faced with great 
 responsibilities the contribution and the sacrifice which so many men and their 
 families have made in order to permit this country to now occupy its present 
 position of responsibility and freedom and in order to permit us to gather here 
 together 
 Bruce Catton after totaling the casualties which took place in the battle of 
 Antietam not so very far from this cemetery when he looked at statistics which 
 showed that in the short space of a few minutes whole regiments lost 50 to 75 
 percent of their numbers then wrote that life perhaps is n't the most precious gift 
 of all that men died for the possession of a few feet of a corn field or a rocky hill 
 or for almost nothing at all But in a very larger sense,1 they died that this country 
 might be permitted to go on and that it might permit it to be fulfilled the great 
 hopes of its Founders 
 In a world   the possibilities of conflict we meet in a 
 quiet commemoration of an historic day of peace In an age that threatens the 
 survival of freedom we join together to honor those who made our freedom 
 possible The resolution of the Congress which first proclaimed Armistice Day 
 described November 11th 1918 as the end of the most destructive sanguinary 
 and far reaching war in the history of human annals ""2 That resolution expressed 
 the hope that the First World War would be in truth the war to end all wars It 
 suggested that those men who had died had therefore not given their lives in 
 vain.3 
 It is a tragic fact that these hopes have not been fulfilled that wars still more 
 destructive and still more sanguinary followed that man 's capacities to devise 
 new ways of killing his fellow men have far outstripped his capacity to live in 
 peace with his fellow men 
 Some might say therefore that this day has lost its meaning that the shadow of 
 the new and deadly weapons have robbed this day of its great value that 
 whatever name we now give to this day whatever flags we fly or prayers we 
 utter it is too late to honor those who died before and too soon to promise the 
 living an end to organized death 
 But let us not forget that November 11th 1918 signified a beginning as well as 
 an end The purpose of all wars said Augustine is peace The First World War 
 produced man 's first great effort in recent times to solve by international 
 cooperation the problems of war That experiment continues in our present day 
 still imperfect still short of its responsibilities but it does offer a hope that some 
 day nations can live in harmony 
 For our part we shall achieve that peace only with patience and perseverance and 
 courage the patience and perseverance necessary to work with allies of diverse 
 interests but common goals the courage necessary over a long period of time to 
 overcome an adversary skilled in the arts of harassment and obstruction 
 There is no way to maintain the frontiers of freedom without cost and commitment 
 and risk 
 There is no swift and easy path to peace in our generation 
 No man who witnessed the tragedies of the last war no man who can imagine the 
 unimaginable possibilities of the next war can advocate war out of irritability or 
 frustration or impatience 
 But let no nation confuse our perseverance and patience with fear of war or 
 unwillingness to meet our responsibilities We can not save ourselves by 
 abandoning those who are associated with us or rejecting our responsibilities 
 In the end the only way to maintain the peace is to be prepared in the final 
 extreme to fight for our country and to mean it 
 As a nation we have little capacity for deception We can convince friend and foe 
 alike that we are in earnest about the defense of freedom only if we are in earnest 
 and I can assure the world that we are 
 This cemetery was first established 97 years ago In this hill were first buried men 
 who died in an earlier war a savage war here in our own country Ninety nine 
 years ago today the men in Gray were retiring from Antietam where thousands of 
 their comrades had fallen between dawn and dusk in one terrible day And the 
 men in Blue were moving towards Fredericksburg where thousands would soon 
  wall in heroic and sometimes miserable death 
 It was a cruel moment in our Nation 's history 
 But these memories sad and proud these quiet grounds this Cemetery and 
 others like it all around the world remind us with pride of our obligation and our 
 opportunity 
 On this Veterans Day of 1961 on this day of remembrance let us pray in the name 
 of those who have fallen in this country 's wars and most especially who have 
 fallen in the First World War and in the Second World War that there will be no 
 veterans of any further war not because all shall have perished but because all 
 shall have learned to live together in peace 
 And to the dead here in this cemetery we say 
 They are the race 
 they are the race immortal 
 Whose beams make broad 
 the common light of day 
 Though Time may dim 
 though Death ha[th barred their portal 
 These we salute 
 which nameless passed away.4",0.0021550308447331,0.0109871374443173,0.0256864856928586,0.0209807939827442,0.0680748522281646,0.8646236658096313,0.0074919979088008,0.0278198653198653,0.5993506493506493,54.89132828282831,0.3388059701492537,0.014434643143544507,0.12897196261682242,0.09195402298850575,35.628571428571426,0.0

144,Barbara Jordan,Sylvanus Thayer Award Acceptance Address,1995," To the Corps and to all of you here 
 I am delighted to have been chosen a recipient Sylvanus Thayer Award It 's a 
 personal tribute It places me in the company of a group of distinguished 
 Americans you believe exemplify the best of this institution You have placed me 
 among a group you feel best demonstrates the core principles of the United States 
 Military Academy Honor Duty Country 
 My being here is   here Why Your Corps You are cadets 
 You chose to come here and that decision to come to this institution was not a 
 trivial decision You had to discard unnecessary irrelevances and distracting 
 engagements commit yourselves to what Commit yourselves to a path 
 designed to bring distinction not just to you but a path designed to bring 
 distinction to your country 
 I believe I 'm looking at people who are the embodiment of the motto of this 
 institution Why Your desire to come here means that you were willing to go 
 through the rigorous training process you were willing to go through the rites of 
 passages which are West Point and I know that you have already shown that 
 West Point is a resource from which leaders will come 
 I know that it must be difficult to be a cadet and you probably think that 's an 
 understatement I know through conversations with some of your predecessors 
 and through anecdotes which filter through the Press and other media some of 
 those anecdotes are true some are exaggerated I know that your education is 
 unlike anybody else 's education Your peers across the country would shutter if 
 they had to go through the kind of things you had to go through in order to attend 
 this institution and be successful And I know I know that it is difficult for you to 
 live up to your own standards and the standards of this school and at the same 
 time try to understand the important philosophical context of a West Point 
 education 
 But it is important for each of you to take time out examine your purpose 
 understand that you are here not here simply to get a degree You could have 
 anywhere to just do that You 're not here just to go through the motions You are 
 not here just to endure whatever abuses are heaped upon   who 
 are your superiors 
 Think for a minute What do those words really mean They just roll off your 
 tongue duty honor country What are you talking about It has a resonance 
 Douglas MacArthur said they are hallowed words It is just not the sound of 
 those words placed together it is the assumptions which undergird what those 
 words really mean and let 's look at that 
 What are we talking about What are you talking about Can you do what is 
 necessary through service to your country to give those words such meaning that 
 they will suffice not just now but into the next century You have got to 
 understand that those words mean a lifetime commitment You fulfill their 
 meaning through service And you expand their meaning through the service your 
 render 
 Look at the words Duty A biography A biographer of the Duke of 
 Marlborough writing in 1894 said in England the noble selfless word duty has 
 long been the motto of her famous warrior sons A noble selfless word Duty 
 if you looked in the dictionary it would simply say something you have to do But 
 a noble selfless word 
 Dwight Eisenhower received this award 34 years ago And he was a person who 
 studied what duty really means And what he said No man can always be right 
 so the struggle is to do one 's best to keep the brain and conscience clear never to 
 be   and inconsequential reasons but to strive to 
 unearth the basic involved and then to do one 's duty 
 In the 193 years of this institution our famous warrior daughters and sons have 
 come from West Point They have led us in war and they 've led us in peace There 
 is something which sets them apart from everybody else What is it What is it I 
 believe it is the courage to deny self The ability to remain unswayed by unworthy 
 motives and inconsequential reasons 
 Why are you here Corpsmen Why are you here I believe one purpose above all 
 others stands out serve your country You made a decision which has 
 monumental consequences when you entered here Your decision has 
 consequences If I were to ask each of you Why are you here 
 you may not say the honest answer is to serve your country Some of you may 
 have a more practical reason Perhaps it was parental pressure Perhaps it was the 
 realization that you could not find an education of this quality anywhere else 
 Perhaps it was a desire to become the world 's premiere engineer 
 There is nothing wrong with personal motivation or with understanding the worth 
 of an education at this institution There is nothing wrong with the desire to be the 
 best The key to your success at this institution will be your ability to advance your 
 personal motivation into a self less motivation The rewards to you and your 
 country will be extraordinary 
 Those of you who accomplish great things in the service of your country will be 
 those who have learned the meaning of denial of self Selflessness Those of you 
 who will accomplish great things will achieve an elevation of character that 
 constitutes honor honor 
 Among the world 's great writers at the time of the founding of this school William 
 Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge each wrote about honor in the same 
 context in which we tonight are talking about it 
 What did Coleridge say Honor implies a reverence for the invisible and 
 supersensual in our nature Again a denial of sense And Wordsworth He said 
 honor is the finest sense of justice that the human mind can frame 
 You will be the decision makers of the future You will literally hold the lives and 
 fortunes of others within your power and it is my hope that your circumstances 
 will not include a shooting war but they very well may If you do not If you do 
 not develop warfare but they very well may If you do not develop honor if you 
 do not embrace the finest sense of justice the human mind can frame I 'm not sure 
 you will be worthy of the confidence this institution places in you 
 How many times since you came onto this campus have you heard the role that 
 have you heard the words that the role of the military is changing in the post Cold 
 War years I hope that you do not become numb to the meaning of the changing 
 military role For if your role were not changing if you were not to change and 
 shape change you would not be of the caliber this institution requires 
 There are some things however which do not change no matter what happens 
 Some things do not change High ethical values Duty 
 Honor Country they do not change Your mission statement should be a 
 constant inspiration to you It says in part Each graduate shall have the 
 attributes essential to professional growth throughout a career as an officer of 
 the regular Army Now growth means change Do not fear change Embrace 
 change as part of your mission 
 I know that tradition is very important here at West Point I know you are still 
 being   the methods   sic in the 1820s 
 But do n't make a mistake and somehow equate tradition with fear of change Not 
 so One of your predecessors with whom I work at the LBJ School in Texas told me 
 of a standing joke and I do n't think it 's that funny but he said it 's a joke that 
 West Point represents 193 years of tradition  tradition 
 means a steadfast adherence to the highest ethical standards if tradition means 
 an unfailing dedication to duty if tradition means leadership with character then 
 let tradition continue for another 193 years We need it We need it 
 I know that it was a part of tradition that you would have had a parade for me 
 today And I know that you cadets are troubled and   that 
 opportunity 
 unaccounted for gap in audio 13:15 13:24 
 If you practice the highest ethical standards if you are dedicated to your duty if 
 you lead with character as Sylvanus Thayer taught you will then be able to 
 embrace change without fear Tradition and change are not antithetical If you 
 look at those persons who were honored before me you will see that there is an 
 embodiment a weaving of tradition and an ability to embrace change And by 
 enrolling in at West Point and I hope embracing the traditions of this school 
 that you have accepted a lifetime of public service 
 If you accept that challenge a lifetime of public service you will be held to the 
 higher highest ethical standards of anybody and you should be should be 
 Those who serve should be held to the highest ethical standards because they also 
 have accepted public trust 
 For 193 years that public trust has been well placed West Point is where 
 leadership is born West Point is not just famous names It 's men and women who 
 achieve great things It 's people who built the East West railroads and built the 
 Panama Canal it 's people who figured out how we could go to the moon 
 193 years ago we had just begun this country this grand experiment that we call 
 Democracy and we 're still working on it We 're trying to get our footing We 're 
 just beginning to define our character 193 years ago and West West Point here 
 seeds were planted 
 The men and women of West Point watered our native soil Of course you should 
 not expect that just because you attend this institution that automatically you 're 
 going to achieve some kind of immortality Not every graduate does Like in every 
 great institution in this country not every graduate does Some have not lived up 
 to the principles of their duty their honor or what their country required 
 But there is no system which is perfect and we are all human and we have 
 weaknesses and fears and misfortune There is no formula to guarantee your 
 success But I can assure you if you embrace the heritage here if you go beyond 
 the dictionary definitions of your motto if you take those words place them in 
 your soul in your heart and not just everyday chatter you wo n't need a formula 
 Your West Point education is only the beginning folks But it 's a terrific beginning 
 The idea of service before self becomes ingrained in you here you 'll be given 
 every opportunity to serve 
 You will leave here with the necessary tools to lead this country into the next 
 century And I am convinced that you will do it honor And then things if things 
 get too murky too cloudy too unclear in your future there is always one single 
 imperative beat Navy

145,Ahmed H. Zewail,Commencement Address at Caltech,2011," Thank you Kent 
 I think after what you heard you must be impressed But I trust that you are smart 
 enough to know why I am invited to give your commencement My office is only a 
 few meters from here and it will not cost the Institute any travel expenses but the 
 truth is that it 's only a lunch free lunch today and I expect to get a raise with my 
 salary 
 Chairman Kresa Members of the Board of Trustees President Chameau Former 
 Presidents Baltimore and Everhart Provost Stolper Division Chairs Faculty Vice 
 Presidents Staff Distinguished Guests and above all our Graduates 
 When President Chameau asked me to give this year 's commencement address I 
 was in fact delighted and I am indeed honored to be here today with you your 
 families and our entire Caltech community 
 But what can one say to the very bright graduates of Caltech that will be different 
 from what they already know And if you are like my own children you do not 
 really wish to have a lecture on what you should and should not do 
 So I decided instead to share with you some personal experiences in the hope that 
 you may see why you are fortunate to reach this milestone and to reflect on what 
 you can do with your fortune to forge a new future 
 I speak wearing different hats Like you I have learned a great 
 of the unique academic structure of Caltech As a faculty member and concerned 
 citizen of the world I have also acquired knowledge and hopefully some wisdom 
 about global affairs And perhaps of special importance to today 's celebration is 
 that my own family like yours has witnessed the joy of college graduation 
 Nearly twenty years ago I stood in this very stage and handed my own daughter a 
 Caltech science degree 
 My dear graduates today you will receive a degree but soon you will discover that 
 this special event is only a first step on a long road In fact in many ways today 
 marks a new beginning in your life This rebirth is lauded in a commencement 
 ceremony and the tradition which dates back to the Middle Ages is a service in 
 celebration of and thanksgiving for lives dedicated to learning and wisdom 
 learning you have   light of knowledge and wisdom you 
 have acquired from experience and mentoring with love from your family who 
 supported you throughout your journey 
 I take this opportunity and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the 
 graduates to give a standing ovation to their own parents Will you please stand 
 up and give your parents a standing ovation 
 Please sit down the last stimulus check from your parents will 
 be cashed today 
 You are living in a special age the age of information and you came to Caltech 
 seeking new knowledge Information itself is not necessarily useful knowledge 
 and both information and knowledge are not sufficient to synthesize wisdom One 
 needs a proper education combined with experience and it helps to have of 
 course good genes so try to choose your parents well 
 My message from the outset is simple always be   of knowledge 
 and wisdom to shape your future the future of your country and the future of the 
 world 
 When I came to the United States in 1969 I was not dreaming of a Nobel Prize or 
 a Pulitzer prize nor I was dreaming of acquiring a Bill Gates fortune Armed with 
 the excellent education I received in Egypt I was simply on a quest for knowledge 
 and a Ph.D. degree from a reputable institution in this land of opportunity 
 Incidentally my English was so poor that at restaurants I used to order deserts 
 for desserts 
 America was a magnet for many members of my generation because of its 
 leadership in science and technology and its unique democratic values The 
 historic landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon in 1969 was enough to 
 demonstrate America 's outlook on the new frontiers of knowledge 
 I was aware of Edison 's dictum Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine 
 percent perspiration and I took advantage of being in the right place at the right 
 time of being in America and at Caltech 
 In fact it was Caltech 's ambiance and the country 's system of support that made 
 it possible for a young assistant professor to carry out with his team research 
 that in only ten years time would define a discipline that was recognized by the 
 Nobel Prize in 1999 
 People often ask me How does one get a Nobel Prize and what is the secret of 
 success And incidentally the same people had no interest in asking this question 
 before I received the prize I believe it was passion for science that supplied the 
 energy and it was optimism that made the almost impossible possible 
 My dear graduates success comes to the prepared mind Success is not like rain 
 that falls from the sky equally upon everyone Success is what you reap when you 
 sow with passion and optimism 
 Times have changed The world is more complex and the America of today is not 
 the one I came to in 1969 We are now in the so called global age threatened by 
 chemical biological and nuclear disasters   and the United States faces real 
 challenges the rise of economic super powers such as China and India the 
 conflicts in the world overseas and most importantly in my view the change 
 in cultural educational and political values 
 Yes there are challenges and changes but you can still make your own success in 
 your own way because you are fortunate enough to have received an exceptional 
 education in a twenty first century developed world society 
 Your education is unaffordable to at least eighty percent of the six billion people 
 on the planet who make merely a dollar a day As importantly America continues 
 to provide you with opportunities that even today you will not find anywhere else 
 in the world 
 And here in this country you are free to speak and worship as you please and 
 you can sleep at night without fear of the government or police These 
 fundamental values are embedded in the foundation of this country which is built 
 on pillars of life liberty and pursuit of happiness 
 Our world today is full of opportunities and you the Caltech graduates have a 
 unique role to play because of the special education you received in the sciences 
 and engineering and the rational thinking that this education has instilled in you 
 Do not listen to pessimists rather forge ahead to share your experience in 
 whatever field you are passionate about which could be business government 
 law art or science I do not know the future of business or politics but I know 
 the future of science 
 Your generation and the ones after yours will continue to seek a basic 
 understanding of nature and will make the many exciting discoveries that lie 
 ahead from the deciphering and control of the most fundamental constituents of 
 matter to discoveries at our universe 's boundaries and to the unveiling of our 
 origin and the miracle of life 
 Your generation will also explore other planets and possibly reach out to other 
 galaxies 
 You now sit just a few miles from JPL where Mars Science Laboratory rover is 
 being built for launch in November of this year When the rover named Curiosity 
 lands in August of next year it will perform the first ever precision landing on 
 Mars and help us assess whether the planet can harbor life 
 Beyond these and other intellectual achievements there are direct benefits to 
 peoples liberty From early in history the quest of knowledge has been a driving 
 force of revolutionary change not only causing paradigm shifts in our 
 understanding of the cosmos but also acting as an agent for the naissance and 
 renaissance of human societies 
 The European Renaissance would have been impossible without enlightenment 
 about the significance of knowledge and the rational thinking I think too much 
 credit is given to the impact of politics on the progress of society Without science 
 there is no development and politicians would be unable to promise prosperity 
 Just think What would our world be like without electricity penicillin and the 
 airplane From the agriculture and industrial revolutions to today 's genomics and 
 IT revolutions science is at center stage for societal advancement and Caltech 
 graduates will surely play a leading role in conquering the next frontiers of 
 discovery innovations and progress 
 Even in politics technology is becoming the new weapon for transformative 
 change in society The youth of your generation are now harnessing information 
 technology to do what those of my generation thought impossible 
 Elsewhere in the world there still exists oppression occupation and human 
 suffering and young people are revolting to acquire liberty from repressive 
 regimes The hope I witnessed first hand in Egypt is a telling indication of a new 
 role for science in democracy 
 You are aware no doubt of the peoples revolution sweeping the Middle East as I 
 speak I witnessed in real time the Egyptian uprising that began on January 25th 
 of this year and remarkably led to the removal of Mr. Mubarak in only eighteen 
 days 
 I saw university students in the hundreds of thousands and then people in the 
 millions marching toward Tahrir Square in Cairo The name of the square means 
 liberty and that is precisely what the youth wanted from a thirty year old 
 regime They demonstrated peacefully with impeccable organizational skills and 
 in unison 
 In my generation we would probably have had to use stones sticks and guns in 
 order to rise up in your generation they used Facebook Twitter and SMS 
 Without the development of the chip wireless technology and the Internet this 
 revolution may never have succeeded as a peaceful and civilized transformation 
 Although the road ahead is bumpy I am optimistic that with investment in 
 education and development again through science a democratic Egypt will 
 emerge You may be interested to know that only a few months after the 
 revolution Egypt announced announced the establishment of a New City for 
 Science and Technology on three hundred acres of land and guess which 
 university model will be followed your soon to be alma mater Caltech 's 
 When people in the Middle East ultimately gain their freedom the world will be 
 better off Some scholars argue that the world is destined always to be embroiled 
 in conflicts and wars But this bleak picture is surely not the result of a natural 
 phenomenon 
 We the people cause such conflicts and we the people can either kindle the fire or 
 help to extinguish it The United States can not change the culture of other people 
 and nations are responsible for their own plights but it is the kismet of the United 
 States to lead in the   most valuable force the American value 
 system of individual liberty justice and human rights 
 I believe that much can be achieved   by the strategic use of 
 the real force of America its soft power The soft power of science has the 
 potential to reshape global diplomacy and at significantly lower expense than 
 that needed for use of the hard power of military involvement 
 I am hopeful that a new national policy will be charted for leadership in 
 innovation This policy should be inclusive of international science diplomacy for 
 partnerships in development Some may argue that it is naïve to think of applying 
 such idealistic values in our imperfect world but directing the influence of science 
 diplomacy is in the best interests of the United States 
 Through the power of knowledge we can efface ignorance and shape a future that 
 binds cultures and civilizations In his recent Cairo speech President Barack 
 Obama articulated a new initiative for cooperation and partnership that 
 emphasizes the role of science and diplomacy particularly with the 
 Muslim majority countries 
 Earlier the President appointed me to his Council of Advisors on Science and 
 Technology and later I became U.S. Science Envoy to the Middle East I embarked 
 on a diplomatic mission that took me back to where I came from but now with a 
 different objective From touring and seeing the state of science and education 
 not only in the region but also globally I believe we will face serious 
 consequences if we do not choose to act 
 I recently read an important study that left me   of 
 knowledge across our planet 's population In Educating All Children A Global 
 Agenda Joel Cohen and David Bloom argue that the aim of achieving primary and 
 secondary schooling for all the children is urgent and feasible and yet more than 
 three hundred million children will not be in school in the year 2015 
 Every effort should be made to change this state of affairs so that we may hope for 
 a better future for our world 
 So the twenty first century education that you are fortunate to have received at 
 Caltech is far reaching It reaches beyond the classical boundaries not just 
 across so called interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields but also between 
 nations and maybe soon even across planets 
 Perhaps the best words to describe the value of education and knowledge are 
 those of Thomas Jefferson In 1782 in his Notes on Virginia he wrote 
 The general objects of a bill to diffuse knowledge more generally 
 through the mass of people are to provide them education adapted to 
 the years to the capacity and the condition of everyone and directed to 
 their freedom and happiness.1 
 Remarkably Jefferson more than two centuries ago saw the virtue of education 
 on the individual and global level 
 My dear graduates this commencement is the initial stage of a developmental 
 process It is a beginning of a long voyage In this journey invest your fortune of 
 knowledge wisely and forge your place and time into opportunity Have a dream 
 and work hard to realize that dream as did the great man who spoke these 
 resounding words Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
 Without hard work we are not entitled to a good life and without 
 compassion we will not attain the good life in a world majority 
 population of have nots 
 The investment of your family and your country in you was made for a good 
 reason You need a good education to lead a fuller richer life the country needs 
 you to build its future and the world will be a better place when knowledge 
 replaces ignorance

 Senate President Pence The Majority Leader 
 Senator McConnell I ask unanimous consent the Majority Leader and the 
 Democratic Leader be allowed to speak and that the time not account against two 
 hours of debate in relation to the objection raised on the state of Arizona 
 Senate President Pence Is there objection Without objection so ordered

 every four years for more than two centuries Whether our nation 's been at war or 
 at peace under all manner of threats even during an ongoing armed rebellion and 
 the Civil War the clockwork of our democracy has carried on 
 The United States and the United States Congress have faced down much greater 
 threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today We 've never been deterred before 
 and we 'll be not deterred today They tried to disrupt our democracy they failed 
 They failed They failed to attempt to obstruct the Congress This failed 
 insurrection only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our Republic 
 Our nation was founded precisely so that the free choice of the American people is 
 what shapes our self government and determines the destiny of our nation

 Now we assembled this afternoon to count our citizens votes and to formalize 
 their choice of the next President Now we 're going to finish what we started 
 We 'll complete the process the right  We 'll follow our precedents 
 our laws and our Constitution to the letter And we will certify the winner of the 
 2020 presidential election

147,Susan Rice,George Washington University Speech on U.S.-China Relations,2015," Good morning everyone   Thank you President Knapp for that kind introduction 
 and thank you to everyone at GW for hosting me   I wanted to come to this 
 distinguished university to speak directly to younger people because my topic this 
 morning will impact your futures whether you decide to open a business 
 develop cutting edge internet technology or work in national security   That ’s the 
 relationship between China and the United States the most consequential in the 
 world today 
 But allow me to start with a little bit of history 
 There is special news this afternoon you are lost 
 That was how Zhou En Lai greeted Henry Kissinger at their now famous meeting 
 in Beijing on July 9 1971   The trip was a closely guarded secret   No one knew 
 where Kissinger was he had feigned an illness and decamped from a Pakistani 
 airfield in the dead of night for face to face talks with the Chinese   He did n’t even 
 pack a clean shirt for his 48 hour mission   But that first meeting between 
 President Nixon ’s National Security Advisor and Chairman Mao ’s Prime Minister led 
 directly to the first S. President to China and the opening of relations 
 between our nations a trip that was dubbed the week that changed the world 
 Over the past four decades we ’ve seen how prescient that assessment was 
 I recently returned from my own visit to China my third since becoming National 
 Security Advisor   None of mine had to be secret   I always brought clean clothes 
 On each visit I met with President Xi and China ’s top leadership conveying 
 President Obama ’s personal commitment to advancing the relationship between 
 our countries while candidly addressing our differences   On my last trip in late 
 August I spent more than eight hours in intensive discussions with my Chinese 
 counterpart and many more with other senior officials discussing our nations 
 priorities our expectations of one another and our visions for the future where 
 they overlap and how we will handle disagreements 
 President Obama will continue our frank and comprehensive discussions when he 
 welcomes President Xi to the White House later this week for a State Visit   Over 
 the past two years President Xi and President Obama have spent many hours 
 meeting in formal and informal settings as well as communicating through phone 
 calls and letters because many global challenges today can only be met with 
 China and the United States working in concert 
 It can be easy to lose sight of the larger arc of progress in our bilateral 
 relationship with China amid the headlines that understandably focus on the 
 differences between our countries   Our differences and America ’s concerns are 
 real   At the same time it ’s important to recognize the long term trends that 
 increasingly anchor this complex relationship   So today I ’d like to speak about 
 how the United States approaches China how far we ’ve come and how we view 
 the future we want to build together 
 Let me start with the broader context   Pursuing a productive relationship with 
 China is a critical element of our larger strategy for the Asia Pacific   The United 
 States is a Pacific power   We ’ve been the guarantor of stability in the region for 
 the past 70 years   President Obama has made it clear that we have vital interests 
 in Asia and the Pacific and a good part of our foreign policy has been focused on 
 our rebalance to Asia the President ’s commitment to expand America ’s 
 engagement in this region which had waned under the strain of wars in Iraq and 
 Afghanistan   Our determination to shape the future of this dynamic region 
 continues to benefit the Asia Pacific today enhancing security expanding 
 prosperity and advancing human dignity 
 America ’s unmatched leadership is grounded in our treaty alliances with Japan 
 South Korea Australia the Philippines and Thailand   We ’ve modernized these 
 essential partnerships to tackle a full range of regional and global challenges 
 from providing humanitarian assistance to fighting pandemic disease   We ’ve 
 strengthened our defense posture in the region to ensure our collective security 
 including new access agreements to rotate U.S. forces to Australia and the 
 Philippines   These alliances rooted in our shared values are powerful platforms 
 for advancing a rules based international system   The work of keeping our 
 alliances strong and prepared for the future is never done which is why President 
 Obama welcomed Prime Minister Abe of Japan for a State Visit in April and in the 
 coming weeks he will host President Park of South Korea 
 At the same time we ’re building productive new partnerships with emerging 
 regional powers   We ’re engaging vital voices like India in regional discussions 
 and in the last year Prime Minister Modi and President Obama have exchanged 
 formal visits to deepen the relationship between our two great democracies 
 We ’ve overcome past conflicts and are strengthening cooperation as when 
 President Obama welcomed Vietnam ’s General Secretary Truong to the Oval Office 
 this summer   We ’ve explored an opening to Burma and will continue to press for 
 follow through on the democratic reforms that have been initiated there as the 
 country prepares for a landmark election   And we ’re collaborating with regional 
 leaders to advance our shared agenda as we will when President Widodo of 
 Indonesia visits Washington next month 
 We ’re also investing in regional institutions like the Pacific Islands Forum as well 
 as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN the Asia Pacific Economic 
 Cooperation APEC and the East Asia Summit EAS   President Obama is the first 
 U.S. President to help shape this architecture of cooperation in the region through 
 sustained personal engagement at these regional summits   In November 
 President Obama will again travel to Asia to the Philippines and Malaysia to 
 participate in APEC and EAS   Through our active involvement in all these 
 institutions we ’re promoting regional growth and economic integration   We ’ve 
 helped strengthen their capacity to resolve conflicts support democratic 
 development advance human rights and ensure that all countries in the region 
  rules 
 That ’s especially important for spurring broad based economic growth in the 
 fastest growing region in the world   The landmark Trans Pacific Partnership that 
 we ’re working to conclude will unlock greater trade and investment among 
 countries in the region while raising standards for worker rights environmental 
 safeguards and intellectual property protections   It will bring us closer to our 
 allies and partners demonstrating our commitment to a shared future   We ’re 
 working now to complete negotiations for TPP so that we level the playing field for 
 American businesses and workers 
 It is against this backdrop as President Obama has often said that the United 
 States welcomes a rising China that is peaceful stable prosperous and a 
 responsible player in global affairs   It ’s natural that China take on greater 
 leadership to match its economic development and growing capabilities   When 
 China is invested in helping resolve regional and global problems the United 
 States and the world benefits   We also recognize that China has prospered 
 within a secure environment and international economic system that depends 
 upon the United States long standing commitments to the region   And we will 
 continue taking steps to build a productive cooperative relationship with China 
 that delivers benefits for both our peoples   That ’s a central pillar of our strategy 
 in Asia 
 Under President Obama ’s leadership we have deepened our engagement with 
 China at every level maximizing our cooperation on areas of mutual interest 
 while confronting and managing our disagreements   We reject reductive 
 reasoning and lazy rhetoric that says conflict between the U.S. and China is 
 inevitable even as we ’ve been tough with China where we disagree   This is n’t a 
 zero sum game   Our capacity to manage our differences is greater than that 
 The United States comes to this relationship as an unquestionably strong player 
 an historic and enduring global leader with a resurgent economy and a diverse 
 and innovative people and we welcome a China that joins in upholding the 
 rules based order that has served both our nations so well for so long   We invite 
 China to work with us to adapt existing regional and international institutions so 
 they are better able to address current realities   That ’s why President Obama 
 elevated the G-20 to be the premier forum for global economic cooperation   And 
 that ’s why we ’re committed to passing legislation to implement International 
 Monetary Fund reforms so that fast growing nations including China can 
 contribute more to the international financial system 
 Deeper engagement between our countries yields dividends for both Americans 
 and Chinese   Since President Obama took office our exports to China have nearly 
 doubled and China is now the third largest market for American made goods 
 following Canada and Mexico   Over that same period Chinese investment in the 
 United States surged from just about $ 1 billion to more than $ 10 billion 
 We ’ve extended visas for travel between our countries for business people 
 students and tourists making it easier for our citizens to study and work 
 together   We ’ve increased the number of visas we issue to Chinese travelers 
 from less than half a million in 2009 to more than 1.7 million last year   And that ’s 
 important because the average Chinese tourist contributes more than $ 7,000 to 
 the U.S. economy when they visit   That adds up 
 As two nations that will shape the direction of this century we want our young 
 people to learn together and develop early connections so we ’re encouraging 
 student exchanges and study abroad   Today there are almost 275,000 Chinese 
 students studying in the United States up from less than 100,000 in 2009    And 
 we ’ve already exceeded President Obama ’s goal of sending 100,000 Americans to 
 study in China   We look forward to setting an ambitious new target during 
 President Xi ’s visit and continuing to strengthen our people to people ties 
 Since creating our Strategic and Economic Dialogue with China in 2009 we ’ve 
 used that forum to find new areas for practical cooperation on global issues   This 
 summer at the seventh session we committed to strengthening our cooperation 
 on everything from disaster response to combatting wildlife trafficking to 
 establishing civilian cooperation in space 
 We ’re also working together to advance our shared security   During the past five 
 years we ’ve bolstered our military to military ties with China   We ’ve increased 
 military exchanges and made high level visits a regular occurrence   China now 
 participates in our multilateral RIMPAC exercise the largest naval exercise in the 
 world   And last year when President Obama visited China we agreed to institute 
 confidence building measures between our militaries that increase transparency 
 and predictability thereby reducing the risk of unintended incidents   We ’ve seen 
 a marked improvement in operational safety since we signed these measures and 
 believe this engagement is critical to avoid inadvertent escalation while 
 promoting constructive cooperation 
 China has been a constructive partner in advancing the non proliferation agenda 
 supporting efforts to secure nuclear materials and drive global action through the 
 Nuclear Security Summits   Most recently we ’ve worked through the P5 + 1 to 
 ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon   China and the United States 
 are in firm agreement that a nuclear armed Iran would pose an unacceptable 
 threat to the world and we cooperated to build and enforce a tough sanctions 
 regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table   China voluntarily agreed to 
 reduce their purchases of Iranian oil to build pressure   And now that we have a 
 deal we will coordinate closely with China and all our partners to ensure Iran 
 meets its commitments 
 China and the United States are equally united in demanding the complete and 
 verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula   We firmly oppose North 
 Korea ’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that threaten 
 regional stability and our respective national security interests   China is a fulcrum 
 of influence for the DPRK and this week ’s meetings between Presidents Obama 
 and Xi will be another opportunity to discuss how we can sharpen Pyongyang ’s 
 choices between having nuclear weapons and developing economically   Neither 
 the United States nor China will accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state 
 In recent years we ’ve expanded our cooperation with China to increase stability 
 and spur economic growth in Afghanistan   We ’re investing in Afghanistan ’s 
 development and supporting efforts to advance an Afghan led peace process   Our 
 joint programs train Afghan diplomats health care workers and farmers and 
 we ’re doing more to embed Afghanistan into regional institutions and economic 
 systems and to increase its resilience to threats 
 As the two largest consumers of energy and the two largest carbon emitters in the 
 world our cooperation on climate change is vital to the security and the prosperity 
 of our world   Here China and the United States are taking decisive action   We ’ve 
 built an unprecedented bilateral partnership to drive down carbon emissions and 
 promote clean energy in key sectors including power generation and industry 
 transportation and forestry   Through initiatives like the Clean Energy Research 
 Center we ’re jointly developing solutions to improve energy efficiency in 
 buildings advance electric vehicle technology and explore carbon capture   And 
 last year President Obama and President Xi made an historic announcement in 
 Beijing committing our countries to cut carbon emissions and meet ambitious 
 climate targets the first time that China has ever agreed to reduce its emissions 
 Both leaders are personally committed to ensuring that the world agrees to a 
 strong comprehensive climate agreement in Paris this December   This is an 
 example to the world of how sustained U.S.-China engagement can yield historic 
 results to meet the challenges of the 21st century 
 We ’ve also seen impressive evidence of the difference China and the United States 
 can make when we work together to lift up the lives of people in other countries 
 At the peak of the Ebola crisis in West Africa America ’s leadership along with the 
 contributions of international partners helped beat back a devastating epidemic 
 American and Chinese healthcare workers labored  save lives 
 Moving forward the U.S. and China will help Africa set up its own Center for 
 Disease Control   To prepare for future epidemics we ’ll work closely with China to 
 jointly advance our shared Global Health Security Agenda 
 So we are steadily and methodically expanding the breadth and depth of our 
 cooperation with China   Our story is overwhelmingly one of progress   Still the 
 reality is we face difficult challenges   And we never shy away from pressing our 
 concerns 
 In our interconnected global economy American companies and workers can 
 compete and succeed anywhere   But the competition must be fair   When China ’s 
 economic policies impede the free flow of commerce and worsen trade imbalances 
 it distorts the global economy   When China forces firms to hand over their 
 technology as a condition for market access it discourages innovation   When 
 American businesses increasingly question whether the cost of doing business in 
 China is worth it that reduces trade and investment for everyone and undercuts 
 the support for the U.S.-China relationship here at home   And as the world ’s 
 second largest economy China ’s actions reverberate through the global financial 
 markets as we saw recently with China ’s stock market 
 So we want China to advance market reforms that level the playing field for 
 foreign firms reduce barriers to trade and unleash its massive domestic 
 consumer potential   China ’s economy has gotten too big to rely on an 
 export driven growth strategy   And we ’ll continue to insist that China refrain 
 from competitive currency devaluation   We want a future where businesses in 
 China succeed or fail on their merits without discriminatory subsidies or markets 
 that are closed to competition   We want a business climate where intellectual 
 property rights and trade secrets are respected not stolen 
 In his meetings with President Xi President Obama has repeatedly made plain 
 that state sponsored cyber enabled economic espionage must stop   This is n’t a 
 mild irritation   It is an economic and national security concern to the United 
 States   It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship and it is a critical 
 factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties   Cyber enabled 
 espionage that targets personal and corporate information for the economic gain 
 of businesses undermines our long term economic cooperation and it needs to 
 stop   So we ’ll continue to urge China to join us in promoting responsible norms of 
 state behavior in cyberspace 
 We ’ve also made clear our position on maritime disputes in the East and South 
 China Seas   The United States takes no position on competing territorial claims 
 but we insist upon and will continue to underscore our fundamental national 
 interest in preserving freedom of navigation and commerce through some of the 
 world ’s busiest sea lanes   The United States of America will sail fly and operate 
 anywhere that international law permits 
 We have an interest in preventing territorial disputes from growing into larger 
 conflicts that destabilize the region   The G-7 and ASEAN share our concerns and 
 we will work with all our partners to establish a peaceful process based in 
 international law for resolving maritime claims with diplomacy not force or 
 coercion   We call on all claimants to reciprocally halt land reclamation 
 construction of new facilitates and militarization of outposts on disputed areas 
 Instead we urge China and ASEAN countries to conclude a Code of Conduct and 
 set clear predictable binding rules of the road in the South China Sea 
 We also have candid exchanges on Taiwan   The longstanding position of the 
 United States is unchanged   We remain committed to our one China policy 
 based on the three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act   Our 
 fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross Strait relations and we 
 oppose unilateral changes to the status 
 Another profound difference between our two governments is human rights 
 Around the world the United States never backs away from difficult issues   With 
 China we speak openly about persistent human rights violations pressing our 
 concerns at every level   We raise the cases of individuals like Liu Xiaobo Xu 
 Zhiyong Gao Yu Ilham Tohti and Pu Zhiqiang who are unjustly detained   China ’s 
 increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly including their 
 visa restrictions on American journalists are not only wrong they are 
 short sighted   They hollow out China ’s potential   Already the environment for 
 civil society organizations is so repressive that many groups are heading 
 elsewhere   The draft foreign NGO law that China is considering would be another 
 step in the wrong direction threatening the very organizations that have 
 promoted China ’s development and advanced the friendship between our peoples 
 Denying ethnic minorities like Tibetans and Uighurs their fundamental freedoms 
 or closing churches and removing crosses or placing restrictions on who can enter 
 a mosque these actions only fuel grievances and raise serious questions about 
 China ’s commitment to protecting freedom of religion   Detaining lawyers and 
 journalists and anti corruption activists only reduces the credibility of China ’s 
 efforts to address its challenges hampering its ability to achieve a prosperous and 
 stable society   Blocking free access to the Internet at a time when the rest of the 
 world is moving toward greater openness and connection only cuts off 
 opportunities for the Chinese people to advance 
 I raise each of these issues in my meetings with Chinese leaders and I say the 
 same thing to my counterparts that I have said to you   As my critics allege I am 
 rather direct   I assure you that President Obama will be just as direct when he 
 sees President Xi   This is a vital relationship of the 21st century and we have to 
 be upfront about our differences because they are preventing us from reaching 
 the full potential of our cooperation 
 Many of our concerns stem from a common root   Steps that erode the 
 international system or that slowly eat away at a rules based order and universal 
 rights or that give one nation an unfair advantage are detrimental to all   This is 
 true whether we are talking about maritime concerns or cyberspace or human 
 rights   China can not expect to wield influence selectively or lead only when it ’s 
 convenient opting in or out of international norms at will   Everyone has to play by 
 the same rules regardless of size or power because that ’s the way everyone can 
 compete and be treated equally 
 I know that some people question why we host China at all   That is a dangerous 
 and short sighted view   If we sought to punish   or 
 refusing to engage them we would only be punishing ourselves   It is determined 
 constant engagement that allowed us to reach a climate agreement while 
 overcoming long standing trade disputes   And determined constant engagement 
 is necessary to manage our differences   If America chose to remove itself from 
 China we would only ensure that the Chinese are not challenged on the issues 
 where we differ and are not encouraged to peacefully rise within the international 
 system that we have done so much to build 
 We want the Chinese people to succeed   When China and the United States work 
 together the world is more secure and more prosperous   That ’s the truth   But 
 success is n’t winning at all costs or getting ahead at the expense of others   In this 
 century success is   you draw together through 
 principled leadership   It ’s growing your economy while giving everyone an equal 
 chance to compete   It ’s tapping the talents of all your 
 space for them to contribute not shrinking it   It ’s applying your strength to 
 reinforce international norms not to revise them   And when we welcome 
 President Xi we will continue exploring practical ways to advance our agenda for 
 shared success 
 At that first secret meeting back in 1971 Henry Kissinger delivered a message 
 about how the United States came to the table with China   We consider he said 
 that China must participate on the basis of equality in all matters affecting the 
 peace of Asia and the peace of the world   We consider it in our interest and above 
 all in the interest of the world that you play your appropriate role in shaping 
 international arrangements 
 That bottom line continues to hold true today   Perhaps more than ever it is in our 
 interest for China to participate and play an active and responsible role on the 
 global stage because the futures of our two nations the futures of people 
 around the world grow more deeply    In the coming 
 decades strong and wise American leaders must necessarily maintain a 
 relationship with China that promotes cooperation while allowing for healthy 
 competition 
 China and the United States can do great things together   We have unmatched 
 resources and unique capabilities to address global challenges   The real points of 
 friction between us can not be papered over and we will continue to deal 
 forthrightly with our differences   But this relationship is too big and too 
 important to treat with anything less than our full good faith effort   And you can 
 be sure that our relationship with China one that is stable productive and 
 resilient will remain at the center of American foreign policy for years to come

 glib clichés which for too long have been an accepted part of our political life 
 I am the candidate of the people of America And my presence before you now 
 symbolizes a new era in American political history I have always earnestly 
 believed in the great potential of America Our constitutional democracy will soon 
 celebrate its 200th anniversary effective testimony to the longevity of our 
 cherished Constitution and its unique Bill of Rights which continues to give to the 
 world its inspirational message of freedom and liberty 
 We Americans are a dynamic people because of our rugged individuality and our 
 cherished diversity because of our belief in human dignity because of our 
 generosity and good will to our fellow man and most importantly because of 
 our tradition of moving forward forward to actively confront those problems 
 which plague us in a world growing more complex each year 
 Like all human beings we have made mistakes Our involvement in Vietnam was 
 and remains at this very moment a terrible tragedy To have intervened in the civil 
 war in that country and then later to have intervened in still two more countries 
 Laos and Cambodia was an ill conceived blunder whose consequences all of us 
 have had to suffer To leave our men there or to increase massive bombing in the 
 process of withdrawing them is to compound the havoc and misery which we are 
 inflicting on the peoples of Indochina on our own young men who have been 
 killed and mutilated and rendered drug addicts and ourselves ourselves whose 
 hard earned has during a serious economic recession made up the billions of 
 dollars spent in Vietnam when we so urgently needed these resources at home 
 During last year 1971 more civilians were killed and wounded in Indochina and 
 many more made refugees than at any time in our history And Vietnam continues 
 to cost us one million dollars a day this despite President Nixon 's promise four 
 years ago to end this nightmare 
 Our unique economic system has made America the wealthiest nation in history 
 Yet we have undergone another economic recession in which millions of 
 Americans have lost their jobs and are unable to find work the highest number 
 in ten years And at the same time prices have soared on even the essentials of 
 life food clothing and medical care 
 And beyond Vietnam and its horrors which have dominated our newspapers and 
 television[s for eight long years and beyond the economic recession which has 
 caused severe hardship at home to so many Americans is the visible ongoing 
 destruction of our natural environment and our loss of a sense of personal 
 security in our own daily lives 
 Perhaps even more fundamental is our loss of the feeling of community shock at 
 the continuing injustices and inequities in the land that we love   our suspicions of 
 pervasive constitutional incompetence and corruption our feeling that there 's an 
 absence of respectable authority in our nation and our loss of confidence in 
 ourselves with apathy or despair arising from the conviction that we are 
 powerless to make ourselves heard or felt in remedying our ills 
 Fellow Americans we have looked in vain to the Nixon Administration for the 
 courage the spirit the character and the words to lift us to bring out the best in 
 us to rekindle in each of us our faith in the American Dream.1 Yet all that we 
 have received in return is just another smooth exercise in political manipulation 
 deceit and deception callousness and indifference to our individual problems and 
 the disgusting playing of divisive politics pinning the young against the old 
 labor against management North against South black against white.2 
 The abiding concern of this Administration has been one of political expediency 
 rather than the needs of man 's nature The President has broken his promises to 
 us and has therefore lost his claim to our trust and confidence in him 
 I can not believe I can not believe that this Administration would have ever been 
 elected four years ago if we had known then what we know today that we are 
 entering we are entering a new era in which we must as Americans demand 
 stature and size in our national leadership leadership leadership which is 
 fresh leadership which is open and leadership which is receptive to the problems 
 of all Americans 
 I have faith in the American people I believe that we are smart enough to correct 
 our mistakes I believe we are intelligent enough to recognize the talent energy 
 and dedication which all Americans including women and minorities have to 
 offer 
 I know from my travels to the cities and small towns of America that we have a 
 vast potential which can and must be put to constructive use in getting this great 
 nation together 
 I know that millions of Americans from all walks of life agree with me that 
 leadership does not mean putting the ear to the ground to follow public opinion 
 but to have the vision of what is necessary and the courage to make it possible 
  or intimidation  and law 
 We must turn away from the control of the prosaic the privilege[d and the 
 old line tired politicians to open our society to the energies and abilities of 
 countless new kinds of groups of Americans women blacks browns Indians 
 Orientals and youth so that they can develop their own full potential and thereby 
 participate equally and enthusiastically in building a strong and just society rich 
 rich in its diversity and noble in its quality of life 
 I stand before you today to repudiate the ridiculous notion that the American 
 people will not vote for a qualified qualified candidate simply because he is not 
 white or because she 's not a male I do not believe that in 1972 the great 
 majority of Americans will continue to harbor such narrow and petty prejudices I 
 am convinced that the American people are in a mood to discard the politics and 
 the political personalities of the past I believe that they will show in 1972 and 
 thereafter that they intend to make independent judgments on the merits of a 
 particular candidate based on that candidate 's intelligence character physical 
 ability competence integrity and honesty 
 It is It is I feel the duty of responsibility leaders of this country to encourage 
 and maximize not to dismiss or minimize such judgment Americans all over 
 are demanding a new sensibility a new philosophy of government from 
 Washington 
 Instead of sending spies to snoop on participants at Earth Day I would welcome 
 the efforts of concerned citizens of all ages to stop the abuse of our environment 
 Instead of watching a football game on television while young people beg for the 
 attention of their President concerning our actions abroad I would encourage 
 them to speak out organize for peaceful change and vote in November 
 Instead of blocking efforts to control the huge amounts of money given political 
  and the powerful I would provide certain limits on such 
 amounts and encourage all the people of this nation to contribute small sums to 
 the candidates of their choice 
 Instead of calculating the political costs of this or that policy and of weighing 
 favors of this or that group depending on whether that group voted for me in 
 1968 I would remind all Americans at this hour of the words of Abraham Lincoln 
 A house divided against itself can not stand ""3 
 We Americans We Americans are all fellow countrymen one day confronting the 
 judgment of history in our country We are all God 's children and the will of each 
 of us is as precious as the will of the most powerful General or corporate 
 millionaire 
 Our will our will can create a new American in 1972 one where there 's freedom 
 from violence and war at home and abroad where there 's freedom from poverty 
 and discrimination where there exists at least a feeling that we are making 
 progress and assurance for everyone medical care employment and decent 
 housing where we more decisively clean up our streets our water and our air 
 where we work together black and white to rebuild our neighborhoods and to 
 make our cities quiet attractive and efficient and fundamentally where we live 
 in the confidence that every man and every woman in America has at long last the 
 opportunity to become all that he was created of being such as his ability 
 In conclusion all of you who share this vision from New York to California from 
 Wisconsin to Florida are brothers and sisters on the road to national unity and a 
 new America   Those of you Those of you who were locked outside of the 
 convention hall in 1968 those of you who can now vote for the first time those of 
 you who agree with me that the institutions of this country belong to all of the 
 people who inhabit it those of you who have been neglected left out ignored 
 forgotten or shunned aside for whatever reason Give me your help at this hour 
 Join me in an effort to reshape our society and regain control of our destiny as we 
 go down the Chisholm Trail for 1972",0.0180601682513952,0.0956406667828559,0.6035030484199524,0.0047719264402985,0.0503403134644031,0.2247016280889511,0.0029822846408933,0.0898939561730259,0.465522752441357,34.57568119858993,0.3780260707635009,0.01347978032950574,0.11602870813397129,0.06786315199102635,41.729166666666664,0.0
149,Antony J. Blinken,On Transatlantic Cooperation and the Crisis in Ukraine,2015," Dean Henrik Enderlein thank you for a wonderful introduction Even if a 
 little exaggerated it was deeply appreciated And Wolfgang 
 Ischinger] it ’s a great pleasure to have this excuse to get together with 
 you and to see you We go back to the 1990s when I served in the Clinton 
 Administration and Wolfgang was performing truly heroic service not only 
 for his country but for the entire international community in the Balkans 
 among other places And I remember that very well And in fact I 
 remember dining in your home with one of my predecessors in this job 
 Strobe Talbott some some years ago Since then we ’ve had the great 
 opportunity to work together on other things including Wehrkunde So I ’m 
 grateful to to have you here 
 We have a television show that I think is broadcast in Germany occasionally The 
 David Letterman Show And a couple of nights after that photograph was taken 
 and published David Letterman had as a guest the then Chairman of our Joint 
 Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen And he pulled up the photograph and he pointed at me 
 in the background and he said to Mullen Who is that guy He obviously does n’t 
 belong in the photograph Did he just come in off the tour of the White House?”1 
 And Admiral Mullen my great friend just laughed and did n’t say anything So I 
 have fond memories of that putting me in my in my place 
 I ’m I 'm grateful today also to be   from Washington 
 including our Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and also a great 
 embassy team including our DCM Deputy Chief of Mission Jim Melville who is 
 doing a remarkable job Ambassador John B. Emerson is back in the United 
 States otherwise he ’d be here today But I ’m grateful to have Jim and the team 
 with me 
 And this has been the tail end now of a very productive trip that ’s taken place over 
 the course of the last week 
 You ’ll You 'll understand that Americans sometimes are accused of not 
 understanding Europe or its   of the trip It started in 
 Paris it went to Moldova then it went to London then to Berlin and tomorrow to 
 Kyiv So that does n’t make a lot of sense but somehow we ’ve pulled it together 
 And it ’s been a very interesting trip A lot of focus on Ukraine which is what I 
 want to talk about today but every other issue under the sun And here in 
 Germany in particular what ’s striking to me especially thinking back even to the 
 very productive work we did in the 1990s is that at no time in my experience has 
 the relationship with Germany and the United States covered more issues around 
 the world covered them in a deeper fashion and covered them in a more 
 collaborative fashion than we ’re doing today It is truly extraordinary and I have 
 to tell you the United States is grateful for this partnership President Obama is 
 particularly grateful for his partnership with Chancellor Merkel I know the 
 Secretary of State feels the same way about his partnership with the Foreign 
 Minister 
 I ’m very honored to be here at the Hertie School And it has literally become a 
 mainstay of European policy analysis in a very short period of time And Dean and 
 I were talking about this This is becoming in our parlance the Kennedy School 
 of Germany and that ’s extraordinary 
 In many ways I think what we ’re seeing here is in your great diversity in your 
 engagement almost a a practical symbol of the thriving transatlantic 
 community It ’s a community whose essential character is defined 
 language or culture or religion or ethnicity   embrace of basic 
 values democracy the rule of law the dignity of every human being These are 
 values that we strive to live up to We do n’t always succeed but we ’re constantly 
 trying 
 And these are values that are being tested right now as Russian aggression 
 engulfs Eastern Ukraine and imperils the hope of a Europe whole free and at 
 peace This crisis that we face in Ukraine today not only challenges this great 
 European construction project In my judgment and this is why we care so much 
 about it it also threatens the governing principles of the international order that 
 we all have a stake in defending 
 If you go back 14 months people took to the streets in Kyiv and other parts of 
 Ukraine to demand an end to corruption and to insist that their leaders make good 
 on a promise they had just broken to give Ukraine a European future That ’s what 
 was happening on the Euro]maidan These were not anarchists These were not 
 fascists These were regular citizens students business owners veterans 
 grandmothers The government responded with violence with beatings with 
 snipers that killed more than a hundred people 
 Working with Germany working with France working with the United Kingdom 
 the United States helped to broker talks between President Viktor Yanukovych 
 and the opposition and also with Russia And they led to a deal that would have 
 ended the violence allowed Yanukovych to stay on for some period of time until 
 elections could take place But Yanukovych fled having forfeited his legitimacy 
 and indeed lost the support of his own party Western oriented reformers filled 
 the void pursuant to the constitution and with the overwhelming support of 
 Yanukovych ’s party to try and make good on the promise of the Maidan 
 President Putin saw Ukraine slipping from Russian influence He manufactured a 
 reverse Maidan in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine inventing separatism There was 
 almost nothing spontaneous or indigenous about it And so even as Ukraine began 
 building a peaceful democratic independent nation on 93 percent of its territory 
 Crimea and parts of Eastern Ukraine suffered under a reign of aggression and 
 violence Today Crimea remains under illegal occupation and human rights abuses 
 are the norm not the exception for many at risk groups Crimean Tatars 
 Ukrainians who wo n’t give up their passports lesbian and gay citizens and others 
 And of course in eastern Ukraine it ’s true citizens there before the crisis wanted 
 more direct control over their daily lives and they wanted respect for Russian 
 culture and Russian language But think about it Before the crisis there was no 
 violence in eastern Ukraine The government was not abusing the fundamental 
 rights of its citizens Indeed ethnic Russians in the Donbass enjoyed more rights 
 and freedoms than most ethnic Russians in Russia 
 Moscow and self appointed separatist leaders who were Russian national[ists 
 manufactured a crisis broke the peace and unleashed what fast became a reign of 
 terror 
 seizing government buildings 
 cowing the local populace 
 shooting at police who could not shoot back 
 downing MH-17 a civilian airliner 
 holding sham elections 
 taking over the border between Russia and Ukraine 
 pouring thousands of Russian heavy weapons into Ukraine and troops 
 fueling the conflict 
 repeatedly violating ceasefires that were unilaterally declared by 
 Ukraine and killing Ukrainian soldiers 
 obliterating the Donetsk Airport 
 taking hundreds of hostages including to this day Nadiya Savchenko 
 a Ukrainian pilot kidnapped from Ukraine and who languishes in a 
 Moscow jail on day 84 of a hunger strike 
 expanding their territorial   a thousand square 
 kilometers after the first Minsk Accord was signed last September 
 beyond the line of control that had been established 
 and more recently seizing Debaltseve a key rail hub beyond the 
 ceasefire lines six days after the Minsk implementation plan was 
 agreed and following a vicious assault that resulted in over 500 deaths 
 according to the United Nations 
 So that ’s what ’s largely happened over the past year on one side of the equation 
 What has been the response from Kyiv 
 Well despite the conflict the government has worked very hard to forge a new 
 and better future It signed the Association Agreement with the European Union 
 It held free and fair elections not once but twice under siege and producing for 
 whatever its deficiencies probably the best government that Ukraine has had 
 since its independence It ’s been working to undertake deep and comprehensive 
 economic and political reforms 
 These include laws to enhance transparency in public procurement to reduce the 
 government inefficiency and corruption to clean up Ukraine ’s energy sector to 
 make the banking system more transparent and measures to improve the climate 
 for business and attract foreign investment to create a new anti corruption 
 agency to strengthen the prosecutor general ’s office And today as we speak the 
 Rada is also moving forward on political decentralization to give Ukraine ’s regions 
 more authority in advance of local elections that under the Minsk Implementation 
 Plan are to be held in October So the Ukrainians are trying despite the incredibly 
 difficult environment in which they ’re living 
 What has our response been The United States Germany our European partners 
 Well throughout we ’ve tried to do four things We ’ve tried to support Ukraine with 
 economic assistance security assistance and other support We ’ve worked to 
 reassure our NATO allies who have been deeply concerned by Russia ’s actions in 
 Ukraine We have sought to impose costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine And 
 we have worked to pursue diplomacy which remains the only sustainable answer 
 to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine 
 In terms of support for Ukraine as you know there have been IMF International 
 Monetary Fund packages worth well over 20 billion dollars to help keep reform on 
 track because they ’re conditioned to keep the borders protected the energy 
 section functioning the economy afloat The United States itself has provided 
 recently one billion dollars in a loan guarantee with another billion on the way if 
 the reforms continue We in the United States have worked to help Ukraine defend 
 itself with more than 120 million dollars in security assistance including things 
 like protective vests night vision goggles counter battery radars explosive 
 ordnance disposal robots and so on 
 In terms of our reassurance to NATO we 've worked very closely with our key 
 partners investing money but also working to create a virtually constant land 
 sea and air presence in the front line states since the crisis erupted We impose 
 costs on Russia which I ’ll come back to to try and convince Putin to change 
 course And let me be very clear about this because it ’s important The purpose of 
 that response was not to weaken Russia was not to foment a Color Revolution 
 was not to topple Vladimir Putin but simply to persuade Russia to cease its 
 aggression in Ukraine 
 Now as you all know very very well competing narratives have emerged between 
 Russia and the United States and Europe and the West about what ’s happened 
 over the last 15 or 20 years and what our intentions are and are not And there ’s 
 clearly a Russian narrative that we are out to diminish Russia we ’re out to 
 encircle it we ’re out to contain it and we ’re out to as I said even to foment a 
 color revolution And I understand looking at things from a Russian perspective 
 that certain things have happened over the last 20 years that could feed that 
 perception Arguably NATO enlargement could I would argue that it should be 
 seen in another way but I understand how Russians can see that pulling out of 
 the ABM Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty I certainly understand how that could 
 create such an impression in Russia 
 But the fact is over the last 20 years we collectively in the United States and in 
 Europe have tried to do just the opposite We ’ve tried to bring Russia in We ’ve 
 tried to integrate Russia into the international system We invited them to join 
 the Partnership for Peace in 1994 the Council of Europe in 1996 the NATO Russia 
 Founding Act in 1999[7 the Charter for European Security the OSCE 
 Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe again in 1999 and most 
 recently President Obama was Russia ’s greatest champion to get into the World 
 Trade Organization And of course in the United States alone we ’ve spent over 20 
 billion dollars since 1991 in support to Russia for non proliferation for the 
 economy for free media and so forth 
 So it ’s true we have these competing and different narratives but from our 
 perspective we have sought very hard and strongly to bring Russia in Wolfgang 
 will remember this well The first Munich Security Conference that our 
 Administration was able to take part in in 2009 was the one that Vice President 
 Biden attended And it was at that conference in February 2009 that he gave what 
 was really the first foreign policy speech of the Obama Administration and set out 
 the reset policy with Russia And he made very clear that we sought to strengthen 
 our foundation of cooperation with Russia which had eroded in the previous 
 years 
 And that ’s exactly what we did And there were some very concrete important 
 results including the work that we did on the New START Strategic Arms 
 Reduction Treaty Agreement including work that we did together in Afghanistan 
 including something that lasts to this day real cooperation in working to convince 
 Iran to foreswear nuclear weapons And we were I think hopeful that we could 
 move the relationship forward in a concrete way that advanced our interests and 
 advanced Russia ’s interests and advanced Europe ’s interests 
 But it ’s interesting what got the headlines from that speech was the reset What 
 some people missed in the speech was the Vice President saying very clearly even 
 as we pursue a reset with Russia we have certain basic principles upon which we 
 will not compromise We do not accept the proposition that spheres of influence 
 are a relevant way of doing business in the 21st century and we stand strongly 
 for the proposition that a democratic country has the right to choose its own 
 future and to choose with whom it will associate And we wo n’t compromise on 
 that.2 
 And it ’s interesting now thinking about that in in retrospect and everything 
 that ’s happened it turns out that that piece of the speech was as prescient and 
 maybe even more prescient unfortunately than the reset piece 
 Finally as I said in terms of our approach to the problem we have worked to 
 sustain diplomacy because we do not believe there ’s a military solution to the 
 conflict We ’ve repeatedly tried to give President Putin what we call an off ramp 
 When you ’re driving down the highway and there are exits we call them off ramps 
 Unfortunately each time we 've worked to give him an off ramp he ’s pressed the 
 accelerator and gone right past it 
 So where does that leave us today I think the efforts that we ’ve undertaken 
 together have produced some success They created time and space for the 
 elections that I talked about to take place in an independent Ukraine to allow 
 Ukraine to sign the Accession Agreement with the European Union which was one 
 of the causes of the crisis in the first place 
 And in my judgment at least what ’s happened to date has been a profound 
 strategic loss for Russia that will become more and more clear over time Why do I 
 say that 
 Well first Russia has and Putin has in effect lost 93 percent of Ukraine It is now 
 more united and more Western oriented than ever before And the anger and 
 indeed even hatred directed at Russia is something that will take unfortunately a 
 long time to overcome 
 Russia ’s actions in Ukraine have reenergized NATO in a way we have n’t seen in 
 many years 
 They ’ve also energized Europe ’s efforts to diversify its energy supply to end its 
 dependence on Russia 
 And of course maybe most significantly the Russian economy is in a freefall 
 because of the sanctions because of oil prices declining dramatically and because 
 of mismanagement of the economy that was taking place well before the crisis 
 A record 151 billion dollars in capital has fled the country over the last year 
 Foreign direct investment has basically dried up The ruble is at an all time low 
 despite Russia spending 100 billion dollars in reserves trying to defend it Russia ’s 
 credit credit rating is at what we call junk status The economy which had 
 been growing at a little over two percent before the crisis is predicted to fall into 
 recession this year The sanctions that we ’ve designed including particularly the 
 sanctions on energy technology are going to deny Russia the sophisticated 
 technology it needs to exploit going into the future harder to reach energy 
 sources Inflation ’s running at 15 percent across the country Food prices are up 
 40 percent And unfortunately this is having the effect of hurting average 
 Russians 
 Throughout all of this we have remained united the United States and Europe 
 despite Putin ’s best efforts to divide us And that ’s been maybe our greatest 
 source of strength So that ’s on the positive side of the ledger 
 On the negative side is the reality that the conflict continues And instead of 
 working to end it unfortunately at least up until very recently Russia has been 
 continuing to fuel it 
 In part I think what ’s going on is this Precisely because President Putin does n’t 
 have an economic card to play with his people because he ca n’t deliver for them 
 economically the one card he has left is the nationalist card So it works in the 
 short term It distracts people And you see that in his popularity and approval 
 ratings But the problem with playing the nationalist card is you have to keep 
 playing it because the moment you stop people start to look up and look around 
 and realize that things are n’t going so well And that ’s a very dangerous dynamic 
 to be in not only for Russia and Putin but also for us because how do you break 
 out of it How do you create incentives for Russia and for President Putin to stop 
 the cycle of provocations that he needs to sustain his support at home And that ’s 
 something we ’re grappling with right now 
 Second on the down side of the ledger is the terrible effects that the ongoing 
 conflict is having in Ukraine itself The human toll is significant 1.7 million 
 Ukrainians have been forced to flee from their homes and over 6,000 lives have 
 been lost The Ukrainian economy is right on the edge Ukraine is spending money 
 that it does not have on defense It ’s lost for now the Donbass a part of its 
 economy and that is as you know the manufacturing base and the export driving 
 base of the economy That ’s been taken out of the picture And when there ’s a 
 conflict going on foreign investment is hard to attract because people do n’t want 
 to invest into that kind of uncertainty 
 So we ’ve been compelled to do everything we can in the United States and 
 Germany in Europe the international financial institutions to sustain Ukraine 
 economically and that ’s imposing a cost on us 
 So where do we go from here It ’s a first imperative that we do everything we can 
 to end the conflict in the Donbass and restore Ukraine ’s sovereignty and territorial 
 integrity And that ’s why the efforts of Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande 
 in Minsk on February 12th to try again to end the fighting in Ukraine ’s east are so 
 important and why we so strongly support them 
 The Minsk package of agreements September 5th of last year September 19th 
 and the February 12th implementing agreement offer the promise but not the 
 certainty of peace of disarmament of political normalization of decentralization 
 in eastern Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian state sovereignty and control over 
 its territories and borders 
 This package if it ’s implemented represents a fair deal brokered and agreed to 
 by all sides Russia agreed to it Ukraine agreed to it The separatists agreed to it 
 The international community stands behind it It needs to be implemented And 
 the critical elements of that implementation include a complete ceasefire in all 
 parts of eastern Ukraine That has not yet happened 
 They include full and unfettered access over the whole conflict zone including 
 separatist held territories for the OSCE and the monitors that they employ It has 
 to include a full pull back of heavy weapons Ukrainian Russian separatist 
 monitored and the return of hostages the removal from 
 Ukraine of all foreign forces and weapons and ultimately and most critically the 
 restoration of Ukraine ’s international border Because unless that happens and 
 until that happens Russia will always have and President Putin will always have 
 the possibility to turn up the dial any time he wants sending weapons in 
 sending men in material in and reigniting the conflict So the critical piece which 
 is the last piece in the implementation plan is getting the border back under 
 control giving Ukraine sovereignty over its border with Russia 
 If Russia and the separatists it controls make good on these and other 
 commitments we can and we will start to roll back the sanctions that have been 
 imposed on them On the other hand if they do n’t or if they take further 
 aggressive action we will increase those sanctions and that pressure The choice 
 is clear and it ’s up to President Putin 
 Let me conclude with this Why does any of this matter Why does it matter to us 
 Why should it matter to you Well in the first instance in the United States our 
 concern for Ukraine is about helping a European state meet its democratic 
 aspirations and helping to forge a Europe that is more whole free and at peace If 
 Ukraine is not whole if all of its people are not free and if it ’s not at peace then 
 in a sense Europe is not either 
 But even more than that it is about defending the global rules based system that 
 we are working together to build We all have a stake in upholding those rules 
 that borders and the territorial integrity of the democratic state can not be 
  that rule does not stand countries around the world may 
 presume that their interests too can be advanced at the barrel of a gun 
 Another principle and rule that ’s at stake that it is the inherent right of citizens 
 in a democracy to make their country ’s choices and to determine its future not 
 any outside force or country not the United States not Europe not Russia If not 
 if we do n’t stand up for that rule large states will be given a free pass to bully 
 their neighbors into submission 
 Another principle linguistic nationalism that whoever speaks Russian is 
 Russian should not be allowed to be resurrected If not it will be open season on 
 aggression on conflict and on chaos 
 And finally responsible countries must live up to their international commitments 
 And this is particularly and in a very interesting way resonant in the Ukraine 
 crisis 
 As some of you will remember and as Wolfgang and I know from our direct 
 experience when the Soviet Union dissolved it left several successor states that 
 inherited nuclear weapons Kazakhstan Belarus and Ukraine And we worked 
 very closely together during that period of time to convince those successor states 
 to give up the nuclear weapons they had inherited And in the case of Ukraine the 
 Ukrainians said we ’ll do it but we want guarantees for our territorial integrity and 
 our sovereignty And three guarantors stood up and said you ’ve them the United 
 Kingdom the United States and Russia 
 Now Russia has in effect torn up that solemn commitment that it made and at a 
 time when we ’re trying to get the North Koreans to give up the nuclear weapons 
 they have and at this very moment working to convince Iran to forswear nuclear 
 weapons what does that say to them What would it say to countries around the 
 world who we want not to have nuclear weapons or to give up the weapons they 
 have and who may understandably seek some basic assurances from us what 
 does it say to them when in the case of Ukraine those assurances were blatantly 
 disregarded and trampled   the assuring states in this case Russia It 
 sets a terrible precedent for everything that we ’re trying to achieve 
 So I think what ’s at stake here is on the one hand the European construction 
 project and everything that ’s gone into that but even more even more rules that 
 are central to an international system of peace security prosperity and freedom 
 We have I believe a collective responsibility to uphold those rules and that ’s 
 what we ’re trying to do in the case of Ukraine 
 Just as this crisis reminds us why our transatlantic alliance is so important I think 
 it also reminds us of why it is strong Throughout the decades its resilience has 
 been tested in war it ’s been deepened in peace and it ’s been energized by the 
 ingenuity and the talent of new generations of Atlanticists like I suspect many of 
 the people in this room 
 So as you finish your studies and you think about what you want to do next I only 
 hope that you ’ll deepen your engagement in these issues and continue the work 
 that many of us have started to build the foundation of peace freedom security 
 and prosperity that we hope more than anything else will be our common future

 not yet authenticated 
 But I want to get away from the partisan politics and the nasty allegations that 
 have been made in here just prior to me speaking and back and forth throughout 
 this year because this may well be the last hour that we have here in the House 
 before we recess for Christmas and before we come back next year So instead of 
 getting into all this rancor I thought it would be good to help address an area that 
 some people have just not had education about and that this is the appropriate 
 place Mr. Speaker to make sure that the record is correct because we have so 
 much wonderful history in this building in this House For example I hear people 
 really concerned around this building around the Supreme Court across the way 
 around Capitol Hill here about someone my goodness praying in public Well 
 we begin every day we 're in session here in the House and the Senate 's in session 
 with a prayer 
 Many are ignorant from the place in which that tradition started where it came 
 You have to go back to 1787 the Constitutional Convention The Constitutional 
 Convention people may recall began in 1787 as a result of the failure of the 
 Articles of Confederation And for those that know history they would know that 
 the revolution was won in 1783 It was the Treaty of Paris in which England finally 
 recognized the United States right to exist as a nation And George Washington 
 did something that had never been done in the history of mankind before or since 
 then and that is lead a revolutionary military win the revolution and then 
 resign and go home when he could be Caesar he could be king emperor 
 whatever That was not his goal His goal as he said was to do his duty to God 
 basically and his country kind of like the Scout oath 
 Anyway here they are in Philadelphia Independence Hall 1787 It 's June 
 Benjamin Franklin is 80 years old Now many people say Well we know he was 
 a deist from history That means he believed there was a creator out there but that 
 he believed God the creator created things and then stood back and let 
 everything happen and that he never interfered Well those who also know 
 history know that there were times in his life when Benjamin Franklin sowed some 
 wild seeds and that included some in Europe and in England   of 
 the Constitutional Convention there in Independence Hall in Philadelphia 1787 
 Benjamin Franklin was between 2 and 3 years away from meeting his Judge 
 meeting his Maker and he knew that He was as brilliant as ever as witty an 
 amazing man the genius that he was and there he sits 
 There is a picture right outside the House floor depicting that area in 
 Independence Hall where they were meeting Now in the beautiful painting the 
 windows are open Well the windows were covered It may have been by blankets 
 instead of beautiful lined curtains depicted in the scene But for nearly 5 weeks 
 they went without accomplishing much of anything Finally the 80 year old Ben 
 Franklin rose and was   of the Constitutional 
 Convention George Washington And we have these words because James 
 Madison recorded them as secretary of that convention 
 These are the exact words of Benjamin Franklin June 28 1787 in Philadelphia 
 during the Constitutional Congress Benjamin Franklin said 
 Mr. President the small progress we have made after 4 or 5 weeks 
 close attendance and continual reasonings with each other our 
 different sentiments on almost every question several of the last 
 producing as many noes as ayes is methinks a melancholy proof of 
 the imperfection of human understanding We indeed seem to feel our 
 own want of political wisdom since we 've been running about in search 
 of it We have gone back to ancient history for models of government 
 and examined the different forms of those republics which having been 
 formed with the seeds of their own dissolution now no longer exist 
 And we have viewed modern states all around Europe but find none of 
 their constitutions suitable to our circumstances 
 In this situation of this assembly groping as it were in the dark to find 
 political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us 
 how has it happened sir that we have not hitherto once thought of 
 humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understanding 
 In the beginning contest with Great Britain when we were sensible of 
 danger we had daily prayer in this room Our prayers sir were heard 
 and they were graciously answered All of us who were engaged in the 
 struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending 
 providence in our favor To that kind providence we owe this happy 
 opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our 
 future national felicity And have we now forgotten that powerful 
 friend or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance 
 Ben Franklin goes on and says 
 I have lived sir a long time and the longer I live the more convincing 
 proofs I see of this truth that God governs in the affairs of men And if 
 a sparrow can not fall to the ground without His notice is it probable 
 that an empire can rise without His aid We have been assured sir in 
 the sacred writings that ` except the Lord build the House they labor in 
 vain that build it I firmly believe this and I also believe that without 
 His concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better 
 than the builders of Babel We shall be   partial local 
 interests our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall 
 become a reproach and a byword down to future age And what is 
 worse mankind may hereafter this unfortunate instance despair of 
 establishing   and leave it to chance 
 war and conquest 
 I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the 
 assistance of Heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in 
 this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that 
 one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that 
 service.1 
 His motion was seconded and then Ben Franklin 's motion was adopted 
 unanimously And from that day to this day we do not begin Congress in this body 
 without a prayer to begin 
 Now for those who say Ben Franklin obviously was a deist who did n't believe 
 believed a God or creator created things but never intervened his own words 
 seem to defy that He begged and implored Congress to begin with prayer every 
 day because as he said Our prayers sir were heard and they were graciously 
 answered 
 So Mr. Speaker also here again in the spirit of bipartisanship in the spirit for 
 me of Christmas that has been so historically observed in this Nation we want to 
 just go through and make sure people understand our heritage 
 Now the great thing about our Constitution it does allow for freedom of religion 
 and a freedom not to worship at all That is because they 're based on the 
 teachings of Christ and his willingness to allow all men to make their own 
 decisions for themselves knowing as he did that one day all people will meet 
 their Maker 
 But let 's go back to the person that found the New World as it was called This 
 was Christopher Columbus You do n't find many history books which have these 
 kinds of quotes in it This is Christopher Columbus in his own hand in his own 
 journal He said 
 It was the Lord who put it into my mind I could feel His hand upon me 
 the fact that it would be possible to sail from here to the Indies All who 
 heard of my project rejected it with laughter ridiculing me There is no 
 question that the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit because He 
 comforted me with the rays of marvelous inspiration from the Holy 
 Scriptures 
 Now there are those today who say the real lesson of Columbus is that it 's 
 amazing what you can do even when you do n't know where you 're going you 
 do n't know where you are when you get there so long as you get the government 
 to pay for it But I would submit that there was a creator a creator as Christopher 
 Columbus believed who put this into his mind to sail west and discover this area 
 so that the greatest nation in the history of mankind could arise 
 Now if you go to the Pilgrims who came across originally from the Netherlands to 
 England and to   stopping in England this was 1620 Part of the 
 Pilgrims compact these are their words 
 In the name of God Amen Having undertaken for the glory of God 
 and advancement of the Christian faith and the honor of our king and 
 country a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of 
 Virginia solemnly and mutually in the presence of 
 God and one another covenant and combine ourselves together in a 
 civil body politick 
 That was the Pilgrims on the Mayflower November 11 1620 
 I have had people I have met from Harvard University who are not familiar with 
 their history and the fact that Harvard University September 26 1642 this was 
 part of their code It was part of their handbook 
 Harvard University 
 Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to 
 consider well the main end of his life and studies is to know God and 
 Jesus Christ which is eternal life John 17:3 and therefore to lay Christ 
 in the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and 
 learning And seeing the Lord only giveth the wisdom Let every one 
 seriously set   secret to seek it of him Proverbs 2:3 
 That 's Harvard University at its founding back around the year around 1642 
 In George Washington 's own personal prayer book which he read from daily this 
 is one of the entries in that prayer book that was in Washington 's possession 
 when he passed away 
 O most glorious God and Jesus Christ I acknowledge and confess my 
 faults in the weak and imperfect performance of the duties of this day I 
 called on Thee for pardon and forgiveness of sins but so coldly and 
 carelessly that my prayers are come my sin and stand in need of 
 pardon I have heard Thy holy word but with such deadness of spirit 
 that I have been an unprofitable and forgetful hearer Let me live 
 according to those holy rules which Thou hast this day according to 
 those holy rules which Thou hast this day prescribed in Thy holy 
 word Direct me to the true object Jesus Christ the way the truth 
 and life Bless O Lord all the people of this land 
 That 's George Washington 's prayer book 
 Here is a quote from Thomas Jefferson as we know who wrote basically the 
 Declaration of Independence at the urging of John Adams and it was Jefferson 
 who was the third President after John Adams Jefferson in 1782 and for those 
 who visit Washington this is inscribed inside the Jefferson Memorial 
 Jefferson said Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have 
 removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of people that their 
 liberties are the gift of God 
 Jedidiah Morse who is called the father of the American geography also father of 
 Samuel Morse folks who know history know who that is On April 25 1799 
 Jedidiah Morse said Whenever the pillars of Christianity shall be overthrown our 
 present republican forms of government and all the blessings which flow from 
 them must fall with them 
 James Madison the fourth President March 4 1815 in his Thanksgiving Day 
 proclamation said 
 No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of 
 the Great Disposer of events and of the destiny of nations than the 
 people of the United States His kind providence originally conducted 
 them to one of the best portions of the dwelling place allotted for the 
 great family of the human race He protected and cherished them under 
 all the difficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their early 
 days Under His fostering care their habits their sentiments and their 
 pursuits prepared them for a transition in due time to a state of 
 independence and self government 
 Then John Quincy Adams who was the son of John Adams John Quincy Adams 
 was the sixth President Some think he may have been the smartest President but 
 there 's no way to know He was a brilliant man the youngest diplomat ever 
 appointed in America when he was 11 years of age He knew all the Founders His 
 father John Adams allowed him to accompany him to so many events and things 
 He knew the Founders He knew the founding 
 And John Quincy Adams in 1821 on July 4 said 
 The highest glory of the American Revolution was this it connected in 
 one indissoluble bond the principles of the civil government with the 
 principles of Christianity wherefrom the day of the Declaration they 
 the American people were   of God which they all and 
 by the laws of the Gospel which they nearly all acknowledged as the 
 rules of their conduct 
 Noah Webster 1833 said 
 The moral principles and precepts contained in the Scriptures ought to 
 form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws All the miseries 
 and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice 
 oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting 
 the precepts contained in the Bible 
 Alexis de Tocqueville 1835 said 
 There is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a 
 greater influence over the souls of men than in America and there can 
 be no greater proof of its utility and of its conformity to human nature 
 than that its influence is powerfully felt over the most enlightened and 
 free Nation of the Earth 
 Again John Quincy Adams he was defeated in 1828 for a second term by Andrew 
 Jackson Then in 1830 he believed it was God 's call for him to run for Congress 
 run for the House of Representatives after having been President He was elected 
 and served for 17 years in the House of Representatives just down the hall in 
 Statuary Hall It was John Quincy Adams who was retained to represent the 
 Africans who were aboard the Amistad in their case before the Supreme Court 
 Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job of portraying John Quincy Adams in the 
 movie Amistad I think in the movie his closing argument was around 10 to 12 
 minutes whereas in real life it spilled into a third day 
 John Quincy Adams 1837 after he had been in the House 6 years he said 
 Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social 
 compact on the Foundation of the Redeemer 's mission upon Earth That 
 it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of 
 Christianity 
 And all of these people believed People in America will be able to worship the way 
 they choose or do not choose because the Nation was founded upon Christian 
 precepts that allowed that freedom as no other nation in the history of mankind 
 Andrew Jackson 1845 this was just a few weeks before his death and of course 
 people that know Jackson know that he was quite a rounder and he had quite a 
 life But again as he was just a few weeks before his death he knew he was 
 going to meet his Maker Andrew Jackson said these words 
 Sir I am in the hands of a merciful God I have full confidence in His 
 goodness and mercy The Bible is true I have tried to conform to its 
 spirit as near as possible Upon that sacred volume I rest my hope for 
 eternal salvation through the merits and blood of our blessed Lord and 
 Savior Jesus Christ 
 That was Andrew Jackson just a few weeks before his death May 29 1845 
 Daniel Webster considered the greatest orator probably of all times in this 
 country served in the House served in the Senate thought perhaps he might be 
 President one day but he urged a compromise which cost him the election 
 Whether he was right or wrong he believed if we did n't have the Compromise of 
 1850 then the Nation was doomed that there would be a civil war in 1850 from 
 which the Nation may not survive So he did a very selfless thing and stood up and 
 urged the Compromise of 1850 knowing that he would lose his base But he 
 believed it was to save the country Daniel Webster said in 1852 
 If we and our posterity shall be true to the Christian religion if we and 
 they shall live always in the fear of God and shall respect His 
 Commandments we may have the highest hopes of the future fortunes 
 of our country But if we and our prosperity neglect religious instruction 
 and authority violate the rules of eternal justice trifle with the 
 injunctions of morality and recklessly destroy the political Constitution 
 which holds us together no man can tell how sudden a catastrophe may 
 overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity 
 Daniel Webster 1852 
 Now the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1853 stated this as a committee 
 We are a Christian people not because the law demands it nor to gain 
 exclusive benefits or to avoid legal disabilities but from choice and 
 education and in a land thus universally Christian what is to be 
 expected what desired but that we shall pay due regard to 
 Christianity 
 Senate Judiciary Committee January 19 1853 
 Abraham Lincoln our 16th President February 11 1861 said this 
 Unless the great God who assisted Washington shall be with me and aid 
 me I must fail but if the same Omniscient Mind and Mighty Arm that 
 directed and protected him shall guide and support me I shall not fail 
 Let us all pray that the God of our fathers may not forsake us now 
 Abraham Lincoln February 11 1861 
 We can skip over to the President 's inaugural address 1865 again Abraham 
 Lincoln He said Both talking about both sides of the Civil War the North and 
 the South He said 
 Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God and each invokes 
 His aid against the other The prayers of both could not be answered 
 That of neither has been answered fully The Almighty has His own 
 purposes Woe unto the world because of offenses for if it must needs 
 be that offenses come but woe to that   offense 
 cometh 
 Lincoln in that same inaugural address went on and said If we shall suppose 
 that American slavery is one of those offenses which and he knew it was an 
 offense He knew it to his soul that slavery was an offense and that it would be 
 difficult for God to ever bless America as long as slavery existed And Christian 
 people in this country did not treat their brothers and sisters as brothers and 
 sisters So Lincoln goes on in that address And you can feel the analysis that he 
 did as he went back and forth within himself trying to figure out how a just and 
 mighty God could allow this type of injustice 
 So Lincoln goes on and he says 
 If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses 
 which in the Providence of God must needs come but which having 
 continued through His appointed time He now wills to remove and that 
 He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to 
  offense came shall we discern therein any 
 departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living 
 God ascribe to Him 
 Fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of 
 war may speedily pass away Yet if God wills that it continue until all 
 the wealth 's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be 
 sunk and every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by 
 another drawn with the sword as was said 3,000 years ago so it must 
 still be said ` the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous 
 altogether 
 Lincoln went on 
 With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right 
 as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we 
 are in to bind up the Nation 's wounds to care for him who shall have 
 borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may 
 achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with 
 all Nations 
 Abraham Lincoln 1865 
 Edward Everett the Massachusetts Governor also served as U.S. Secretary of 
 State U.S. Senator he spoke immediately before Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address He 
 said this All the distinctive features and superiority of our Republican 
 institutions and he was n't talking about the Republican Party he was talking 
 about the Nation This is considered a Republic Senator Everett said the 
 superiority of our Republican institutions are derived from the teachings of 
 Scripture 
 William Seward was a U.S. Senator a Governor of New York Secretary of State 
 under Lincoln And it was interesting Lincoln had such a diverse cabinet Many of 
 them did n't like each other did n't like him and yet he took all of that information 
 together and made executive decisions William Seward said 
 I know not how long a Republican Government can flourish among a 
 great people who have not the Bible But this I do know that the 
 existing government of this country never could have had existence but 
 for the Bible And further I do in my conscience believe that if at every 
 decade of years a copy of the Bible could be found in every family in the 
 land its Republican institutions should be perpetuated 
 1862 Andrew Johnson he was Vice President and he said 
 Let us look forward to the time when we can take the Flag of our 
 country and nail it below the cross and there let it wave as it waved in 
 the olden times and let us gather around it and inscribe for our motto 
 Liberty and Union one and inseparable now and forever and exclaim 
 Christ first our country next 
 Ulysses S. Grant the 18th President 1876 said this 
 Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet anchor of your liberties write its 
 precepts in your hearts and practice them in your lives To the influence 
 of this book we are indebted for all the progress made in true 
 civilization and to this we must look as our guide in the future 
 Now Mr. Speaker in reading these quotes I think it is important for people to 
 know I 'm not trying to push my religion on anyone else But I think it is imperative 
 that we at least know where the Founders were where the heart was of those 
 who provided for this incredible government the incredible Nation we have that I 
 believe is the greatest in the history of mankind 
 This was in the case of Church of the Holy Trinity v. the United States in the 
 opinion February 29 1892 The Supreme Court said 
 Our laws and our institutions must necessarily be based upon and 
 embody the teachings of the Redeemer of mankind It is impossible that 
 it should be otherwise and in this sense and to this extent our 
 civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian This is a 
 religious people This is historically true From the discovery of this 
 continent to the present hour there is a single voice making this 
 affirmation We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth 
 These and many other matters which might be noticed at a volume of 
 unofficial declarations to the massive organic utterances that this is a 
 Christian Nation 
 That was the Supreme Court in their opinion Church of the Holy Trinity v. United 
 States 1892 
 Theodore Roosevelt 1917 our 26th President said In this actual world a 
 churchless community a community where men have abandoned and scoffed at 
 or ignored their Christian duties is a community on the rapid downgrade 
 Warren G. Harding our 29th President 1920 said It is my conviction that the 
 fundamental trouble with the people of the United States is that they have gotten 
 too far away from the Almighty God 
 Calvin Coolidge our 30th President 1923 said The foundations of our society 
 and our government rest so much on the teachings of the Bible that it would be 
 difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically 
 universal in our country 
 Franklin D. Roosevelt October 6 1935 said 
 We can not read the history of our rise and development as a Nation 
 without reckoning with the place the Bible has occupied in shaping the 
 advances of the Republic Where we have been the truest and most 
 consistent in obeying its precepts we have attained the greatest 
 measure of contentment and prosperity 
 Again Franklin Roosevelt 1935 
 1943 President Hoover in a joint statement with former First Ladies Mrs. 
 Coolidge Mrs. Roosevelt Mrs. Taft Mrs. Harrison and Mrs. Cleveland gave this 
 statement The whole inspiration for our civilization springs from the teachings of 
 Christ and the lessons of the prophets To read the Bible for these fundamentals is 
 a necessity of American life 
 Harry Truman our 33rd President in 1952 said this 
 The basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings we get from 
 Exodus and St. Matthew from Isaiah and St. Paul I do n't think we 
 emphasize that enough these days If we do n't have a proper 
 fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a 
 government which does not believe in rights for anyone but the State 
 Profound That was Harry Truman 1952 
 Charles Malik our ambassador to the United Nations from Lebanon and the 
 president of the U.N. General Assembly in 1958 made this statement in 1958 
 Whoever tries to conceive the American word without taking full 
 account of the suffering and love and salvation of Christ is only 
 dreaming I know how embarrassing this matter is to politicians 
 bureaucrats businessmen and cynics but whatever these honored men 
 think the irrefutable truth is that the soul of America is at its best and 
 highest Christian 
 That was the U.N. ambassador and president of the U.N. General Assembly in 
 1958 
 Now Ronald Reagan our 40th President 1984 said The frustrating thing is that 
 those who are attacking religion claim they are doing it in the name of tolerance 
 freedom and open mindedness Question Is n't the real truth that they are 
 intolerant of religion They refuse to tolerate its importance in our lives Ronald 
 Reagan 1984 
 Now I point out these quotes from our history I could read volumes and volumes 
 of quotes basically along the same lines not trying to push Christian religion on 
 anyone but just so that people understand where we came from It 's incredible 
 the amount of ignorance on the basis of this Nation the foundation of this Nation 
 Let me go to some of our Founders directly Sam Adams He was called back at 
 that   knew and knew well the Father of the American 
 Revolution Samuel Adams was a signer of the Declaration of Independence In 
 the will of Samuel Adams he says this I recommend my soul to that Almighty 
 Being who gave it and my body I commit to the dust relying upon the merits of 
 Jesus Christ for a pardon of all my sins That was the Father of the American 
 Revolution Samuel Adams 
 In a letter   to Charles Wharton Charles Carroll was a 
 signer of the Declaration of Independence one of the 56 He said On the mercy 
 of my Redeemer I rely for salvation and on His merits not on the works I have 
 done in obedience to His precepts 
 William Cushing was the first Associate Justice 
 to the Supreme Court William Cushing in his will said Sensible of my mortality 
 but being of sound mind after recommending my soul to Almighty God through 
 the merits of my Redeemer and my body to the Earth 
 John Dickinson was also a signer of the Constitution In his will he said 
 Rendering thanks to my Creator for my existence and station among His 
 works for my birth in a country   and enjoying 
 freedom and for all His other kindnesses to Him I resign myself 
 humbly confiding in His goodness and in His mercy through Jesus Christ 
 for the events of eternity 
 Again John Dickinson signer of the Declaration of Independence 
 John Hancock we know signed the Declaration larger than anyone else President 
 of the Continental Congress in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was 
 signed and made public In his will he said 
 I John Hancock being advanced in years and being of perfect mind 
 and memory thanks be given to God therefore calling to mind the 
 mortality of my body and knowing it is appointed for all men once to die 
 Hebrews 9:27 do make and ordain this my last will and testament 
 Principally and first of all I give and recommend my soul into the hands 
 of God that gave it and my body I recommend to the Earth nothing 
 doubting but at the general resurrection I shall receive the same again 
 by the mercy and power of God 
 Again that was John Hancock 
 Patrick Henry the Governor of Virginia a patriot made that stirring speech that I 
 gave on the radio in fifth grade made this statement This is all the inheritance I 
 can give to my dear family this was in his will the religion of Christ can give 
 them one which will make them rich indeed 
 John Jay played such an important role in this Nation 's founding and negotiations 
 of treaties I believe he helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and so many 
 others but he was also the first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court In his 
 will Chief Justice John Jay said 
 Unto Him who is the author and giver of all good I render sincere and 
 humble thanks for His manifold and unmerited blessings and especially 
 for our redemption and   son He has been 
 pleased to bless me with excellent parents with a virtuous wife and 
 with worthy children His protection has accompanied me through many 
 eventful years faithfully employed in the service of my country His 
 providence has not only conducted me to this tranquil situation but 
 also given me abundant reason to be contented and thankful Blessed 
 be His holy name 
 John Jay 
 Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer was a signer of the Constitution In his will he said 
 In the name of God Amen I Daniel St. Thomas Jenifer of disposing mind and 
 memory commend my soul to my blessed Redeemer 
 Henry Knox Revolutionary War general extremely important to the success of the 
 American Revolution said in his will 
 First I think it proper to express my unshaken opinion of the 
 immortality of my soul or mind and to dedicate and devote the same to 
 the supreme head of the universe to that great and tremendous 
 Jehovah who created the universal frame of nature worlds and 
 systems in number infinite To this awfully sublime Being do I resign my 
 spirit with unlimited confidence of His mercy and protection 
 John Langdon was a signer of the Constitution back in 1787 He also said In the 
 name of God Amen I John Langdon considering the uncertainty of life and that it 
 is appointed unto all men once to die again Hebrews 9:27 do make and 
 ordain and publish this my last will and testament 
 John Morton signer of the Declaration of Independence said in his will 
 With an awful reverence to the great Almighty God Creator of all 
 mankind I John Morton being sick and weak in body but sound of 
 mind and memory thanks be given to Almighty God for the same for all 
 His mercies and favors and considering the certainty of death and the 
 uncertainty of the times thereof do for the settling of such temporal 
 estate as it hath pleased God to bless me with in this life 
 There are so many others just one after another vesting these same type things 
 signers of the Declaration of Independence signers of the Constitution 
 Jonathan Trumbull said this in his will 
 Principally and first of all I bequeath my soul to God the Creator and 
 Giver thereof and body to the Earth nothing doubting but that I shall 
 receive the same again at the General Resurrection through the power 
 of Almighty God believing and hoping for eternal life through the merits 
 of my dear exalted Jesus Christ 
 That was Jonathan Trumble who painted four of the paintings that are out here in 
 our Rotunda 
 One of the things that has run throughout this Nation you go back to the 
 Constitution these were the Founders I 've been quoting those who were able to 
 come together and have a Declaration of Independence who sought as Benjamin 
 Franklin said God 's help in the revolution and who sought him in the difficult 
 trying times after the Articles of Confederation were passed And who they sought 
 as Benjamin Franklin pointed out in those great words I read 1787 when 
 afterwards they were finally 
 able to come together with a constitution 
 But as we know from our history the Constitution was not afforded to all people 
 as it should have been They said as these Founders I 've read that they were 
 Christians and yet as Christians they should have recognized that we could not 
 expect God to bless America while we were treating our brothers and sisters by 
 putting them in chains and bondage 
 Martin Luther King came along after the Civil War Abraham Lincoln as I 've read 
 made clear his beliefs in the Almighty and His grace and mercy and justice and 
 that 's why he pushed for an end of slavery But even still it took Dr. Martin Luther 
 King Jr. and those who worked with him to bring about civil rights and an 
 abdication of the supreme Constitution that we hold so dear to all people It 
 does n't require that everyone receive equal things it requires equal opportunity 
 I would remind my friends that Martin Luther King Jr. was an ordained Christian 
 minister He said in his letter from Birmingham jail But more basically I am in 
 Birmingham because injustice is here Just as the prophets of the 8th century B.C. 
 left their villages and carried their thus saith the Lord far beyond the boundaries 
 of their home towns and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and 
 carried the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the four corners of the Greco Roman world 
 so I am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town Like 
 Paul I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid That was in 1963 
 Profound words Martin Luther King 
 One of his quotes in 1963 from Birmingham jail 
 Whenever the early Christians entered the town the people in power 
 became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for 
 being disturbers of the peace and outside agitators But the Christians 
 pressed on and in the conviction that they were a colony of heaven 
 called to obey God rather than man small in number they were big in 
 commitment They were too God intoxicated to be astronomically 
 intimidated 
 Powerful powerful words Martin Luther King 
 Well I think it 's worth noting also we have an original copy of the Treaty of Paris 
 1783 located in the Department of State in a glass case I did n't realize how that 
 started until I saw that copy there but it made sense once I saw it In big bold 
 letters at the top of the Treaty of Paris this is the one that was negotiated in Paris 
 in 1783 after surrendering at Yorktown to get England to sign onto a treaty 
 indicating they would observe the United States right to exist as an independent 
 Nation 
 It starts out in big block bold letters In the name of the most holy and undivided 
 Trinity When I first saw that I thought I wonder why they would start like that 
 And then you realize you 're asking the nation of England to sign a treaty and 
 pledging not to ever attack or fail to recognize its right to exist independently of 
 England What do you get them to swear under that is so important and so 
 manifest that they would not dare go back on their word Well they decided at 
 that time it was to start with the words In the name of the most holy and 
 undivided Trinity 
 Those who are familiar with the War of 1812 1814 we 're up here on Jenkins Hill 
 where the Capitol was built and the British proceeded across burning every public 
 building proceeded to the Capitol set fire down the hall in Statuary Hall what 
 was then the House of Representatives went down and set fire to the Senate Inn 
 and went to the White House set fire there The White House was terribly 
 damaged inside 
 The  with the intensity of the fire and with the munitions that 
 were spread to make the fire get more hot should have collapsed and fallen in on 
 itself but it did n't because a rain came and put out the fire 
 By the way the next day there was such a huge straight line wind Some thought 
 it was tornadic but most believed it was a straight line wind It was so intense 
 that it blew their canons off their mounts Some credit the wind with killing 
 soldiers As the British troops were preparing to leave a conversation was noted 
 between the British admiral and a Washington lady regarding the storm The 
 admiral exclaimed Great God Madam Is this the kind of storm to which you are 
 accustomed in this infernal country The lady answered No sir This is a special 
 interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city The weather drove 
 them out The American soldiers were not able to 
 A little history about the White House nativity scene It 's Italian made in Naples 
 around the time of the United States War for Independence the late 1700s It has 
 been on exhibit in the East Room of the White House during the holiday season 
 since 1967 In 1999 a new tableau was made for the nativity scene The design of 
 the new display was   presepios which is the 
 Italian term for Christ from the Baroque period which incorporated 
 architectural elements found in the 1700s That is a little bit about the nativity 
 scene There has been a lot said about that recently 
 As far as the history of the White House Christmas tree in 1889 the tradition of 
 placing an indoor decorated tree in the White House began on Christmas morning 
 during the Presidency of Benjamin Harrison It was in 1895 that First Lady Frances 
 Cleveland created a technology savvy tree when she hung electric lights on the 
 White House tree which was introduced into the White House in 1891 
 There is just so much history with our Founding Fathers Franklin D. Roosevelt 
 December 24 obviously Christmas Eve 1934 said This is the second year 
 that I have joined with you on this happy occasion Then as now with millions of 
 others we celebrate the happy observance of Christmas The year toward which 
 we looked then with anticipation and hope has passed Roosevelt goes on We 
 have seen fulfilled many things that a year ago were only hopes Our human life 
 thus goes on from anticipation and hope to fulfillment This year again we are 
 entitled to new hopes and new anticipations 
 He goes on and he says Just across the street is the house he occupied 100 years 
 ago the house the people of the country have built for their Presidents From its 
 windows I see this monument to this man of courage He is talking about 
 Washington It is an inspiration to me as it should be to all Americans And so 
 let us make the spirit of Christmas of 1934 that of courage and unity It is the way 
 to greater happiness and well being That is I believe an important part of what 
 the Maker of Christmas would have it mean In this sense Roosevelt says the 
 scriptures admonish us to be strong and of good courage to fear not to dwell 
 together in unity He said I wish you one and all here and everywhere a very 
 very Merry Christmas Franklin Roosevelt 
 I have a number of other speeches that he gave on Christmas Time will not allow 
 me to read all of those I will go to 1962 John F. Kennedy when he said 
 Ladies and gentlemen Secretary Udall members of the clergy With the 
 lighting of this tree which is an old ceremony in Washington and one 
 which has been among the most important responsibilities of a good 
 many Presidents of the United States we initiate in a formal way the 
 Christmas season We mark the festival of Christmas which is the most 
 sacred and hopeful day in our civilization For nearly 2,000 years the 
 message of Christmas the message of peace and goodwill towards all 
 men has been the guiding star of our endeavors 
 This morning I had a meeting at the White House which included some 
 of our representatives from far countries in Africa and Asia They were 
 returning to their posts for the Christmas holidays Talking with them 
 afterwards I was   that in the far off continents 
 Muslims Hindus Buddhists as well as Christians pause from their 
 labors on the 25th day of December to celebrate the birthday of the 
 Prince of Peace 
 There could be no more striking proof that Christmas is truly the 
 universal holiday of all men It is the day when all of us dedicate our 
 thoughts to others when all are reminded that mercy and compassion 
 are the enduring virtues when all   and large and 
 by acts that it is more blessed to give than to receive 
 He goes on to talk about the Christmas spirit 
 As my time grows short here I want to finish with a speech Ronald Reagan gave 
 his Christmas message in 1988 He said 
 The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have long 
 been intertwined in song and story There is a profound irony and 
 lesson in this because Christmas celebrates the coming of a Savior who 
 was born without a home There was no room at the inn for the Holy 
 Family Weary of travel a young Mary close to childbirth and her 
 carpenter husband Joseph found but the rude shelter of a stable 
 There was born the King of Kings the Prince of Peace an event on 
 which all history would turn Jesus would again be without a home and 
 more than once on the flight to Egypt and during His public ministry 
 when He said The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests 
 but the Son of man hath nowhere to lay his head 
 Ronald Reagan goes on 
 From His very infancy on our Redeemer was reminding us that from 
 then on we would never lack a home in Him Like the shepherds to 
 whom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day we 
 could always say ` Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this 
 thing which is come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us 
 As we come home with gladness to family and friends this Christmas 
 let us also remember our neighbors who can not go home themselves 
 Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all year long will mean 
 much to the hospitalized the homeless the convalescent the orphaned 
 and will surely lead us on our way to the joy and peace of Bethlehem 
 and the Christ Child who bids us come For it is only in finding and living 
 the eternal meaning of the Nativity that we can be truly happy truly at 
 peace truly home 
 Merry Christmas and God bless you

152,Admiral Philip S. Davidson,Address at the 75th Anniversary of the End of World War II Commemoration Ceremony,2020," Aloha and good morning I would like to   the members of the 
 75th World War II Commemoration Committee for safely bringing these 
 phenomenal events together in this COVID-19 environment 
 We are honored today to have the Secretary of Defense here with us to help 
 commemorate the occasion as well as his wife Leah Thank you Mr. Secretary 
 We 're grateful that you could both be here today 
 I 'd like to thank General Milley for joining us virtually and for his moving remarks 
 And of course thank you Governor Ige for your inspiring words They underscore 
 the significance of the State of Hawaii ’s magnificent relationship with our Armed 
 Forces 
 As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and our Allied 
 victory in the Pacific we remain forever indebted to our World War II veterans 
 They helped defend the world from tyranny 
 We are deeply honored that those from Hawaii some of those very same veterans 
 could join us today in person with many more joining us virtually around the 
 globe And indeed the rest of them are here with us in spirit on the historic deck 
 of the USS Missouri 
 This battleship both signal of strength and symbol of peace owes much of its 
 legacy to the 33rd President of the United States Harry S. Truman 
 It was hardly a surprise when President Truman selected the USS Missouri as the 
 formal site to officially end the war 
 After all the proud Missouri native ’s only child Margaret served as this ship ’s 
 sponsor and President Truman spoke at this ship ’s christening and also attended 
 her commissioning 
 Well one can only imagine how President Truman hoped the pride and joy of his 
 home state would live on in the hearts and minds of Americans for years to come 
 And I mention this for two important reasons 
 First to highlight that the Mighty Mo this iconic American museum today is 
 the epitome of the Arsenal of Democracy that willed us to victory In part 
 honoring the men and women of our Greatest Generation who supported the war 
 effort in factories and shipyards across the country 
 And of course the second reason is to provide a clear reminder of how the history 
 of September 2nd 1945 lives on 
 September 2nd is the day that the United States and our Allies turned tragedy into 
 triumph violence into victory fighting into freedom loss into liberty and peril 
 into peace.1 
 A day that marks the very beginning of the rules based international order an 
 order responsible for some 75 years of peace prosperity and security that helped 
 not only to liberate hundreds of millions but to lift billions out of poverty and all 
 to a level of prosperity previously unseen in human history 
 Certainly the post war period of regional peace and stability must not be taken for 
 granted 
 Today the world faces great challenges You heard Governor Ige talk about the 
 coronavirus pandemic 
 But as well an emboldened Communist Party of China seeks to change the world 
 to one in which Chinese national power is more important than international law 
 Beijing is using a whole of party approach to coerce to corrupt and to contest2 
 the rules based international order 
 Today as we address the strategic threat of China and the other security 
 challenges throughout the Indo Pacific region the memory of our Greatest 
 Generation lives on It lives on in our Soldiers our Sailors our Airmen our 
 Marines and our Coast Guardsmen today 
 Each and every day we remember our World War II heroes and we pay tribute to 
  defend the values of a Free and Open Indo Pacific to keep 
 America our allies and partners free from tyranny and to defend our shared 
 values our inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
 May God bless all the veterans of World War II the men and women of the Armed 
 Forces the Great State Hawaii and indeed may God bless the United States of 
 America

153,Jerome Powell,Federal Reserve Monthly Press Conference Opening Statement,2020," Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us 
 Our country continues to face a difficult and challenging time as the pandemic is 
 causing tremendous hardship here in the United States and around the world 
 People have lost loved ones Many millions have lost their jobs There is great 
 uncertainty about the future 
 At the Federal Reserve we are strongly committed to using our tools to do 
 whatever we can and for as long as it takes to provide some relief and stability 
 to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible and to limit lasting 
 damage to the economy 
 The most important response to this crisis has come from our health care workers 
 And on behalf of the Federal Reserve let me express our sincere gratitude to 
 those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk day after day in service to 
 others and to our nation Let me also thank the many other essential workers 
 across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services 
 in these difficult times 
 The virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread have induced a 
 sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses Indicators of spending 
 and production plummeted in April and the decline in real GDP in the current 
 quarter is likely to be the most severe on record Even after the unexpectedly 
 positive May employment report nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since 
 February and the unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points to 
 13.3 percent 
 As was   of Labor Statistics this figure likely understates 
 the extent of unemployment accounting for the unusually large number of 
 workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would 
 raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points The downturn has not 
 fallen equally on all Americans and those least able to shoulder the burden have 
 been the most affected In particular the rise in joblessness has been especially 
 severe for lower wage workers for women and for African Americans and 
 Hispanics 
 In recent weeks some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound 
 in some segments of the economy such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle 
 sales Employment rose in many sectors of the economy in May and the 
 unemployment edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from 
 temporary layoffs With the easing of social distancing restrictions across the 
 country people are increasingly moving about and many businesses are resuming 
 operations to varying degrees At the same time many households have been 
 receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits which are supporting 
 incomes and spending 
 Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up however and overall 
 output is far below earlier levels Moreover despite the improvements seen in the 
 May jobs report unemployment remains historically high Weak demand 
 especially in sectors most is holding down consumer 
 prices As a result inflation has fallen well below our symmetric 2 percent 
 objective Indicators of longer term inflation expectations have been fairly steady 
 The extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily 
 uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus We 
 all want to get back to normal but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people 
 are confident that it is safe to 
 reengage in a broad range of activities 
 The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all 
 levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public 
 health crisis passes The Fed ’s response is   to promote 
 maximum employment and stable prices for the American people along with our 
 responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system We are committed 
 to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time In 
 March we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero where we expect 
 to keep it until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events 
 and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals 
 We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit 
 in the economy Without access to credit families could be forced to cut back on 
 necessities or even lose their homes Businesses could be forced to downsize or 
 close resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn 
 Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the 
 economy and setting the stage for the recovery 
 Since March we 've been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency 
 mortgage backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these 
 markets which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy Our ongoing 
 purchases have helped to restore orderly market conditions and have fostered 
 more accommodative financial conditions As market functioning has improved 
 since the strains experienced in March we have gradually reduced the pace of 
 these purchases To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the 
 effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions we will 
 increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage backed securities over 
 coming months at least at the current pace We will closely monitor developments 
 and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals 
 The Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the 
 financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy 
 for households for businesses of all sizes and for state and local governments 
 These programs benefit the   where it is not 
 otherwise available In  a backstop to key credit markets 
 the programs can increase the willingness of private lenders to extend credit 
 Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only 
 in very unusual circumstances such as these those we find ourselves in today 
 We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent enabled in 
 large   and support from Congress and from the Treasury 
 We will continue to use these powers forcefully proactively and aggressively until 
 we 're confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery When the time comes 
 after the crisis has passed we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox 
 I would stress that these are lending powers not spending powers The Fed 
 can not grant money to particular beneficiaries We can only create programs or 
 facilities with broad based eligibility to make loans to solvent entity entities 
 with the expectation that the loans will be repaid 
 Many borrowers will benefit from these programs as will the overall economy But 
 for many others getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the 
 answer In these cases direct fiscal support may be needed Elected officials have 
 the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we as a society 
 should direct our collective resources The CARES Act and other legislation provide 
 direct help to people and businesses and communities This direct support can 
 make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of 
 need but also in limiting long lasting damage to our economy 
 At this meeting my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for 
 conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound The 
 measures we discussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset 
 purchases we used these tools in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and 
 they have become a standard part of our toolkit We also reviewed the historical 
 and foreign experience with targeting interest rates along the yield curve 
 Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools remains an 
 open question We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will 
 evaluate our monetary policy stance and communications as more information 
 about the trajectory of the economy becomes available 
 We also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections or the 
 SEP The SEP is an input into our deliberations not an outcome and it does not 
 represent a Committee view Rather FOMC participants write down their 
 individual views of the most likely path for the economy conditioned on each 
 participant ’s view of appropriate monetary policy We tabulate those submissions 
 and we publish them as the SEP 
 Given the unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook many participants 
 noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy and that 
 it 's not possible to identify with confidence a single path as the most likely one 
 Nonetheless we believe that regular publication of the SEP provides a useful 
 perspective on the way FOMC participants are assessing the path ahead 
 What the June SEP shows is a general expectation of an economic recovery 
 beginning in the second half of this year and lasting over the next couple of years 
  that remain at their current level near zero Of course 
 my colleagues and I will continue to base our policy decisions on the full range of 
 plausible outcomes and not on a particular forecast The risk management 
 approach This rich risk management approach is the best way we can 
 promote our maximum employment and price stability goals in these unusually 
 uncertain circumstances 
 Finally I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on 
 the pain of racial injustice in this country The Federal Reserve serves the entire 
 nation We operate in and are part of many of the communities across the 
 country where Americans are grappling 
 with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality 
 I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say 
 there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place 
 for it in our society Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our 
 society and in our economy These principles guide us in all we do from monetary 
 policy to our focus on diversity and inclusion in our workplace and to our work to 
 ensure fair access to credit across the country 
 We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these 
 principles We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities families 
 and businesses across the country Everything we do is in service to our public 
 mission We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy 
 and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as 
 possible
